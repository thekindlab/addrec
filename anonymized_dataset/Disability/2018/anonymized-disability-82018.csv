The funding is provided by the state, the service is overseen by a case manager at Community Mental Health and the individual hires their own staff to help them.
Locally I know many people with developmental disabilities who are able to live in their own apartments or in an apartment with a room mate with the help of this program.
You may want to reach out to your local CMH to see if a similar program exists in your state. 

Other alternatives would of course be an assisted living community or adult foster care home. LARA would have a listing of AFC homes within your county. 

Good luck!",,,12,0,0,

AODA requires every public sector organization and every private sector organization with more than I think 50 employees, to provide a certain level of accessible information under the Information and Communication Standards and they themselves cite this as 
&gt;Upon request, accessible formats and communication supports shall be provided in a timely manner that takes into account the person’s accessibility needs, at a cost no more than what is regular, and in consultation with the person making the request to determine the suitability of what is provided. This extends to emergency procedures, educational and training resources, and libraries of educational and training institutions, as well as the opportunity for an individual to provide feedback.

So literally the training you would ideally receive would tell you that yeah they owe you, and by not providing accessible training they are not following the spirit of AODA. Now, whether any of this has any actual ramifications, I don't know. My training wasn't accessible either (small text, no screen reader, mismatched transcription and text) so I think AODA training sucks for accessibility in the first place, but the fact that they are shirking their responsibility to provide training for you is wrong!

The trial work period that you described is for work, or earned income. The easy way to figure this out is if you pay Social Security taxes on the income, then it is earned, and it could potentially affect your benefits (or take up one of your trial work period months. 

Now for SSI (Supplemental Security Income), all income and all resources can affect your payment amount. This program is a needs based program, not a program based on your work history. 

The easy way to figure out which program you receive is to look a letter with your claim number at the top. If it ends in DI, then it is SSI. If it ends in HA, then it is Social Security Disability. It gets confusing because both programs have the same medical criteria, and they frequently work together. 

Sometimes, people receive benefits from both programs. If this is the case, then you would get SSI on the 1st of the month and Social Security Disability on the 3rd of the month. 

TLDR: Check your claim number, which should be your SSN followed by a letter code.
999-99-9999DI is SSI, and gifts could affect that
999-99-9999HA is Social Security Disability, and unearned Income has no effect.

What happens is you experience trauma. This trauma can be related to how your brain processes emotions when the experience is consciously denied. Physically, people deny themselves the motion required to process emotions. They hold themselves down.  This long-term pattern of behavior causes PTSD. 

It's not something that's done on purpose. A good example is American Sniper. He was doing his job. He did it well. It still causes PTSD. 

People with borderline characteristic are particularly susceptible. Borderline refers to Borderline Personality Disorder. It's more of an emotional control disorder that is poorly named and definitely not understood by the general population. The areas behind your temples have your emotional processing. It's call the Anterior Cingular Gyrus or Cortex. The brain has white matter and grey matter. More white matter in this area means less emotional control. The grey part has less connections because it's not as thick as average. 

There's more to the explanation, but there's the start. ",,,1,0,0,

ab2f8393-69de-42a4-9acd-8a5477807dbe,1533835110,"From your survey page:

&gt; People sometimes make comments or ask questions that are awkward, misguided, patronizing, ridiculous, inappropriate, hurtful, offensive, and/or infuriating to people with disabilities. At best these comments/questions are well-intended but naive or uninformed, and often based on assumptions or stereotypes about disabled people. At worst, they are bullying or discriminatory.   

Let me publicly share a story with you.

First time I really had a conversation with a person with a disability, it was with someone with severe Cerebral Palsy.

I asked a whole bunch of questions which, in hindsight were horribly inappropriate.  Things like:  ""Are you contagious?""

Wow... I cringe just typing that.

Since she was a non-verbal quadriplegic, with no functional use of her arms or legs, and unable to speak vocally, she patiently explained everything to me, keying out Morse code with her head switches, which was translated by her communicator.

Today, we are married with a 12 year old son, and we both live a very full, and enriched lives... even beyond most people who are ""temporarily able bodied"" (Is that even a thing now)?

The way to break stereo types is to ask questions.  Sure sometimes the questions are misguided and can be insulting.  But, it's much more insulting to many people NOT to ask the questions... to just avoid eye contact, and walk the other way.

And, walk the other way is what I would have probably done with my wife if I had to follow some kind of template to communicate with a disabled person, lest I offend them.",,,1,0,0,

Definitely ask about backrest height, if there’s an adjustable camber bar, or what the centre of gravity is, if the back folds (a rigid back can be very difficult to load/unload from a car independent as I found out the hard way) if the footplate is adjustable, if the bearings are new or when they were last replaced, what size the wheels are - 24 inch wheels are much easier to find tyres for - the distance from the seat sling to the footplate, taking into account how thick your cushion is, how much bucket the seat has. 

TiLite tends to be really adjustable and the frames don’t have pre-drilled holes, so you have way more flexibility with making adjustments. 

If I can offer one bit of advice, get some helicopter tape and stick it on the frame. It’ll make it look better for longer and save chips and dents to the frame. ",,,3,0,0,

I believe the appropriate Monty Python quote is something like:

“Now we see the violence inherent in the system! Help! Help! I’m being repressed!”

The agony and destruction so often present in the excessive amount of time required to process and, hopefully, approve applications, plus wait time to even receive benefits, is nothing short of violent repression/oppression. Many people lose everything, or close to, while they wait. And, it’s senseless. I don’t blame the individual workers as many of them do, from what I gather, attempt to work cases well, but the system itself needs adequate funding and an overhaul of the approval process. Too many people are denied who ought to be approved. The vindication of finally being approved after years in the process does nothing to address the losses sustained during the wait. ",,,2,0,0,

Instead of saying that you have aspergers and GAD, just tell your boss that your communication/social skills need work and that people make you a little nervous. also, in any sort of workplace situation if you are going to point out an issue you should also offer solutions.

-

for example, instead of saying you have aspergers, it might be better to say something like.... customers make me kind of nervous and awkward. it might be better if someone else deals with them. would it be alright if i go in the back and take care of inventory or some other job that no one likes to do?

another strategy is to get good at doing work that everyone else either dislikes or can't do.

If you read the messages, I think it's pretty obvious how disappointed I am that they refuse to care about this. Part of the challenges (visibly) disabled people face have to do with not being taken seriously as adults/people, and I think this really exemplifies that. Obviously not everyone will agree on this, but I'd love to hear everyone's opinions. I kinda really hate it and am not happy with them ignoring my questions about if posts like ""my friend took my Asian brother to prom"" would be any more acceptable than saying someone took a disabled person to prom.

As an aside, I think it would be interesting to open this conversation up to people who aren't subbed here and see if others actually would think what I was saying is ableist like that mod said. Unfortunately, based on the response I received, I don't think R/aww would allow that. The only other place I could possibly think of would be something like R/SubredditDrama but I don't know if this is exactly ""drama"" and I'm not allowed to post ""my own"" drama anyway. Obviously we don't need to be told how to feel about our own problems, but I'm still curious if abled people really would view not posting about disabled people is ableist.

6ef2492b-4a72-4170-a246-0d3f3c11855a,1535145610,"I live on the east coast US and apartments are just as expensive here. Most disabled people in the US have to live in cities because there is no public transit outside cities, and cities here have pretty high rents that are comparable to Toronto. The majority of people here also don't get any where near the cap, I think the average payout is $400/month though I'm sure that is also true for y'all. A lot of the homeless in this country are disabled folks. There are places in the US where cost of living is low, but disability payments are subsequently lowered if someone lives there. Most don't bother because of the lack of public transit. Being homeless in a city can end up being better than housed out in rural areas where you can't get food or medical care.

The food stamp program in most of the US is only available to single parents with kids unless you live in NY, NJ or California. In those states you can qualify if you make less than $200/month after expenses. But yes, we do have soup kitchens through churches and food pantries run by non-profits. The public schools do food drives every year for them. It's not really adequate to keep people fed, but the non-profits do whatever they can.

I think the biggest difference is that you guys have socialized healthcare and in the US the disabled are given really really shitty health coverage and still have to pay for a lot of medical costs. I have been unable to get medications that I need because of this and unable to get certain medical treatments my Dr wanted to do.

But anyways, I wasn't trying to imply that Canada is paying too much, I was just surprised at how badly lagging behind the US is from a lot of other countries when it comes to disability payments.

 I sort of understand the ideas of ""get authorities involved in questionable situations"" and not necessarily understanding why someone is outside your door and flipping out. See the very good points about *New York* in the video. I lived in NYC for several months. I loved it, because I was never the weirdest person in visual range. I wasn't aware that I'm autistic at the time, but I realized quickly I was way to socially oblivious and would sit there totally unaware of criminal activity a few feet away and then panic when I realized, and this was not entirely safe. I did eventually learn not to panic and to totally ignore and relocate, and even later to notice some signs of suspicious activity and leave before the criminal activity started, but generally, avoidance, not involvement is something she ought to have learned by now simply for self preservation. 

You aren't automatically involved simply be being present you can just walk away and ignore something is happening. This was something that took me years to learn, but was a critical lesson I had pretty much down by that point. That should have been enough, but if it wasn't enough, there's and even more obvious thing here she really ought to have figured out by now.

NEVER EVER EVER CALL THE POLICE UNLESS YOU HONESTLY BELIEVE IT IS WORTH DEATH. White, black, male, female, disabled, autistic, mentally ill, liberal, conservative, does not matter, *every* group has had at least some deadly mistakes, and as an autistic, she really has no excuse not to be aware of how easily autistic people can be that mistake, even if she were somehow unaware of the potential consequences to others. 

I don't hate the police, I don't think most necessarily target anyone maliciously (with obvious exceptions)

Police are people with power. People make mistakes and are flawed, power makes those mistakes and flaws dangerous. The way things are now, it is set up to encourage the sort of mistakes that kill autistics, and to ignore the sorts of attitudes that increase both targeting and misunderstandings with all groups. If they do their job correctly and not ""above and beyond"" I'm by nature of my disabilities a walking misunderstanding and a mistake waiting to happen. If I'm calling the cops, it's because I already believe I'm already dead, and more will die if I don't. The emergency standard may be the legal standard, but I don't necessarily believe it to be the moral one. ",,,1,0,0,

But a feeling must never determine wholly the things you believe and the things you do.

Its a complicated thing. 
On one hand, you deserve love just as much as any human being upon this earth. Your heart was made for this very thing. Your heart deserves love as much as flowers deserve sun. 

On the other hand, one must make the effort to procure this love. Deserving does not mean having. Like a flower that by misfortune or fate settles itself into a dark corner will surely die, “deserving” is a factor that matters little in what follows.

But see how even a flower, a simple little thing, strives with all its efforts to reach the light. It does not think whether it deserves the sun or not, it only follows what it was made to cherish. 

But you are not like a flower. For all its tender and delicate beauty, you are better, and far, far more powerful then a flower... For you do not have to be whim to capricious fate, like a flower helplessly doomed to die in a dark corner.

All independent manual users I know in person do this as well. They mentioned the need to transfer in a post reply and later that your chair will need to be able to fold as an electric. As an electric chair user in a solid chair though I'm sure you're aware that you will need a van.

I'm not seeing where they ignored the basic questions? They're a bit of a jumble, I assume OP is posting from mobile as they're not direct replies to posts, that happens to me sometimes and I don't even know it's happened until I get to a computer. I've matched them up to help with readability.

------------------------

&gt; *I’m considering one of these but I don’t have a garage. Is that a dealbreaker? How do you charge it?*

&gt;&gt; You don’t actually require a garage as you can just plug it directly into a normal socket at home as long as you have off road parking :) hope that helps :)

-------
&gt; *Well, let's see. I am disabled and on SSDI and no insurance and not working and missing my right foot sooo...I'm gonna have to pass.*

&gt;&gt; Well that is where you may be wrong as this car has something call an e-pedal which means you can actually drive this car with just one foot without having to swap between the accelerator and brake pedal so it may actually be worth a look ������

&gt; *Will standard hand controls work with the e-pedal?*

&gt;&gt; Yes the e-pedal does work with hand controls ��

------
&gt; *What features exactly make it great for “disabled” users? Can you explain what you mean? Might be a fun car, but it looks impractical for drivers who are wheelchair users...*

&gt;&gt; Absolutely, firstly the seat height is perfect for transferring, it is very comfortable and it has heated leather seats which I personally think leather seats make a transfer even easier, it has a gadget called e-pedal which enables you to drive with just the one pedal which makes it easier if you suffer from joint pain, it has very light steering, all in all if you are able to transfer into cars then this car would be great as we also are wheelchair users and managed better in this car than your standard car however we totally understand everyone’s needs are different all we do is just give people an idea on how suitable cars actually are.

----
&gt; *Is this thing able to carry my power chair? If I can find something cheaper than a minivan that can haul it around that would be great.*

&gt;&gt; If you are able to transfer I do believe it would be suitable for you to ride in as the transfer height is amazing however I am not too sure on it carrying a powered chair and to get a wheelchair in the boot it would need to be folded unfortunately but it really is an amazing car ��

&gt; *Okay I can transfer but I'm not sure how I would put a power chair in the back of this car after I've all ready transferred.*

&gt;&gt; We take a carer with us when we go out in the car so our carer would put the wheelchair in the boot for us ��

&gt; *I can't afford a carer or whatever, I'm more or less on my own so this isn't really good for independent use.*

&gt;&gt; That is a fair comment and totally understandable ������

Other comments are about not being about to afford a car or it not being suitable (or heated seats making you need to poop. Thanks /u/1f412cf7-1c60-45ef-8355-74adf1174c04, you gave me a giggle. Very true though!) . Those things are fine, not everyone can afford a car and everyone's disability is different. But this is suitable for some chair users and I believe they answered questions pretty fairly, albeit in a jumble. 

I particularly love the post that decided my C4 quad friend has 'a slight physical issue' because he drives a car similar to this. I'll make sure and tell him. Gatekeeping of disability severity in a disability subreddit...not impressed.

df8397fe-743c-4ce0-a287-432497c3d49a,1533786664,"Here's what I can remember from applying..... As many have told me, it is super difficult to get approved w/o a lawyer because sooo many people are applying for disability and they normally get rejected after their first attempt. So I had to get a lawyer after my disability was denied and I then requested to have my hearing in front of a judge. My lawyer was super helpful during this part since she knew exactly what to expect and what was needed. This particular lawyer was also recommend by the social worker who helped me fill out the initial forms. That's another thing - there's a lot of free resources who will help you with forms and terminology and all the stuff disability people will be looking for. But I understand you are housebound (I've been there myself) but it is super important you go to any and all dr. appointments so you have documented proof. Same with the mental health. That's so important. I dealt w/ both the physical and mental aspects myself. You can go to discounted clinics if you have no insurance (this is what I had to do) and the info they provided to disability was just as legit. Has disability contacted you and sent you to their approved doctor(s) to be evaluated yet? The hardship letter sounds new to me... But I did fill out tons and tons of forms so I don't remember everything. I had the same problems with gabapentin (and more) so I understand the suicide stuff. That's why I recommend addressing the mental health aspect too. I mean the judge at my hearing even asked if I was hospitalized for suicide attempts. So its sounds like it's not something they gloss over. But attending dr. appointments (physical and mental), taking all prescribed meds and documenting doses, along w/ their side effects, contacting your local ssi office to see if someone can help you with the forms, and finding a social worker to help you with the forms (and maybe they can help you find a lawyer if/when needed) is some of the best things you can do to help yourself and what was recommend to me by everyone. I went through this a year ago and will have to go through it all again next year so some of this is still fresh and I'm doing my best to jog my memory (despite all the side effects of my meds) so hopefully I've given you some decent advice and I'm sorry this got so long but I wish you all the best in this.

Things that would not have bothered me before loom much larger because I'm essentially trapped.

It seems older people struggle with not having things their way. My grandmother who is 90 couldn't handle the slightest bit of compromise, and my late 60s parents struggle with what appear to be reasonable requests. I think its just the result of decades of making all of the decisions.

Not only do they dislike compromise, they certainly don't like feeling that they need to justify themselves. I had the argument over half gallon vs full gallon, and it literally took 6 months to make the folks see that we were pouring milk down the drain because it would go bad before it was used, them we'd be out, It was a constant source of irritation if we had room for another full gallon etc.

To someone that has not been in this position, it might seem silly, but combine 15 or 20 of these issues and its death by a thousand paper cuts, it makes for an unpleasant time for all involved.

I had a roommate for 5 out of the last 10 years before I became disabled, some give and take was just the way things were.

The way that claims numbers work is that the number (or SSN) refers to the earnings record that the benefit is based on. The letter after the number refers to the beneficiary's relationship to that earnings record. Ex: ""A"" means that the earnings record belongs to the beneficiary. ""C"" means that the earnings record belongs to the parent of the beneficiary. These are Beneficiary Identification Codes (BICs).

I couldn't find the exact POMS reference for the list of BICs, but the state of Washington has a list that appears accurate: https://www.dshs.wa.gov/book/export/html/1901

This applies to the Title 2 Program of the Social Security Act, or more commonly known and the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program. The easy way to keep Disability and Retirement (Old Age) straight in your head is that the Disability benefit is roughly equal to the Retirement benefit at full retirement age and adjusted for the fact that an individual receiving disability benefits was not able to work as long as an individual who was not receiving disability.

Title 16 of the Social Security Act (Supplemental Security Income or SSI) is not related to an individual's work history. The claim number will always be the beneficiary's SSN followed by DI (Disabled Individual), BI (Blind Individual), AI (Aged Individual), DC (Disabled Child), or BC (Blind Child). Take that list with a grain of salt because it is based on my bad memory, so I am probably missing something.

Since Title 16 (SSI) is paid from general tax revenue, it is not necessary to link the claim to the earnings record. Since Title 2 (OASDI) is paid from a fund that is based on the contributions of workers from taxes on their wages, it is necessary to link the benefit to an earnings record in order to calculate the payment.

TLDR: Title 2 and Title 16 are very different programs with a few key similarities that really confuse people. It doesn't help that they have almost identical initialisms: SSI for Supplemental Security Income and SSDI for Social Security Disability Insurance. I avoid using the term SSDI because it just seems to add a layer of confusion, so I like to stick with Social Security Disability and SSI.",,,1,0,0,

0e9d79e8-5aca-4818-bea0-3d5f99e27e56,1534274852,"This helped me:

-Only use table lamps in the evening (with shades), no overhead lights. 

-Put a red light bulb in your bedside lamp (I think I got that one from Reddit, because I remember some dude saying, “And you’ll look better naked, too”—it’s true!)

-Consider getting amber lenses glasses for evening. You’ll look like Kim Jong Il, but they really help.

-Get out in the sun in the morning. I stand barefoot in the backyard with no sunglasses or sunscreen (except in my face because vanity) and expos d arms and legs for about 15 minutes when weather allows. It really helps reset your circadian rhythm. I am a hardcore night owl, and have been my entire life. This step has made it way easier to adjust to a normal schedule. 

And, most important:

STOP LOOKING AT YOUR PHONE BEFORE BEDTIME.

The non-scientific explanation: Your brain thinks the light from your phone means the sun is up and it’s time to be awake. (In fact, all of the steps above are designed to mimic the sun-up sun-down thing to make your brain fall into line.)

Meanwhile, the profit margins for major journals are huge.

If you don't publish enough papers in enough sexy journals then your career is in danger.

bbed7c45-3d31-468c-817f-07be160ce6ca,1535109995,"Yeah I'm gonna break this down for you as simply as I can.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Your claim:  ""Being disabled doesn't make you 'bad.'""
   1. My opinion:  We agree.
2. Your claim:  ""People use religious arguments to shame disabled people.""
   1. My opinion:  We agree.
3. Your absurd conditionals:  ""IF someone is cursed, THEN that person deserves to be cursed.  People don't deserved to be cursed because they're disabled; therefore, they are not cursed.""
   1. My opinion:  **Disagree with your premise**.  I can conceive of a metaphysical entity - including but not limited to a deity - that is cruel, bigoted, and goes about cursing people for all sorts of reasons.  (One source:  The Bible.  Motivation:  To win a bet.)
4. Your claim (as you outlined it):  "" 'Cursed is not the same as bad luck.  Therefore, we are not cursed; we simply have bad luck.'""
   1. My opinion  **Disagree with your inference.**  Let's roll with ""cursed is not the same as bad luck.""  K, whatever.  What do we call it when some entity imposes bad luck on some other entity?  Would the word ""curse"" be a fair word for that?  That would mean that 'curse' is not \*synonymous\* with 'bad luck,' but it also isn't mutually exclusive, yes?  Check out this sentence:  ""I hereby curse you with bad luck.""  Could a deity say that?  Yuh-huh!  Would that deity have my respect?  Nope.

Unfortunately, you are so hell bent on your entitlement to these conflations that you simply won't address the actual points of contention.  Don't believe in God?  Okay.  If I do, does that mean that I like him?  Obviously not.  Since a belief in God doesn't entail a belief that God is morally legit, theism v. atheism is irrelevant to the conditional you're asserting.

You just cannot wrap your head around the idea that a metaphysically influential entity could ""curse someone with bad luck,"" because omg, if we imagine that, we must agree that Job is a bad dude.  Even the shitty authors of Job made it pretty clear that they don't think that.  I mean, there is an actual case study in the actual Bible of all texts, and it actually flat out says that Job was a decent, cursed dude.

Has it occurred to you that in all your carping about religion, a handful of moral entrepreneur a couple of millenia ago were somehow able to make a distinction that you're unable to make here?

Sure, those people took God's side.  Whether I believe in God or not, I don't, and I think that Job's a bit of a shmuck for going groveling back to this tyrant who tortured him for no good reason.

How do I feel about the 10 lepers?  Not so great.  Seems pretty shitty to ""curse"" 10 people with leprosy, cure them, and then belittle them for not thanking you for that.

This is all lost on you though, because of your absolutely unflappable assumption that the condition of being ""cursed"" necessarily entails the condition of being ""bad,"" as opposed to persecuted.

If you don't happen to believe in divine persecution, that's a metaphysical claim, not a moral one.  Yet, here you are, presuming to disagree with me on moral grounds, getting all worked up about all the ""spam"" and such.

This is not hard.  It's one inference.  One.  Your knee-jerk conflation of metaphysical shit with ethical shit is just something you pulled out of your ass, and ironically, for someone who has such a problem with religion, *even religious people widely accept the idea that one can be cursed without placing any kind of value judgment on that person whatsoever*.

Since you obviously did not even read the single Wikipedia article that I cited as a super introductory reference to this idea that you just cannot wrap your head around, I am copying and pasting part of it here:

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Dystheists may themselves be theists or [atheists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheists), and in the case of either, concerning the nature of the God of [Abrahamic faiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religion), will assert that God is not good, and is possibly, although not necessarily, [malevolent](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/malevolent), particularly (but not exclusively) to those who do not wish to follow that faith. For example, in his [*Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinners_in_the_Hands_of_an_Angry_God) (1741), [Jonathan Edwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_(theologian)),  a devout theist, describes a God full of vengeful rage and contempt,  seemingly different from one with Christ-like omnibenevolence. Such  absence of omnibenevolence is one kind of theist counterargument to the  notion that the [problem of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil) poses any great logical challenge to theism.

​

One particular view of dystheism, an atheistic approach, is summarized by the prominent [revolutionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary) [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher) [Mikhail Bakunin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin), who wrote in [*God and the State*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_and_the_State)  that ""if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him"".  Bakunin argued that, as a ""jealous lover of human liberty, and deeming  it the absolute condition of all that we admire and respect in  humanity"", the ""idea of God"" constituted of metaphysical [oppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression) of the idea of human choice.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystheism#cite_note-3) Said argument is an inversion of [Voltaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire)'s phrase ""If God did not exist, it would be necessary for man to invent Him"".

​

Political theorist and activist [Thomas Paine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine) similarly wrote in [*The Age of Reason*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Reason),  ""Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the  cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness, with  which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent  that we called it the word of a demon, than the word of God."" He added,  ""It is a history of wickedness, that has served to corrupt and brutalize  mankind; and, for my part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest  everything that is cruel.""[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystheism#cite_note-4)  Unlike Bakunin, however, Paine's condemnation of the purported nature  of the divine from his time didn't extent to outright atheism and  disbelief in all spirituality, Paine stating that he accepted the [deistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deistic) notion of an almighty mover behind all things.",,,1,0,0,

Be prepared to be denied. Most people with valid claims are denied the initial application. Appeal it and prepare for another denial. Best chance is before the judge. Lose there and you can still go to federal court. Some of the process varies state to state. I don’t have much faith in the system, so I’m counting on my initial appeal/reconsideration being denied. For that, I wish I was in a straight-to-hearing state for the appeal. It would save me six months. 

Also, don’t be like me. I should have applied years ago. I’m now 35 and only 9 months into the application process. Just get it going. SSI doesn’t give you a as much back pay if you’re approved, but SSDI makes it a lot more worthwhile to apply ASAP.

I did finally go back and complete it, still had the same difficulties with ""mental illness"" being used to describe Autism and that causing me confusion on some questions, like the one I said previously where I don't expect mentally ill people OR NT people to have much hope of understanding me, but I got through.

A few things:

I was misdiagnosed and horribly mismedicated as a kid. Due to the wiring differences that cause autism, it is not unusual for medication to have unpredictable, atypical, and often horrific affects and side affects for people with autism. 

I specifically and purposely avoid what ""mental health care"" is accessible at my income in my location because I'm practically guarenteed to be misdiagnosed and mismedicated, and if I won't take a med I know I don't need for a condition I know I don't have (I have had a private evaluation done by a leading neuropsychologist, so I know I do not have the things they try to dx me with) and I know will make me very physically ill or extremely mentally unstable, I will lose my SSI for refusal of medical treatment, and myself, my carer, and my cats will all die. If I take the med, I may kill us all in a fit of crazy, or be entirely unable to keep up on my obligations and we all die anyway. I must be incredibly careful with medication, even non-psychiatric medication. I've gone entirely mentally unstable from migraine meds, thyroid meds, and a variety of other things that should not have caused the reactions they did, but nearly cost me my life or everything I love. 

I avoid ERs and unfamiliar medical professionals for the same reasons. I have a wonderful primary physician, who very much lets me walk in, tell him what we believe to be wrong based on my very atypical sensory processing, we talk, rule anything else out, and then we discuss which options are available and would work, and just as often as the doctor I'm the one picking the treatment. If it doesn't work, I discontinue use and book another appointment. 

We recently (over the course of a few discussions and through much research by both parties) realized I have developed hypermobility due to my issues with proprioception. He suggested a similar condition, I went home and researched for about 60 hours total over the course of a couple weeks, I came back and told him I believed he was *almost* right, and why I thought it was hypermobility (can be caused by proprioception difficulties) and not the other condition (believed to be genetic), showed him the criteria and screening tests and pointed out where I definitely exceeded the diagnostic criteria. 

I asked if he had any ideas on mobility aids and supports, he said he wasn't sure, I said how about we start with x, y, and z? I got the supports I wanted, and have been able to do more than I have in years since I got them, and now I've got a few ideas for others that might be helpful next time I'm in. 

This is entirely indicative of our overall relationship. He trusts my carer and I to make sound decisions and to have an idea of what's wrong and what might help in a way I haven't seen other doctors do. He allows me to have my carer in the room as a reasonable accommodation, despite the huge push to ban people from bringing friends, relatives, or supports of the opposite sex because of the potential for hiding abuse, allows us to speak interchangeably, if I'm semi or non verbal, my carer can speak, and I can chime in or not as needed. 

These are all things that have been major issues elsewhere and why I will only see two medical professionals, my doctor, and when I can afford $400 and $100 to bribe a ride my neuropsych. The results of seeing other doctors have universally been worse than the original problem, and in my opinion, in some cases worse than death. ",,,1,0,0,

 Sounds like a fun idea! Love that you are increasing the visibility of people with disabilities! 

 You might want to decide why your character is in a wheelchair (injury or born that way or chronic health issue - if it's the latter they may have additional symptoms) and if your character is 100% chair dependent or if they have some ability to get around using other aids eg sticks / crutches. 

Also frustratingly there are lots of places that are inaccessible in a chair and you'll need to consider that, not just stairs but anywhere the chair might be too wide or bulky to fit. If it's a manual chair give them gloves so they can push themselves and don't get cold / sore hands! 

Also something about other people's reactions could be interesting - my experience is that kids (and dogs!) are openly curious and usually friendly, most adults polite and surprisingly helpful, a few obnoxious adults talk to me like I'm an idiot or worse address questions over my head to my husband (because disabled = stupid /s) or walk or stand in front of me, which is particularly irritating because a) I don't want my legs / chair bumped and b) my eyes are at approximately butt level!!

There are a range of posts that would be allowed, and a range of posts that wouldn't be allowed under our current rules. ""This person has X"" solely as the title would get removed, for example. ""This person has X and is going to Disney world!"" might get removed, but might not. ""This person is going to Disney world!"" would not get removed. It's all about how they frame the title.

No one posts ""awww, look at this disabled person"". There's always some kind of feel-good/uplifting backstory to go along with it. If we entirely banned the topic of disabled people under rule 1, then we would be declaring that everything about disabled people is inherently sad. We'd be excluding them from the subreddit entirely. Personally, I think that's much worse.

I'm not really sure where you guys draw the line.

I'm not looking to ban disabled people, but I think a rule being in place about posts having to be cute outside of the disability would be helpful. I'm fine if it's a post about someone's pet and the person happens to be disabled, but I think it's harmful to have the disability be the focus of the post. An example of a ""bad"" post would be one I saw(/linked if you can see that) of a disabled person going to prom. In that post, the ""cuteness"" is pretty directly just him being disabled.

&gt;Are you able to see my conversation with the other mod?

Yes, all of us can see the entire thing. This is a difficult topic and I assume that most of us are unsure how to respond, myself included.

&gt;might be removed, but I linked 6(?) posts with titles like that and none of them were removed

Emphasis on might be removed. The ones you can see weren't removed. There are ones you can't see that were removed.

&gt;I'm not looking to ban disabled people

Sorry, but that's the impression that you're giving.

&gt;but I think it's harmful to have the disability be the focus of the post.

We actually agree with you here. Like I said, if the title were just ""This person has X"" then it would get removed.

Sometimes it's not entirely clear, and sometimes there is something else in the title to give it further consideration. It's very difficult to us to create a hard and fast objective rule for something as subjective as what ""sad"" means. We try very hard to thread the needle between what's sad and what's not. It's usually up to moderator discretion. Sometimes we have backroom discussions when we're unsure or something isn't clear. We're unpaid volunteers doing this in our free time.

We get thousands of posts a day, and when it's not clearly focusing on a disability, we usually err on the side of leaving up the content and allowing community discussion and education. If you see a post that you think is exploitative, feel free to leave a comment in the thread educating people about it with sources for further reading.

*To N8theGr8[M]:*

I think part of the problem is that it falls under ""sad"" content. I didn't think these posts were even reportable because to me, disabilities aren't sad, they're just my life.

I'm curious, though, if I made a post saying ""my gay/Mexican/trans/etc friend did x mundane activity"" would that also be expected to be reported as sad content?

*From N8theGr8[M]:*

It would probably get reported, but it doesn't mean we'd remove it. Like I said, it would depend on the title and the image content. I don't think there's anything sad about being gay, Mexican, or trans, but obviously the topics themselves are all controversial to one degree or another.

Both my daughters have special needs as well, so to a small degree I understand where you're coming from, but we try to be impartial and maintain objective standards. Sometimes we just prefer to let the community decide what content gets upvoted.

*To N8theGr8[M]:*

To me and countless others, there's nothing sad about being disabled either, so I don't understand why those posts should be reported as such.

The problem many of us have with that is that we're a small community that's easily talked over. A lot of us can't speak up for ourselves and those of us who can are constantly infantilized/talked down to to the point of not being taken seriously. That's why these posts are so dangerous to us. They help perpetuate a very scary way of thinking that's used to take away our voice and our independence.",,,10,0,0,

[https://www.instructables.com/howto/flax101/](https://www.instructables.com/howto/flax101/)

There are elaborate seat additions on the market for Segways, however, they are expensive. The one I built is of painted plywood; the only modification to the Segway is replacing part of the steering handle with an extension. This device is only applicable to those who can stand and walk a bit.

It is very easy to learn to ride, but it is experimental, and one needs to be careful around obstructions that can block the wheels (this is explained in the instructions). The MiniPro is about $500, which is a very good price given that it has most of the features of the larger Segways that cost $6000. In two years I have gone 200 miles.

Many of these represent the reasons why I'm wary of any single party speaking about disability matters, because after all each person can only truly represent themselves--if they can even do that. 

The one point that I will disagree with is the bit about assuming: I'd rather people assume ""normal"" and adjust accordingly than assume a disability where there may not be one, but that preference comes from my experience being more like OP's. I can understand that not receiving the support you need based on looking ""normal"" is just as frustrating as receiving undue help for looking ""special"". It's two sides of the same messed up coin, which is why I always say that it's even better to ask than to assume--but then even that presents its own slew of problems.

Even though I am wary of these types of presentations because of the danger of generalization, I do still believe they should exist, if for no other reason than to allow someone to express what they feel can't be understood. As you said, like anyone else's opinions they will probably be ignored and discredited, but there is at least some possibility that they might be exactly what someone else needs to hear.

The salon REALLY should be able to do a person's nails if they have tremors. They might be concerned about trimming cuticles, but it's NOT hard to hold a person's hand to file and paint nails. So if that's some kind of policy, hope they change it.

I can't tell you how many handicapped stalls we have over here in the US that aren't actually accessible to someone in a wheelchair. For example, doors open into the stall, without enough room for you to wheel in and then get the door closed.

I went to the zoo with one of my disability support groups and one bathroom we couldn't even get down the row of stalls to get to the last stall where the handicapped stall was. Most able bodied people had to walk sideways. There was probably only about 18"" of room.  By the time we found another rest room area and waited in line (with everyone using all the stalls, including the HC stall) and then waiting for the HC stall to become available, I barely made it in time. Some places have separate rooms, but they call it handicapped/family rooms so it's pretty much the same situation you've described. ",,,16,0,0,

First on my list is a mobile tiny home. I need to be in this area for the time being, but living in what equates to an RV means I could drift around a bit to avoid rent without the constant threat of homelessness. And, homelessness is a strong possibility for next spring if I don’t get something lined up for housing. I need something that’s easy to maintain and stay established in that also isn’t in a community living environment (has to do with my illnesses and symptom management and the sorts of spaces that allow me to only, and just barely, physically survive vs spaces where I have a chance of improving). But, I really don’t need a lot of space or stuff. Having already been homeless, living in cars and such, I know how to survive at even that level. That solution also means I can relocate to better spots when I’m in a more flexible position. My life was better, in many ways, even though I was homeless, when I woke up to the sound of the waves and being able to breathe the ocean air while parked along the pacific coast in Northern California, for example. That’s about 2,000 miles from me now, and the way things are at present, it might as well be 2,000,000. 

Then is the idea of a virtually completely self-sustaining homestead in the middle of nowhere. That’s the one I see as being the most sustainable on little or no income. Once it’s set up, the cost to keep it running would be extremely low and it would be all off grid with no need of even stuff like a propane tank. 

The goal is to get to where I need little or no income and to be able to live in a place that requires little daily maintenance. I can handle the occasional big task, but certainly not on the regular. If I could handle the big stuff on the regular, I wouldn’t be disabled. 

Also, I’ve had the thought to extend it a bit and do more of an informal communie, if I can get away with it. Like, have enough land that tiny home owners could come and live for free or nearly free too. Find a way to do for people that which we wish society was already doing.",,,2,0,0,

They help gather your medical information and update things with just phone calls.  You still have lots of paperwork but for me it was less overwhelming.  

In my opinion, it’s easier to start now applying for disability because of the long process, unless you have end stage renal disease or cancer you will most likely be denied your first application.  
Talk to your doctor(s) make sure they are aware your condition is affecting your work and you intend to apply for disability, make sure they are on your side.  The more documentation you have the better.

Also see what your work has available to you.  The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) protects your job if you need to take unpaid time off for medical reasons.  Your employer might offer short or long term disability, where you get a percentage of your pay while you are gone.  

Finally if you have to stop working, apply for state and federal help (food programs, housing programs, etc).  They are there to help.

Painful as it is, you don't actually need a reason to break up with someone and how her life develops after that is not on you - harsh as that sounds. You sound like you genuinely care about what happens to her after, I mean you guys have been together for 8 years, of course you care. 

Having said that, a couple of things stood out to me. The way you've written (apologies if I've misinterpreted) sounds like she didn't display abusive traits for the majority of your 8 year relationship and that this behaviour is new. It sounds like it may actually be possible that the change in meds is really having some sort of effect on her mood - perhaps by increasing irritability and decreasing her ability to stay in a stable/rational emotional state. I think she has given the meds 3 months and it's possible these side-effects are not going away so she really needs to see a doctor, probably a different one, and tell them that this is 100% not working for her. 

The other thing is your care-giving. Mixing an intimate relationship with the expectation of care-giving is tough. I'm sure there are people who make it work but for the most part it's a really difficult path to navigate and a huge responsibility. If she is unable to function in her daily life, which it kind of sounds like she is, then she needs to look into getting the support she needs for that. She needs to learn how to achieve whatever independence she has on her own, within the confines of her disability. I have a very severe disability and sometimes I suffer from long periods of chronic pain or fatigue. It sucks but I still have to fight for the care I need so I can get up and go to the bathroom. That's not my SO's responsibility. Just because a person is disabled and has serious limitations doesn't mean they're not responsible for taking charge of their life and independence. You are doing her a favour but you are not her employee or her care-giver and there is clearly a blurring of the lines here that is too much for you. I hope that makes sense.

If you decide you want to work on it, it's only going to work if a) she takes active steps to deal with the meds issue b) you take a step back from the care-giving and make it clear that she clearly needs more help than you are able to give and c) you set in place a time limit for how long you want to try that feels fair.",,,4,0,0,

She dropped two meds recently and I believe one was impacting her mood that we weren't so aware of before.  But she doesn't want to go on new meds, so...I don't know.

As for the care giving...I don't even know how to approach that scenario.  I've been doing this for her increasingly for years, and while part of me wonders if I'm enabling her to put off helping herself, she seems so helpless (and I don't think she's acting for me) I just can't see myself ignoring her so she helps herself.  Sometimes she needs help with every task from getting out of bed, clothing herself, using the bathroom, feeding herself...and sometimes she can mostly do all of that.  I don't even know what to do here.  I can see there being some dependency here that's feeding this, but no idea how to get rid of it.",,,2,0,0,

d83dcc69-154d-47ad-a509-470563c6a113,1535664765," u/edwardrotik mentioned you are looking for perspectives on disability and sexuality.

Looking at the theme you're wanting, there could be a lot of ground to cover, but I'll try and stay focused on the perception of disability that you mentioned to ed.

I think that the perception of disabled people as sexual beings  is difficult for not just the able bodied, but the disabled. My disability came later in life through injury, so I can't speak for those born disabled. That being said, one I of the biggest hurdles I faced in regaining my sexuality was the previous destruction of my identity.

In a span of three years I went from being strong and healthy to laying in a bed in pain. I lost the ability to work. I couldn't play with my dog. Couldn't clean up after myself. I couldn't even read a book because I just couldn't focus.

Sex was so far down the list of priorities I can't say that I even thought about it until months after I got access to reliable treatment.

The change from being a self determined adult male (known as a grown ass man in my area) to a lump of bloated flesh was not one that left room for the idea that I could ever find a partner. Why would anyone want to tie themselves to that for the long term? And it's not like someone looking for a hookup is going to deal with the hassles involved in getting the right positions, being careful to avoid injury, and all the other crap that goes with unreliable bodies.

Until I got past that, there was no possibility that someone would because I'd never encounter them.

My disability isn't visible if I'm careful and don't want it to be. If Im not on my cane, or I'm sitting comfortably, it doesn't interfere in anything. So the views of others isn't the same as it is for a visible disability. I don't have to deal with the stares or pitying condescension. I can be myself and interact with others in a way that by the time they see me hobbling around, they're past that barrier of pity, or fear.

And that's the biggest barrier on the part of others. You can't catch disability, but that fear is still there. When it isn't, the sickly pity usually is. You aren't a person, you're a disease or injury with a body.

By the time sexuality enters the picture, you've already got a heavy strike against the opportunity of finding a partner. Whatever other flaws you may have may be less glaring, but they're a darn good excuse for a person to flee.

So I had to turn it into something positive. By the time I met my now wife, I had accepted that if I ever had a partner, I could be certain it wasn't because of looks, or money, or infatuation and lust. You don't decide to go long term with a middle aged disabled guy unless it's real.

But that dread of being alone didn't fade until after I had sex for the first time with her. So much could go wrong. I couldn't do the athletic, bouncy type of sex big guys tend to get chosen for.  What if things don't work at all?  What if, what if, what if. 

What's silly is my wife is disabled too, so is not like she wasn't afraid of similar things.

It took a few months of rediscovering how to share bodies with the limitations. But sex is so much better than when I was younger and healthy. I *know* how important and powerful  that human connection is in a way that I couldn't before facing decades of pain filled solitude. It made me a better partner.

That's why the only way to really change how people think about disability and sexuality is to make it a subject open for discussion. When someone asks how does it work, you tell them. You field the silly questions and ignore the condescension until they get that aha  moment that we aren't disabilities with bodies.",,,7,0,0,

I am desperately trying to think of who you can go to. I do not know what State you live in.  

My gut is telling me if you do not have a doctor or social worker, to GO to an agency called Adult Protective Services. They are a state-mandated agency that arranges for services and support for physically and/or mentally impaired adults who are at risk of harm. You are definitely at risk. 

For the Future after you get help: There is something called Independent Living Services and Supported Living Services for people with disabilities. These agencies have staff come in and help you live safely and all that.

The resource limit is only $3,000.00 for married couples, it is $2,000.00 for an individual

Certain assets are excluded from the SSI resource calculation. [See here] (https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-resources-ussi.htm). One of those excluded assets is a car.

Monthly income does not necessarily count towards the resource limit. The resource calculation looks at how much money you have at the beginning or end of the month (I forget). So you could make a few hundred dollars during the course of the month, but it will not count against your resource limit if you end up spending it.

SSI has another method for addressing monthly income. [See here](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-income-ussi.htm). It basically reduces your monthly benefit amount by a 2-1 margin. So if you made $100.00 one month, your SSI benefit would be reduced by $50.

Eventually we decided that we weren't going to be able to get the care I needed from them and I had to start over with another doctor. 

I remember feeling so defeated. What if we go through this whole thing again and the doctor still won't help. You also start believing you are never going to get better because you aren't getting the help you need. 

For me the switch was amazing. I couldn't ask for a better doctor. We are on the same page about everything and she really likes to learn. I told her office before I came in that I had POTS and she actually read up on the condition before I came in and has done so much research since. 

It is so important that you have a positive relationship with your primary care doctor. Not everyone is going to be a good fit and that sucks and is scary, but just be honest upfront about what you are looking for.

96d24f44-58cc-4bb1-9887-b7d9d7f1b331,1533520389,"It's very, very difficult to get disability. It can take years to get approved during which time you can be financially disqualified for receiving private assistance or even just *trying* to work so you can maybe eat something, you need a ton of medical and other documentation, and if you are under 50, you have to prove you're completely incapable of any available job in the entire country even with retraining. Most people have to appeal at least once, and twice is not uncommon. Then you have to reprove it every few years (the exact number based on their opinion of your prognosis, which is very different from your actual prognosis. I have a disability that has absolutely zero chance of ever improving, and I have to reprove that, yes, I haven't gotten a brain transplant or been magically neurologically rewired every 2-3 years. If I don't have substantial medical evidence that I haven't been magically cured of something incurable, I will be assumed to have been magically cured and rejected) 

If she's on disability, she's simply not capable of working enough to earn any sort of livable income. 

The thing with epilepsy is you are ok, until you aren't, and while there are things you can do to reduce seizure occurance (avoiding your triggers, which can include things people don't mention as often as lights, like temperature and stress) there's no universal way to entirely prevent them, and very little advance notice/few good ways of predicting an oncoming seizure. An ounce of prevention, and all that, it may be essential to her health to spend a good amount of time around the house. It may be exactly *why* she's capable of appearing able to you. 

Also, she may require very expensive seizure meds or other ongoing care she'd be unable to afford with employment, and be qualified for medicaid or medicare solely on the basis of receiving disability. If she were disqualified, she would no longer qualify for medicaid or medicare and lose the coverage she needs to remain alive and capable of appearing able to you.  

None of that really matters, what matters is can they pay what ya'll agreed upon or not. If they're making their share, how they make their share is irrelevant. If you are doing weekly or bi-weekly payments, perhaps she needs to pay what she is able out of her disability once a month, and then he pays the difference on schedule, or some other more agreeable arrangement, but if they are attempting to live beyond their means and not able to pay what you asked, it isn't your obligation as  to accommodate that, disability or not. 

If, however, you mean ""struggling"" as in they can't afford everything you think is necessary after paying you, that's pretty typical for people on disability and not any of your business, honestly, unless they're expecting you to feed them when they can't afford it or some shit. Disability is simply not enough to meet the standards some people think of as basic needs and comforts. 

Your rent is never going to be the 30% of your income they say it ought to be, and you're never going to be affording everything you need, let alone everything you want, but if you can budget to meet major needs like rent, bills, and enough food to remain alive, then you are doing alright comparatively.

When I broke my foot and lived on the second floor, I didn't leave much. Being visually impaired, wheels that moved quickly were not an option. For long flights of stairs the ass is a great boon, as I'm sure you're aware. Hopping also didn't work well, as the unbroken foot spent quite a while swollen, had issues. 

I'm sure what I did looked absolutely ridiculous and was difficult and strenuous, but it did work. Instead of using my good leg to hold my weight on stairs and hop, I put my weight on my lower arm and lower chest by going up the stairs *entirely* sideways. You'd also need enough room for your head and neck and upper chest to hang over the railing. This will also tire your good leg right out, even though it may only be four stairs, because you'll be adjusting your weight 'on the fly' from your upper body to your lower leg in a quick manner when you hop.

e038a184-d3ea-496f-9f65-20567dafebfe,1534219148,"First thing - did you ask for a referral to the wheelchair clinic? If not, do. Doctors vary with how much they know about chairs and what level of mobility they expect of you. Make it clear you want to keep your mobility with a manual chair and that you want support with that. 

If you are going for used look at a model with full adjustability, with TiLite I think that's the AeroZ or ZRA (corrections welcomed, not familiar with Tilite). Seat width and depth are fine but there are other factors that are very much NOT adjustable and these can be a big deal depending on your illness/injury. It depends a lot on the style of chair. For example your axle placement, camber, footplate height, front frame angle, back angle, back height, level of bucket are/can be fixed in a lightweight manual and often are for experienced users.

Also bear in mind that chairs have a shelf life and that shelf life differs depending on how the individual has used their chair. If you know anyone who is an experienced chair user take them with you. Some of my chairs have technically still functioned but were *well* past their best and I would not have put another user in them. Other people will not be so scrupulous and much like cars, if you're new you're not going to know what to look for. 

I don't know what your options are with your script but I'd heavily recommend getting a new chair if you're going to be spending substantial amounts of time in it. Made-to-fit is really miles beyond anything else and you'll get advice on postural support that you won't buying used. ",,,2,0,0,

Here they are in the main body of the thread:

1. Dystheists may themselves be theists or [atheists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheists), and in the case of either, concerning the nature of the God of [Abrahamic faiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religion), will assert that God is not good, and is possibly, although not necessarily, [malevolent](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/malevolent), particularly (but not exclusively) to those who do not wish to follow that faith. For example, in his [*Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinners_in_the_Hands_of_an_Angry_God) (1741), [Jonathan Edwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Edwards_(theologian)),  a devout theist, describes a God full of vengeful rage and contempt,  seemingly different from one with Christ-like omnibenevolence. Such  absence of omnibenevolence is one kind of theist counterargument to the  notion that the [problem of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil) poses any great logical challenge to theism.
2. One particular view of dystheism, an atheistic approach, is summarized by the prominent [revolutionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary) [philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher) [Mikhail Bakunin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin), who wrote in [*God and the State*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_and_the_State)  that ""if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him"".  Bakunin argued that, as a ""jealous lover of human liberty, and deeming  it the absolute condition of all that we admire and respect in  humanity"", the ""idea of God"" constituted of metaphysical [oppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression) of the idea of human choice.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystheism#cite_note-3) Said argument is an inversion of [Voltaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire)'s phrase ""If God did not exist, it would be necessary for man to invent Him"".
3. Political theorist and activist [Thomas Paine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine) similarly wrote in [*The Age of Reason*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Reason),  ""Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the  cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness, with  which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent  that we called it the word of a demon, than the word of God."" He added,  ""It is a history of wickedness, that has served to corrupt and brutalize  mankind; and, for my part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest  everything that is cruel.""[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystheism#cite_note-4)  Unlike Bakunin, however, Paine's condemnation of the purported nature  of the divine from his time didn't extent to outright atheism and  disbelief in all spirituality, Paine stating that he accepted the [deistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deistic) notion of an almighty mover behind all things.",,,1,0,0,

If you have had stomach issues with the Naproxen I'd really advise against taking it at all until you have seen your new doc, though I do completely understand if you have to. I was in exactly your position about 15 years ago with another NSAID, was dismissed by my doctor, kept taking it, fucked up my stomach permanently. Whole class of useful drugs gone like that. A certain amount of damage is reversible but once you get past that point you're a tad fucked. 

There are other options, there are a class of NSAID's called 'selective COX-2 inhibitors' which are still NSAID's but without the risk of ulcers that come with more traditional drugs like Naproxen. Ask your doc and make sure to emphasise that you've had stomach pain on the Naproxen before. 

Ah this was the paragraph I got to before. Man I was absolutely hammering my keyboard I was so fucking furious at reading this the first time. Not only did a neuro remove you from an established routine apparently 'just because', they threw you cold turkey off Ropinerole (a fucking horrible drug to withdraw from) and then put you on a whacking great dose of Gabapentin...and then cold turkey again off that...

I was legitimately shouting inside my head reading this the first time. I've been on Gabapentin and while I found it very useful for pain it absolutely messed with me sense of reality until I settled. And that was me on a very slow titration. I just cannot imagine the suffering you must have been through and I want to give you the biggest, squishiest hug reading all that. I cannot in a million years imagine. That neuro needs a swift kick to the face every morning for the rest of their life because that's so far from good practice it's unreal. Thank goodness for your PCP.

I'd imagine the shot mentioned was probably an epidural steroid or similar, where a steroid is injected directly into the disk space to help reduce inflammation and reduce your immune response to that injury. They last a varying amount of time dependant on the person but my clinic does them every six months. There are also trigger point injections which are muscle focused, many small injections of an anaesthetic, steroid or botox into the affected area. That's not going to do much for your crushed discs but might help depending on your dystonia. I don't know what your long term options would be really as with osteoperosis, long term steroid use is a concern. 

Is there another pain clinic in the area you could see? Or if you had a better idea of what treatment was available, would you be willing to discuss it with your PCP and be referred back to the same one? Have you ever looked into therapies that can be used at home like a TeNS machine, these can be a great relief and are very cheap nowadays to try even if it doesn't work out for you.  

That's great that you're already aware of the manual chairs. Have you thought about trying it on a good day, rather than waiting for the day you're completely worn out and need assistance half way through? Moving as long as possible without help can still be a goal, but it doesn't need to be something you're doing 100% of the time. If you're walking from your kitchen to your bathroom that's moving unaided but in a safe environment, rather than in a supermarket where you've got a whole long way to go and the mental focus of shopping too. 

I appreciate what you're saying about your daughter, it's a lot for a kid that age to see. Having been in that situation I was also in the 'must do all the things in front of the preteen' camp which as you've discovered doesn't do either of you any favours in the long term. 

I was going to suggest a stool in the kitchen so that's a good start. I don't know how you are for cooking overall but my food processor and crockpot see a lot of use. Glad that the family handle a lot of the chores, I'm a firm believer in everyone pitching in appropriate to their age level, sick mom or not! It also means they're going to leave home with some decent life skills. My home is not immaculate either, I run a filter which helps a lot with the overall dust levels and do a quick go round with the hoover in the morning. I've hired help in at difficult points and I'll say it makes a huge difference. As well as the clean home just the psychological thought of someone coming in to take some of the burden is invaluable.  

(I also live in a cluttered home. My problem is I have too much 'stuff' ha.)

If my disability was not visible my answer would be: it depends. 

Pros to disclosing; 

 * Companies sometimes have an incentive to hire people with disabilities, or an obligation to offer an interview. In my country you can ask for a 'guaranteed interview' as long as you meet the requirements for the job. Some people dislike this form of discrimination but the fact is it's a lot harder to find and keep work with a disability and that's why these schemes exist. 

 * Accommodations. Okay you don't feel you need them now, but if you end up with an extra duty or a promotion you might in the future. Your boss is likely to be unhappy you've kept your disability private even if it hasn't affected your work. 

 * Safety. If something happens to you at work and you are carted off in an ambulance, it's useful for them to be able to give an outline of major medical issues. A historical TBI is a major medical issue. 

 * Honesty. If you've been upfront about your disability from the start you don't have to worry about hiding it from co-workers and bosses. I've kept my epilepsy quiet from people before (social group, not work) and it's hard to completely shut off things that impact your life. With other people I'd missed x major event/gained an injury/was feeling a bit off due to illness. With that group I had to evade or lie, and it was not worth it. It can come up in completely unrelated and unexpected situations. 

Cons to disclosing;

* Some people are judgemental fucks. The person hiring and firing ***should not know*** about your disability disclosure on your application, however...out here in the real world people talk. Legal or not, sometimes it happens.

* Questions in interview. You are right that they are not allowed to ask about your disability but you may get some questions skirting around the issue, asking without asking. Decide in advance how you'd like to address these and if you want to be with a company that hovers around the rules that way. Sometimes it's relevant depending on the job duties. Other times it's a 'people with disabilities are unreliable and we're trying to gauge how sick you are' attitude. I address it upfront with a two liner explaining that I have closely examined the job description and though I have some mobility restrictions, I am fully capable of all skills required. Generally does the job. 

* Issues that you have may be blamed on your disability where on others they'd be having a 'bad day' or 'issues at home'. This is harder to deal with long term as a disability is not short term and people are more likely to remember. Largely down to your boss' attitude. 


A final point. If a workplace will illegally discriminate against you for your disability, there's going to be some bleed into other company attitudes. You're going to be spending a very large amount of your week with these people. Unless it's a job you do mostly alone or a quick stop on the way to something better, that's going to have an impact on your emotional well-being. If a company discriminates and you disclose, they won't even be on your radar as you won't hear back.

Save your clothes and carry a beach towel for wet weather; I remember rain and mud was a particular horror on stairs, even discounting the slippage possibilities. Fold the mess on the underside of the towel (if you use one) in an 'inside' manner before stuffing it in a plastic bag, that way you can use it to get back inside the house, saves towels. Won't be much help in a downpour but for some light snow or rain, worked okay. Pretty sure I wouldn't rec a garbage bag on the stairs to protect your behind during nasty days; I know it seems like a good idea at the time but slippery is slippery when plastic is involved.  

Have you thought about how to get a wheelchair up the stairs?  If you're approved, definitely look into how to fold the models available up before requesting one, otherwise it could be exceedingly difficult to get it up and down the stairs, particilarly with no leverage and nothing to prop yourself up with. I used a walker at a snails pace and the roomie had to be my eyes (actually, at the time I'm certain some of the snails could've left me in their dust) but wheelchairs tend to be a mite heavier, obviously, and more bulky than a walker. Questions you should be asking yourself are ""How do I carry a wheelchair up a flight of stairs with a broken leg when there's no railing to lean on for leverage?""

The walker I could handle myself with quite a bit of practice, barring both detail and anything that I'd need to see more than a couple feet in front of me, but I think a wheelchair might cause  issues if you're not used to handling one by yourself.  I'd stick with something you can move with one hand, personally, since a ramp is not in your immediate future.

*To /r/aww:*

Hi,

I noticed there's been seemingly more and more posts about disabled people in the subreddit recently. Posts about disabled people in a subreddit for cute animals and babies are extremely patronizing, especially if the person in the post is an adult. I'll admit there's a bit of a gray area when it comes to posts about people doing nice things for disabled people, but in other posts (https://np.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/97cdjl/my_friend_duncan_qualified_for_the_2018_world/?utm_source=reddit-android), it seems the cutesy factor is simply that the person is disabled. Being disabled isn't cute and treating us as nothing more than inspirational stories to gawk at on the internet detracts from our ability to be taken seriously as people/adults. As a 21 year old woman in a wheelchair, I don't think it's fair for me or people like me to be seen on the same level as puppies simply for existing. If you would like to read a couple of other opinions on this, here is a post from r/disability -- https://np.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/95dcgb/does_anyone_else_feel_frustrated_whenever_a_story/?utm_source=reddit-android. I would love to talk to you guys more about this, if you'd like.

Thank you

Otherwise, people post what they want and we don't want to stop them. If you don't feel a post belongs in this sub, downvote it. If it breaks the rules, report it.

*To broadwayguru[M]:*

The problem is that it currently doesn't break any rules, so there's nothing to report. The question is whether or not there should be a rule against it. In the post that I linked, the only ""cute"" thing in the post was the fact that he's disabled. That's something disabled people generally aren't comfortable with.

*From broadwayguru[M]:*

I'm sorry, but we can't make customized rules for every single person, or even every single group.

*To broadwayguru[M]:*

Part of the problem is that other groups of people don't get posted there. You'd know better than I would because I'm not a mod so I don't see every single post, but I don't think I've ever seen a post about someone's black/female/Asian/gay/etc friend running a marathon or getting their nails done.

Stick around. We get posts like that on occasion. They usually end up locked because someone will see the very presence of a person of color or any kind of LGBT material as ""virtue signaling."" I've personally seen comments like ""black person; prepare for front page."" Give me a minute and I'll find examples.

Reported over 100 times and I was accused of virtue signaling for defending them against homophobic comments in the thread.

*To broadwayguru[M]:*

First post: the cute aspect was his reaction, not the fact that he's black (despite what the comments might have said) since the OP didn't even mention the fact that he's black.

Second post: the cute aspect was again their reactions and the fact that they proposed at the same time, not the fact that they were gay -- which, again, the OP didn't mention them being gay.

The difference between those posts and the ones I'm talking about is the fact that one's featuring disabled people specifically make a point of highlighting the fact that they're disabled. In the post I linked, outside of the fact that his friend had down syndrome, what was cute about that post?

*From broadwayguru[M]:*

You want to know the real point of that post? Fundraising. OP was trying to raise money for his friend to be in the Special Olympics. So no, he was not exploiting the guy, but the post still broke our rules and was pulled for that reason.

*To broadwayguru[M]:*

Which is why I reported it. Here's a few other posts that for some reason needed to highlight the fact that these people are disabled.

At this point I feel like this discussion is going nowhere and I'm not sure what you want out of it. If we ban posts of disabled people, then we'll be accused of ableism (i.e. pretending the disabled don't exist). If we don't ban them, we get accused of exploiting the disabled, as you've done. As a mod team, we can't win either way. What would you do in our situation?

*To broadwayguru[M]:*

If you get accused of ableism, you can point out that this was a concern brought up by actual disabled people who felt strongly enough about it to message you and make their own post at r/disability. It's actually seen as ableist by a lot of us to allow the kinds of posts that infantilize disabled people. Posts like ""my disabled mom has a cat"" shouldn't be any more acceptable or ""cute"" than ""my black friend has a dog"". Would a post like ""my friend took my Asian brother to prom"" be acceptable for the sub? Mentioning that we're disabled isn't necessary and adds nothing to the conversation/subreddit other than to normalize gawking at disabled people. It's less about banning disabled people and more about us not being the subject of a bunch of people fawning over us for no reason.

*From broadwayguru[M]:*

But in practice it would essentially involve singling out disabled people and banning them from being featured on the sub. I'm sorry, but I don't think there's anything we can do. As I said, we're damned if we do and damned if we don't. We're never going to agree, so this will be my final word on the matter.

They're a whole separate room, unisex, locked with a RADAR lock and not meant to be used by the general public. If you are disabled and need to use one you will have a RADAR key which allows you to unlock and use the toilet. 

Because the room is large and private and you can buy a RADAR key easily, they are often misused by jerks. I've had so many families, people getting changed for a night out, having sex, shooting up and fuck knows what else going on in those. RADAR loos in council offices for example normally have a blue lightbulb to deter drug users. The only situation I find acceptable is when parents with babies use them as the changing table is often in the disabled loo, even though this is not recommended. 

Regarding people who just 'want a bit more space'. That's nice mate but there are ten toilets in the normal block you can use. This is the *only one* I can get my wheelchair into. It's going for a piss, you don't need a throne. Get in, out and go back to whatever you were doing ffs. ",,,21,0,0,

I'd say the difference is that there are things you can try for most mental illnesses (like, one of the major issues is bipolar people not being taken seriously/treated properly). For the depression, anxiety, etc. there are so many things we can try. I have agency and hope: Maybe we can balance my brain and this won't be forever! 

MS itself, on the other hand, is incurable and currently the drugs are to slow progression, not stop it. Generally, once I lose function, it's gone forever. There's nothing I can do about it. Things are only going to get worse. Like, one focus in suicide prevention is the idea that things can change/be better. Well... for some of us, it doesn't.  There's no better. **EVER**. Even if we all had healthcare access tomorrow and society stopped being asshats about disability, we wouldn't be better.

I think for some of us in the degenerative/permanent boat, it can be difficult because we would kill for that sliver of hope, or for the ability to be able to *do* something.

People who don't walk well don't have walk further and then struggle to slide through rows of seats if they have handicapped seating available.

The reason I take detailed lists is that I had a therapist, a very nice individual, that I don't believe took my complaints of miscommunication very seriously despite that I tried to paint a broad picture of general difficulties. I'm guessing he also forgot the list of disabilities, because I suggested I mimic typing as I'm better at the written word than verbal communication - to be clear, I was using mimicry in an attempt to order my thoughts in a clearer manner.  I got nerves, it didn't make anything clearer that session, and so he spent the rest of the totality of our time together casually dismissing everything I said out of therapy. (He also ran a support group for trans people, is how there was contact outside of therapy). When I requested ideas for communication support I was referred to support for basic living, which had nothing to do with communication and the anxiety issues therein. How he described the place involved considerably more communication than was actually in evidence. I was indescribably displeased.

So now I take *detailed* lists.

For applying for disability, I usually answered that question when the pcp asks if I'm working.

\-It also helps to take detailed lists because I tend to overfocus, both face to face and in font.  Overfocusing when there's a lot on the plate means I'm more likely to forget the specifics of similar-but-distinct-in-its-own-right issues until I leave the building.

bbed7c45-3d31-468c-817f-07be160ce6ca,1533995715,"I don't really know what you mean by ""self-confidence,"" but to the extent that I do, I suspect the factors at play have less to do with disability and more to do with other stuff.For context, disability-wise:  I have EDS, PTSD, TN2, GAD, MDD, the fun secondary shit with EDS (which is like, everything), etc.

A lot of that is invisible, so I guess if you were to ask, ""How do you cope?""  My answer would be:  ""I don't,"" or, ""Very poorly.""  By and large, though, I don't really get why there would be a direct causal relationship between any particular disability and what I think you're referring to when you say ""self-confidence.""  If anything, I feel \*way older\*, and if people want to go do fun shit and stay out and such ---- well, that sucks, but my first thought isn't that I'm the worst, it's that I am Too Old For This Shit and want to go home.

Two terrible analogies for you to take or leave:

1. My college roommate was great with the ladies.  When I straight up asked him why he never experiences rejection, this was his answer (verbatim):  ""If I like someone and they don't like me back, I just assume that there's something wrong with them and then I don't like them anymore.""  Say what you will, but like, I get where he's coming from ---- if he didn't have chemistry with someone, well hell, that's that.
2. I have 8+ pretty awful tattoos, some of which are pretty conspicuous.  I do not believe in ""good"" tattoos, and actually find less trashy tattoos kind of off-putting.  If someone mean-spiritedly makes fun of one of my dumb tattoos, my first thought is, ""You are a person who thinks that dumb tattoos are shameful.  You obviously don't understand anything at all, and I am going to enjoy the fuck out the rest of this conversation for as long as you can tolerate it.""

So um --- not saying that either of those are ways to be, but like, if someone asks me how I'm doing, and I say ""same"" or ""par for the course"" or ""bad, but that's my baseline,"" or even just ""terrible"" (by far my most frequent answer).  Another answer that get a lot of play is, ""Super terrible.  I'm in a lot of pain, and I'm constantly imagining my insides rotting like the seance at the end of Beetlejuice.  My face hurts----"" etc.  When they ask again ---- same answer.

I guess everything I'm saying goes back to that very first thing ----- these disabilities demolish (or at least negatively affect) every aspect of my life --- directly, indirectly, and everything in between.  As far as \*people\* go, it really sucks to be unable to socialize or even function daily, and the feeling that all this shit is constant and invisible really sucks, and if an \*\*intimate\*\* shames me for it in some way, I'll for sure get really upset.  That said, when it comes to strangers, acquaintances, coworkers ---- I just really do not give a shit.  


I'm fine being asked about stuff, and the same shit that pisses y'all off pisses me off, too.  Just --- I see people on here ruminating about what in the world to do if someone tells them that things will get better, and like, there's an easy answer to that:  Tell that person that they're dead wrong and to fuck off (or like, you know --- sum/substance).",,,4,0,0,

I haven't had a picture taken of me in over a decade. The one time someone tried, I asked them to delete it and they did. 

My parents are still hunting me. The response to the comment that people may have PTSD and be from dangerous backgrounds and photos may put them in danger that if they happen to be in public, anyone can take a picture and post it as they please may be legally correct, but I wouldn't have expected them to be so dissmissive and callous.

Now I wonder if that's a good idea to be independent in the first place. 

I mostly deal with ignorant people, but they weren't ignorant, they were malicious.  After being informed, they were still saying awful things.

I think you're a bit confused about what the paragraph you're referencing is saying. Nondisclosure is a defense employers bring up when they are faced with a discrimination claim for failure to provide reasonable accommodations. However, it is only a valid defense if the employee failed to make a written request for reasonable accommodation (usually a document provided by the employer through HR). 

Prospective employees have no obligation to disclose their health status to potential employers - to require otherwise would be discrimination. The obligation only arises when the peroson with a disability makes a request for an accommodation, and even then there are protections for the person wherein they do not have to disclose every detail of their disability.

For instance there's this whole social anxiety and depression phase the US is going through that has me questioning people's validity of being disabled.  Especially when people are just throwing it out there like a favorite color or a drink order.  ""Yes a martini please with 3.5 olives because my OCD is just cray-cray today!""  I truly believe nobody who is truly disabled wants to show off their disability.  So I find when it's a part of an identity, stating your name directly followed by your ailments of x, y, z, it comes off a bit ridiculous and hard to take serious...especially when they're standing on two feet with no problem.  I understand the idea of being proud of your disabilities, but that rhetoric is taught too simplistically.  You should be proud of what you're capable of despite the issues connecting you to a disability, and to me that comes directly from suffering.  Suffering sounds like a scary word only used in a hostage situation, but it's the missing part of describing the struggle.  The difference between ""is that all"" and someone who is basically connected to life support on a wheelchair to me is if the disability has caused them to suffer.  If have or are suffering from something genetic, physical, or psychological, that's a disability in my book.  The problem with that loose definition is you can't just know by looking at someone, but that's how it should be.  A disability isn't a cool title or achievement that some people portray it as.  It's an intimate personal issue that you can either ride for sympathy or push through in search for some perceived normalcy.  And that normalcy is something I believe everyone disabled strives for.  Without it, people suffer.  It all boils down to almost a hippy mindset, and that is 'being disabled is a state of mind'...man.

As a full-time wheelchair user, heading to the weight room does *not* make up for sitting on your arse all day. Going from cane (support on one side, standing) to chair (full support, seated) is a very big jump. You're looking at changes to your BP, lung capacity, muscle tone, bone density (no weight bearing), skin issues and so on. 

With the given information if you are currently managing with a cane I'd suggest crutches or a rollator before a wheelchair. Crutches allow you to put weight on both sides of your body, make your disability visible and you can sit or lean whenever you reach a wall or seat. A rollator allows you to walk with minimal support when you can, walk with support on the frame when needed, and provides both a seat when you are tired and a place to carry your shopping. Both allow you far more mobility overall than a manual wheelchair. 

You are very sensible to worry about long term atrophy (muscle loss). It's not just your legs that go, any muscle capacity affected by posture is damaged by long-term wheelchair use as are the issues above. My wheelchair use is obligatory and I've lost a scary amount of lung function despite all my efforts. I have an imbalance in my upper body from always moving one way despite being fit because our bodies didn't evolve for an upper body pushing motion. There are a whole tonne of issues from long term wheelchair use that many people don't consider and it seriously concerns me when I see people who can physically move their legs changing to a wheelchair without trying the inbetween options. 

Keep moving on your legs as long as your doctors approve, even when it is difficult or part time. Ask them about different pain relief; trigger point injections, nerve blocks, TeNS machines, NMS, physiotherapy, hydrotherapy. Alternative therapies like actupuncture are also helpful for some people. 

I don't give a fuck what your parents think and neither should you. I appreciate it's hard to ignore them, even more so if you are young (you don't mention your age) but don't put their opinions above your health. DO put your doctor and PT's opinions way up high. I joke that the Spanish Inquisition is alive and well in the form of physiotherapists but most of them do an excellent job at keeping us at as high capacity as we can expect to be.

If you're using a cell phone or tablet, there's two programs I can immediately suggest looking in to. 

The first is https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/seeing-ai Microsoft's Seeing Ai is free on iOS and really fantastic for not just OCR but a lot of other visual recognition tasks. I would personally try Seeing AI first to see if it meets your needs before moving on to anything paid. You can have it read out small amounts of text live, or take pictures of documents, or open images for recognition from your phone's library or some other apps. 

The second is potentially https://knfbreader.com/ which does cost $99.99. It's been a while since I've seen it go on sale. (You can get an Enterprise license (through the NFB in the US, $99.99 for 2 devices according to their catalog) if for example you wanted to install it on your computer and phone. I'm not sure how installing/using the Enterprise license works.)

You can do stuff like import a PDF (one that's just images of scanned text,) take single pictures of text, or use it with a scanning stand to quickly recognize multi-page documents. There may be differences between the features offered on the iOS version and the pc and android. The windows version can be used with things like some document cameras and scanners as well. 

https://www.applevis.com/ has other OCR apps listed. Some of these apps (which I have not tried) might be what you're looking for. 

On PC, I personally have KNFB for windows. There’re numerous other OCR apps ranging from free and okay, to extraordinarily expensive ($1000 for OpenBook for example.) Some programs have free trials. If you have a disability that interferes with your ability to read normal print, your school or vocational rehabilitation agency might pay for what you need, or make it available for your use on their systems.",,,3,0,0,

But, in any case, I think this is a situation where logic should be used. I mean, if you are getting seats for an opening night of a huge movie (like Star Wars), no, don't be a dick and reserve the accessible spots, but if it's an afternoon show in the middle of the week, then chances are *pretty* good that no one will require those seats.

Now you're just putting the same amount of strain on *half the amount of body*. It should be a last resort. 

I really recommend you talk to your PCP/GP and/or physiotherapist before deciding on a new mobility device. Even paying for a single appointment and recommendation is miles better than nothing. For example there is a new trend in 'smart crutches' amongst certain disabilities where you rest your full weight on your forearm rather than the typical 'touch release' of the forearm with elbow crutches. This feels better in the moment but long term can be incredibly detrimental to the back and shoulders depending on your disability. 

It's such an individual thing and I appreciate how expensive healthcare appointments can be. But go in, say 'I'm looking for a mobility device to work with my current condition. My current device is not working. I cannot afford multiple appointments.' and most professionals will try their level best to work with you within those limitations. ",,,2,0,0,

They said its practical for people with disabilities. I asked regarding whether or not it fit a power chair, they basically replied with I don't know/no. And then I stated, okay, then it is not practical for me. That was the extent of the whole interaction. 

You're replying to me stating it is practical for some, that's great but that has nothing to do with me or my question regarding holding a 200 lbs chair. I'm actually pretty confident in saying it would not be practical for anyone with a large chair. But again, nothing to do with me or my chair. So I guess my question to you now is this.

What does this car being practical for some people have to do with me asking about my chair that will clearly not fit?

 I don't care if OP responds to others or not. I do care when a broad statement like ""This car is practical for people with disabilities"" is uttered when that is shown to not he true for ALL people with disabilities.

I have an IQ of 167, and am able to manually compensate enough to type and sometimes fake speech with advanced echolalia. My interoception is such I can not tell you if I am sick or hungry. My proprioception is such I shouldn't be capable of walking. I need 24/7 assistance and support for the most basic of tasks. I can't integrate my vision, I can't see and hear at the same time, I puke fromhow painful *water* is. 

Why don't you go and ask my carer how often he cries over trying to help me?

Why don't you go ask any of the nonverbal autistics who like me use AACs or typing to communicate whether it changes their functioning or if it's ok to shame us as not autistic enough because we happened to be fortunate enough to find support that helped us to bridge the communication gap in atypical ways?

Talk about ignorant aggressions. 

Edit: Severity is about severity of cognitive and sensory processing differences. Practical functionality is something else entirely that can vary radically in the same individual. Many nonverbal autistics are capable of communication via typing or AAC who would meet your definition of severe if you saw them in person, myself included.

I've nearly starved to death more than once due to my lack of ineroception, and you know what?

9ea2b703-8291-4d1f-b757-26ed56c58ff1,1533362858,"I do the same, but having no expectations is far more reasonable. When you stop expecting people to behave is when you are truly free. I'm not talking outlandish behavior in expectations, no matter how close we are to them, we aren't chimps any longer and no one will tolerate a certain amount of behavior.

To expect people to be mindful of what they see and have ingrained human response too is much to ask. You don't matter, I don't matter. You don't step on me, and I don't step on you. You will always have that mutual respect with me. And if I get to know you as a person, I will never treat you infantile unless I feel it is deserved.

But to ask a complete stranger to have personal empathy with you, is asking too much. If you have a physical disability and it's obvious, there is a certain amount of empathy ingrained to treat this person in a delicate manner. Sometimes people personalize that as treating a child, delicate empathic and caring. Yes, that marginalizes you in a certain manner, but if that behavior continues as person gets to know you, then they would be completely out of line.

But, as a whole, it's a very good sign that people would want to treat you in a delicate and empathic manner. Take solace that your plate is so full that you can pick and chose when your empathic actions can and should take place. I got no such treatment. When you aren't visibly disabled, and you can rationalize the way I can, it's  a hard sell at a glance. And to expect people to treat me in a special manner, without any sort of clue, is asking too much.

I need help with managing my life on a daily basis. I forget to take a shit somedays and wonder why my stomach has been hurting all day. I'm that disconnected from my personal self.

My life was cold hard and uncaring. I was treated as a normal child, when I was anything but. But I had parents that gave a shit and wasn't abused like I didn't matter, forced into parameters that weren't me, boxed and caged like an animals at times. Then maybe I could have better expectations of people. So, yeah, I find it hard to rationalize that people should have the magical expectation and go against the grain of what is obvious human behavior in everyday life. So you see, that how, in my shoes, your complaint might see a bit ridiculous. I know what people are like. I have seen that best and worst of humanity, and committed both acts.

Yeah, it's hard for me to rationalize personal empathy when you have so much of it. Your telling me your plate is so full that it's an insult to add more. I'm starving over here, and you're complaint is having too much. Do understand the disconnect?

Cursory glance you might mistake me for any joe blow without a care in the world. You might think I'm privileged for walking as I do, with both my legs and arms. What you don't see is an emotional scarring so deep that it has driven a wedge between myself and society in general.

And there are millions and millions of people like me and worse, yet I somehow don't have the correct take on people. Yeah, I guess. 

On the surface a vast majority might treat you a bit too kindly, but I'm almost sure that if anyone get to know you for any personal amount of time, doesn't continue to treat you that way. And if I was present, it wouldn't fly. But it's too much to ask complete strangers to be mindful in minor social interactions of no consequence. The world is too big and to large for you to matter enough get special treatment in that regards.

Take solace in those that do, they are special people. For the vast majority care for you like those bugs you kill on the way to your car. That is how I was raised, in a cold hard world of that reality. So I expect it out of you. I treat you as I expect to be treated. No expectations.",,,1,0,0,

That's a complex diagnosis to start with. Schizoaffective Disorder usually covers the bipolar part. From what I've read, it’s also misdiagnosed a lot. Maybe that's what they did to make getting SSDI a solid for you. 

Some of those medications are torture to come off of. I've gone through that myself. Everything they experimented with made things worse. Some made me suicidal so I ended up in the hospital a couple times. It seemed like no one cared that the medication made things worse or that stopping them was torture. 

Going through the process made me sick even without the medications. 

If you're getting disability you should be able to get Medicare after a certain time. I think it's 24 months. Depending on your state you might be able to get Medicaid. That should stabilize being able to see someone regular. After you get Medicare then it stays for 7 years.

There are no laws or rules about it and you really shouldn’t feel bad because it’s not like you’re an able bodied person using a chair just to get an advantage like skipping ques. Aids like wheelchairs are about quality of life not just a last resort and if that’s the way to enable you to get as much enjoyment out of the day as the rest of your family with being held back by your disability then it’s absolutely a valid choice. 

You will probably find you get some funny looks by some other members of the public if they see you getting out of the chair to stand or walk a short distance (say onto a ride or something) but that’s just because many people are sadly uneducated about disabilities and don’t understand how disabilities that effect mobility without completely paralysingly your legs work. Don’t let their ignorance effect you. I don’t know any statistics on it but I would say a pretty high proportion of wheelchair users can technically stand and/or walk to an extent but are enabled to access many areas of life (anything from any trip outside their house to only longer excursions like you) that they would otherwise not be able to do or struggle a great deal with if they didn’t have the option of a wheelchair.

Other than having them serve as a point of contact, prior to the hearing stage, is there a benefit to having an attorney that I am perhaps, unaware of?

Empathy is the ability to understand/relate to someone else's situation. That's it. No where in that definition is the requirement that they baby me when they don't even know me.

I'm sorry you were abused, but a lot of disabled people are. Unfortunately, we're easy to abuse because oftentimes we physically/verbally/financially can't help ourselves. My parents weren't the best either. That does not mean disabled people want infantilization packaged as ""empathy"". The majority of us do not. That's why you keep seeing that complaint. It is not empathy to us. It's a way to silence us. When you tell other disabled people not to complain about able bodied people patronizing us and treating us like literal children, you are silencing your own community. Able bodied people infantilizing us is effectively silencing us because *no one takes children seriously*. I'm a goddamn adult. I deserve the respect of not being treated like a child, just like I would if I could walk.

You keep saying visibly disabled people are asking for special treatment in asking not to be infantilized, but we're literally doing the opposite. The whole point is that we want to be treated normally, unless otherwise stated. Able bodied people are afforded the privilege of being treated with basic respect and disabled people should be too. That isn't too much to ask of anyone. And just like with any other social issue, I will continue to ask that of people until I no longer have to.

This isn't about me or you. I know we don't matter in the grand scheme if things. This is about how an entire community of people is treated by society, so your r/im14andthisisdeep logic of ""nothing matters, man"" will never apply here. Nothing you say to try to justify your disability or how you've personally been treated will change the fact that the majority of disabled people who can speak for themselves do not like being infantilized.",,,4,0,0,

Oh holy fuck. Please talk to me. I am going through this almost to the letter. Physically disabled, was put on cymbalta and it's been destroying my relationships. I'm not the same person I was. I'm more combative and do crazy things. Trying to wean off it made me very suicidal for one frightening weekend.

I see a therapist regularly now, sometimes twice a week, and I swear to god she's the only thing between me and fucking up my entire life. I'm getting a psychopharmacologist to help me with the tapering process because I handle withdrawal so badly.

Is your gf seeing a therapist? Has she thought about it? Therapy and med adjustments are the only solutions here, not anything you can do or should be responsible for. You may also wish to see a therapist and in fact I highly recommend it. You're in a position of great stress and you deserve to be able to vent.

Above all I hope you can both find peace. Cymbalta is one of the worst things that's ever happened to me.

On the amazon appstore and google play store, you can get moon+ reader pro. It's been a while since I've used it, but I remember it supporting a variety of non-DRM ebook formats, text to speech, and highlighting the sentences it reads out loud. It also has a lot of visual controls. I don't think it has the option to add premium voices through the app, but that might have changed. I thought it was a great app. 

My current reading app is Voice Dream Reader on iOS, which is also on android via google play. (The Android version doesn't have as many features, I haven't tried it so I can't compare.) I like how easy importing books is (dropbox, bookshare, various other non-drm sources) the ability to buy premium voices (on iOS, not sure about android,) and the ability to fine-tune playback and the visual settings as you read. It can do stuff (highlight by word or sentence as it reads, fine-tune voice properties, change how many lines are displayed at a time, spacing, margins, etc) that make it just a lot nicer than using the built in TTS or screen reader on your phone with another app, in my opinion. 

You can see videos of both apps being used on youtube. There might be others that do the same thing, but I don't know about them. 

Also, if you are diagnosed with a disability that interferes with your ability to read standard print books (including dyslexia, vision loss, a physical disability, among others) you can often qualify for a variety of accessible book sources for free or low cost.

I had decades of evidence of a problem of some sort, but the first two appeals, they looked at the 5 minute evaluation of their psychologist where 3 minutes were wasted on him interrogating me over calling him ""sir"" and demanding to know how I knew he had been knighted (I didn't know, and I'm not 100% certain he was being honest) and if I'd known ahead of time who I was seeing and looked him up, and went by his dismissive report that I ""probably just had some anxiety, and it seemed like something I'd eventually get over"" When the neuropsych evaluated me, I had been able to handle only 3 days of college before dropping out, had never been to school for 5 consecutive days, had been in ongoing treatment since age 5, and had never held a job. According to the neuropsych, I have the most severe sensory and cognitive processing differences of any verbal autistic on record anywhere. I can not shower without assistance. I can not hear and see at the same time. I can not see in 3D. I hear only 1 out of 3 words. I find water and food so painful I simply puke and have repeatedly had incidences of severe dehydration/heat exhaustion/nearly starving to death. I frequently lose speech to stress. I go into full overload from loud noises, flashing lights, and certain tones of voice, and drop screaming to the ground, unable to see or understand speech and thrash wildly if touched. It takes me hours to make a simple meal. My proprioception is such I shouldn't be capable of walking and have utterly wrecked my joints and have developed hypermobility. They still don't want to give it to me and put me on the shortest or second shortest review each time. If you've been attending college and held a job even for just a short while with disability related terminations and frequent disability related interruptions, it's going to be a lot harder. 

You will keep your medicaid. 

There are ways to save, but there's no explicit medical savings exceptions I know of. The only ones I have heard of are the ones under programs for transitioning off disability, like ticket to work.

There are plenty of people - both disabled and not disabled - who really don't have things that they could or should be proud of, not much recourse to actually nurturing characteristics that they value, and maybe no characteristics worth valuing at all.  

I mean, People Are Different, so.

If you were to have said that being disabled doesn't necessarily prevent one from finding things to be proud of about oneself, I'd completely agree with that.  100%.  

But, when you start making sweeping statements that assume *everybody* has this or that trait or characteristic, or *everybody* can acquire this or that --- that's where I draw the line, basically.",,,1,0,0,

4a741651-7ee5-49d7-8af3-9ba0eff0a002,1533765188,"&gt; I'm very severely autistic,

No you are not. 

If you had said 'I struggle very severely with my autism' I'd have been all behind you. 110%. I'd have championed you to the end gate through any protesters and well beyond. I'd have shouted people down for you to have your say. 

But as someone who works day in, day out with *severely* autistic children...no you are fucking not. *Severely* autistic people are nonverbal, they bite, they hit, they struggle to communicate even their most basic needs and it breaks my heart trying to understand them. They could not in a million years type out the reply you just wrote, and certainly not write your post history or even verbalize it to a carer. 

Severity is measured by comparison. When you are someone who can describe your illnesses and how it affects you...while someone with *the same illness* can't even tell me when they are hungry, a *basic human survival need*, you are not on the severe end of the spectrum of that illness. Maybe you are on the severe end of the Aspergers diagnosis, but you rubbished that in your post. Are people with Aspergers not disabled enough for you?  

But I can tell you unequivocally that if you can articulate that reply above, you are NOT on the severe end of the overall Autistic spectrum and should stop pretending you are. It's an insult not only to your brothers and sisters who suffer but to their families and friends who care for them. 

Go ahead any type out angry replies about how upset you are, how in tears you are, how I'm traumatizing you. While I consistently care for children who don't have your capabilities. How about you try making some noise for those who have no ability to speak. 

Go ahead and call me whatever you like. I'll continue standing up for the children and adults with severe autism who have no voice.",,,2,0,0,
614faac8-222a-4efc-b268-5e4a35e459a6,1535566080,"I feel like this article ignores the inconvenience, stress and anger that arises when you need a disability spot and can't find one. So many places have too few spaces to start with, so drivers with legitimate disabilities are already competing with each other to find a space. Anyone who has had the experience of driving to a store or office to find that you have to turn around and leave because you can't park there knows the kind of frustration that engenders. Even with the ADA, it still feels so often like public buildings are designed to exclude us.

So it's no wonder that some of us get angry enough to confront someone who misuses those spaces. And I've gotten into the ""invisible"" disability discussion with people. When you're using a wheelchair and you can't park in a normal space, watching someone who seems to be walking just fine take the only space you can use can be crazy making, even when they have a tag. I remind myself that the real object of my anger should be the parking lot owners who haven't put in enough handicapped spaces. But that never makes me feel better.

Power chairs and manual chairs work a little differently I believe (all my experience is with manual). The gist is, when you make your reservations, there are various accessibility options to notify them of (like, have wheelchair, or can’t walk on to plane). With a manual chair, you gate check it (that means you go all the way to the door of the plane in it, and then right board, they take the chair). Power chairs might have to check them earlier. You get from your chair, to a tiny airplane chair. If you need assistance transferring, they can lift you. The employees push the dinky, tiny airport chair down the aisle of the plane to your seat. Then you get in seat. When you get to your destination, you get your chair back. With manuals, you get the back immediately at plane door and on all layovers. Not sure about power chairs.

The fact that you can stick a bag on them with easy access is invaluable according to friends who use them. Definitely ask your doctor and be prepared with pics in case they're not aware of what a rollator is! This is much more a PT's area of interest and docs are a bit hit or miss with mobility aid knowledge. If your doc is unsure you can ask to see a PT specifically or have them consult with one.

Regarding college particularly have you spoken to their disability office? If not give them a quick call or email, they can make changes for disabled students with enough notice. Mine for example ensured that all of my lectures were in accessible halls. They may also be able to help you with carrying less stuff if that would help with walking, by providing a locker near your regular classroom. 

You could consider a provided manual wheelchair indoors on bad days. They are readily available to borrow from many places and easy to push indoors on flat slick floors. Regarding strength I don't know your disability but everyone struggles with strength in a wheelchair at first. If you can build muscle it is something you gain very quickly. 

Managing a large bag for college books and shopping is much harder in a chair than a rollator and they can be more temperamental as there are more bits to break. Your chair would likely not fit properly, an active user chair is the ideal but they cost thousands for even a basic model. Standard wheelchairs are the norm for part time users but they are heavier and harder to use, you'd feel that on top of other wheelchair issues.

I hadn't been going to my doctor for long as I didn't reach out for another doctor to get help until I realized I NEEDED it. My last doctor unfortunately passed away, so there's no way to contact him.

Anyway: First off, don’t trip off the age gap. I dated a guy when I was 19 who was 23 and his concern about the age just came off as patronizing. I’m 4.5 years older than my husband and. I’ve dated men 15 years older and younger—it just isn’t that important if other boxes are checked. 

Now, about those other boxes: Just because you can’t fulfill a traditional role for her doesn’t mean you’re “useless” to her. Never underestimate the value of someone who provides emotional support, who is a cheerleader, who maybe makes you laugh, with whom you are your best self. It’s not up to YOU to decide what she needs from you. If she needs something you can’t provide, she’ll end it. But don’t make the decision for her, and don’t think that because you can’t provide something material that you’re not worth being in a relationship with. You’re checking a lot of boxes. ",,,1,0,0,

I disagree very strongly with this. You don't go into detail what kind of mental disabilities you mean, but most of the time it's ""low IQ,"" rather than people adapting to something like autism or PTSD. So... Why is it better to treat people as if they're mentally disabled without any proof they are such? Typically, being treated as having low IQ is - *not* only perceived as, mind, but truly is - very degrading and patronizing. It's often super infantilizing, as well, and that's without factoring in most people infantilize us *without* assuming low IQ. That sort of behavior being thrown around is *not* okay simply because ""most people...""; one should have proof or, at least, a reason to believe such behavior is called for beyond physical appearance or even method of communication.",,,1,0,0,
