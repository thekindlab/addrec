if you have someone else sell it and hold onto the money for you to help you out with expenses at a later date then i am pretty sure this would be considered fraud, which would probably mean permanently losing benefits if social security finds out. you could give it to them and let them keep the money as a gift though.",,,1,0,0,

1615a5c7-27fb-4efc-98cb-62762decbb4a,1569869175,"Good question.
Note: I will only comment on physical disabilities as I have limited knowledge about the workings of mental disabilities aside from ADHD.

Problem Solving:
When we have a physical disability, we face numerous barriers that stand in our way when getting from place to place or doing something else physical. These barriers can come up fairly often, and we need to find a way to get around them. This means we must problem solve to determine what the best way of getting around those barriers are. While there are able-bodied people have great problem solving abilities, our case is unique because we must solve problems like that to survive, so we get a lot of practice in doing so.

Observational Skills:
Because we have a disability, we tend to be very observant and aware of our surroundings and what could be a danger (or just a nuisance) like curbs of sidewalks or ice covered pathways. We also tend to be more observant of people and behaviours, as we rely on people being patient and accommodating to get through our day-to-day lives. This observational habit (which also could be called awareness) is something that everyone has to a degree, but those of us with disabilities rely on it even more in order to survive each day.

Greater Empathy:
This one is not necessarily the same across all people with disabilities, as there are many who have become hardened (as a result of several things). However, because we have a setback ourselves, we are generally able to emphasize more for others who experience setbacks of different kinds as well.",,,3,0,0,

Like, asthma can go into remission, chronic kidney disease can resolve with a transplant, AIDS can be driven into hiding with antiretrovirals. Lots of things can be fixed with surgery--blindness caused by cataracts, some joint problems with joint replacements, some types of back pain. I was born with congenital hip dysplasia, which resolved completely with bracing and doesn't cause any problems now. Some cases of diabetes are curable with diet. Celiac disease and PKU can be fully managed with diet. Some people with rare diseases go from ""incurable disability"" to ""curable illness"" when their disease is researched and someone finds a solution.

But while those people have those conditions, they're disabilities. Often times the solution isn't total; the celiac disease is always going to require the dietary adjustment, the kidney recipient is always going to have to take anti-rejection drugs.

Some people absolutely detest their job; they hate going to work each day and do anything to get out early. Other people just can't find the right thing for them and jump from career to career, never feeling fulfilled. For whatever reason, I was so lucky to have found the career of my dreams. I got to spend years doing it. No - I didn't get to do everything I wished by a long shot. But I found it, and I totally kicked ass in it. I left my mark, even though it was much smaller than I had hoped. When I went through the disability process, I was shocked at how careful they are. I learned that many people try to get out on disability even though they might not actually be permanently disabled. I fought hard to keep working. I left so much on the table. There were so many things I wanted to do! I still mourn the lost possibilities, but I am grateful for the life I had. I hope you find your way through today, and then tomorrow.

It's a scam, in my opinion... the Student Loan handlers *know* that the SSA almost never issues a 7+ year review letter, which is why they chose 7 years as the requirement.

This whole thing is dodgy. I get it, I've been on benefits, but you pretty much chose to ignore all the relevant laws when you did this of what you're supposed to do w/co-tenancy and the landlord.

When my boyfriend moved out, we told the landlord and asked him if I could get a roommate. We didn't tell him we broke up, only that the bf had to move to look after his gramma, which is utterly true. The landlord allowed it, but has kept his right to approve of my roommate, which involves a background check, and he is wierdly persnickety and with criteria that is based on ""vibe"" half the time. The landlord himself drew up a six month sublease for my roommate. 

It turns out, the landlord rented us a ""two bedroom"" apartment with an illegal second bedroom, which is, I think, why he is being so weird about having two individuals live in an apartment with two supposed bedrooms.

its the same issue that tends to lead to the gay character being ""visibly gay"", think flamboyant costumes, 10 tons of make up, and the most grating voice ever, working in a hairdresser's is also an option.  if you're in the UK just think of Alan Carr, and you'll know what I mean.

2a458e4e-86c0-4bf2-ada5-56c096befc37,1568824844,"It’s wonderful that you’re thinking about this. Two things that immediately spring to mind:

1. If you are involved in planning an event, whether it’s socially (like a birthday party), or for school/work (like a club meeting), try to keep access issues in mind as a normal part of the process. That doesn’t mean you will always be able to be perfectly 100% accessible, but you can, for example, include info about access when you are contacting people about your event; you can try to pick a venue that is wheelchair accessible (and has an accessible toilet!); you can label food with ingredients or allergens if that’s a concern. Don’t expect yourself to get everything right, and be open to a long-term learning process. But even *trying* and seriously working to be inclusive is already an important step, and over time it will become easier and easier.

2. You will find that sometimes, people around you will challenge others’ disabilities, although not necessarily to their faces. But some people find it hard to accept that ambulatory wheelchair users exist (i.e. people can walk but still need a wheelchair – so you might see them get up out of it!), and that people who look totally healthy might need to use an accessible toilet, or a disabled parking badge. A good way to be an ally is to help take on some of the burden of pushing back against people who question “invisible” disabilities. People who are in that position have a particularly difficult struggle in some ways, because they often feel less valid than people who are very obviously disabled (like wheelchair users), and yet they may have just as strong a need to use – for example – a special toilet. If someone you are spending time with says, to you, behind the person’s back, “THEY don’t look very ‘disabled’...” – it would be great if you can say something like “They might have an invisible condition like Crohn’s Disease, we can’t tell just by looking.” 

Of course, your safety should come first, and I’m not saying you should get into fights! But these are a few thoughts of mine on practical ally behaviours. :)",,,7,0,0,

A lot of my identity was wrapped around athletics, labor and traditional masculine activities. I had an abusive home life, so sports were a safe place to grow.

It took me a solid 10 years to rehabilitate my self esteem and accept my new disabled reality. It was very hard for me to develop my self worth when my lifestyle had to radically change due to my health problems.

The mental and behavioral toll is that I isolate and get down. Pity myself sometimes.

I am severely physically disabled and because of that was at one point severely depressed &amp; suicidal.  They sent me to their own psych doctor who wrote up a report basically saying I was not crazy,   but in terrible physical condition and very depressed about it, and in his opinion I would be considered disabled based on mental status alone (he was a psychiatrist, not a medical doctor, so he could only give an opinion on that part).  Plus six of my own specialists confirming my physical disability.  They still denied me.

So I don’t know where you’re getting this “20 year olds with anxiety” thing but it’s a myth.  Their own government doctor said I was disabled.  I had been hospitalized for suicide in the previous year. Nope.  That is not an easy status to get.

Now, on to your situation.

You need a lawyer, period.  It comes down to a lawyer simply having the key words, phrases, &amp; info to show total disability. You can afford one, the way they do it is they charge 25% of back pay  capped at $6000 max. They take it out of the disability back pay when you are awarded, so the money never passes through your hands and you don’t pay unless you win.  You can’t get through without it.

When I finally got in front of a judge, she actually apologized for having to bring me in, asked me no questions, threw out the old decision and told me she’d never seen so much evidence of a disability in her entire career.

For example when asked about your job you can say something like “I’m a part time guitar instructor” and if they ask if you have another job or why you’re part time you can state that you’re disabled if you like or you can decide that if that’s not a response that they will accept then they probably aren’t a good fit. 

For me, I felt so comfortable on my first date with my partner of two years now that I told him everything and instead of running he was really supportive and understanding. But I’ve also had situations where I really only felt comfortable saying “oh, well actually I’m disabled but that’s not really a story I wanna get into on a first date” and if they were people I was gonna have chemistry with if I wasn’t disabled then they generally accepted that quite well.

I now use a combination of wheelchair (manual, but I’m planning to get a Batec-style power attachment) and crutches.

Fib on the night before Thanksgiving, also the day after he had his life insurance checkup which he passed, but would not have since then. Anyhow, he was admitted into the hospital and didn't come home until Monday. The bill came and was over $7K. We tried to get help from Medicaid to pay it, so some young thing called me to do the application over the phone. At that point, we still had a car each and as soon as she heard that, she said we wouldn't qualify! She didn't want to know what kind of vehicles we had or how old they were. We also had two mortgages as we were trying to get into the house he was building and then selling my house. About 7-8 years later he went into a bad bout of it again. The doctor told him to go to the hospital, even though sicker than a dog, he called the business office of the hospital to tell him that he/we had no money to pay the bill, etc. When we got the bill, this time we wrote to the hospital billing office and reminded them that they had told him to come in anyhow. This time the hospital 'paid' the bill as a charity case. He is self-employed so when we were filling out the form for Medicaid this time, they wanted to know how much he made in his job. She wanted to know the gross receipts before any expenses were taken out. So if he had made $10K for the year they didn't want to know what he had netted such as $1K.  I have no clue how segments of our society can get on welfare and Medicaid at the drop of a hat. While those of us that didn't grow up in that sort of situation are totally clueless. Next year, because he has no longer the ability to do his money-making job I am feeling a bit confident that perhaps we can get him on some insurance via Obamacare that is a whole lot less than the $145/month he pays and that doesn't include his medicine co-pays. My state doesn't allow  MC for those not making enough income.

The only thing special we get is if our income is low enough for a year because I am on SSD I can apply for a tax rebate of some of our home insurance. Some years I get it and others I don't. I also used to get a license plate discount depending again on how much we make. But most of these types of benefits, you have to know about to get it.

But you are right that many programs exist to help out folks such as ourselves and others on this forum but we just don't know how to access them. I still remember at a job I had at Arby's one of the 16-year-old girls saying she was pregnant and when the other girls asked what she was going to do, she replied that she was going to go on welfare as all the   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  did!

I'm female myself, and a while ago I was dating a guy who is also a chair user.  I started saying to him, ""Doesn't it suck when people just start pushing you?""  He looked at me and said, ""That happens to you??""  I looked back at him and said, ""Wait, that *doesn't* happen to you??""  I told him that people try it at least a couple times a month; he said it had never happened to him.  We'd both been chair users for almost 20 years.

We figured that it was indeed probably a gender thing.  Especially since I have never -- NEVER -- had a woman try this with me.  It is always men who either ask me if I need a push, or try to start pushing me without asking.

Many purebreds have that problem, too, especially the more popular ones. People breed for volume, or breed for looks, and don't care whether this is a happy, healthy dog.

Not all dogs have the temperament to be service dogs. Poodle/Labrador crossbreeds might do just fine--but only if they are bred from healthy parents with no temperament issues in their bloodline. If you want to breed a service dog, you have to pay attention to that. Sure, you can go to a shelter--and many service dog agencies do--but the fact is that most shelter dogs simply can't do the work, because it takes a very specific personality and mind to be a good service dog.

I love dogs. I hate unethical breeders, puppy farms, people who just want to win the dog show and don't care that their dog has unstable hips or can't breathe properly or any number of extreme-conformation issues.

I have no personal experience with this but everything I've read is that, generally, \[yes, you can live overseas while receiving SSDI.\]([https://www.disabilitybenefitscenter.org/faq/disability-benefits-living-overseas](https://www.disabilitybenefitscenter.org/faq/disability-benefits-living-overseas)) However, this being the government, that is not the ""final"" answer. It would appear that if you were to live in North Korea or Cuba, you cannot receive your benefits there and you also are not \*eligible\* for your benefits during the months that you live there. Once you move back to any other country, your benefits will start up again and as long as you don't live in any of the following countries (and this list may not be up to date so you will want to contact your local SSA office):  Azerbaijan; Belarus; Georgia; Kazakhstan (""My name-a Borat! Very nice!""); Kyrgyzstan; Moldova; Tajikistan; Turkmenistan; Ukraine; Uzbekistan; and Vietnam, they will be able to deliver your money again (by mail or direct deposit (I would think DD would still be doable overseas but you might want to check into that as well.)) It seems the U.S. cannot or will not send payments to any of those countries, but your checks would just accrue and they would then be sent to you once you move to any other country or back to the States (besides North Korea or Cuba, however.) Honestly, I thought the Cuba embargo had been lifted but maybe I was just imagining that or maybe they changed their minds for whatever reason.

It should be noted that SSI might be/probably is different. If you are receiving benefits as a dependent, the rules are also different.

Also, it seems that you will have to \*\*fill out a review questionnaire every 1 or 2 years rather than ever 3 or 5 or 7 years. I'm not sure what that entails and I'm not sure what happens if you were to be flagged for a full medical review. You could probably send them medical records from your overseas doctor, but I would imagine that if for whatever reason they think you are better and want you to come back for a full medical review with one of their doctors, you would have to come back or face having your benefits cut off.\*\*

Check out this official \[SSA pamphlet\]([https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10137.pdf](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10137.pdf)) for a decent amount of good info on this topic. However, if it were me, I would make a visit into my local SSA office and possibly even consult a disability lawyer before moving anywhere. There doesn't seem to be an ""easy"" answer here and there are a lot of factors that can play a part in what \*your\* answer would be. Also, one last thing that should be noted is that your Medicare benefits will very likely not pay out overseas so if you are living in a country without universal health care (or one where you don't qualify for UHC) you will probably want to pay for a plan that will cover any health expenses.

Mental illnesses are very much disabilities. I've been diagnosed with more than I can count on one hand, many of them for myself personally are more debilitating than my physical disabilities and fall under abnormal psychology. If something inhibits or limits your ability to function at a certain level in daily life, it is absolutely a disability. 

I think it's especially so with something like OCD since it's (usually) a chronic issue rather than acute. The symptoms are persistent and one of the defining characteristics of OCD is that it affects you on a near if not completely daily basis. Physical disabilities are the same - my inability to stand for more than a few minutes without pain the way people without my physical illness can and my inability to perceive reality in the same way people without my mental illness can affect me just the same in that they inhibit me from doing certain things on a regular basis without some sort of assistance. One is just helped with a wheelchair, the other with antipsychotics.

There are a multitude of able bodied, mentally ill people who receive disability based benefits like SSI. Things like school accomodations whether it be an IEP/405 plan in high school to your college campuses provided help are designed both for people with physical and mental disabilities. 

The bottom line is that you're someone who experiences a set of symptoms in your life on a regular basis that require some sort of assistance, whether it be via therapy, prescriptions, or accomodations, to help you function and do things that those not affected by your symptoms would otherwise be able to do without them. No different than someone with a physical disability. Just because your symptoms are ""invisible"" doesn't mean that they don't affect your ability to navigate through life as much as someone's who are. But don't get caught up with labels either - just because someone meets the criteria of being disabled doesn't necessarily mean they want to be defined as such. My advice to you is to use whatever terminology you feel best suits what you experience in life and feel comfort in knowing that what you do use can change.

Best to you, I hope you get all of the assistance you want with your OCD and continue to better yourself for yourself.",,,4,0,0,

c3bf11b7-7709-40f9-bcac-e8a3861879b1,1567921328,"You shouldn't feel bad. Disability certainly should be portrayed more in art, and when it is, it shouldn't just be a quick reference to someone's disability, and then never brought up again. It should be prominent. For instance, I'm a huge fan of videogames, which I consider art, and one game I played had the main characters disability right in front of you for an entire level, and showed you just how powerless a disabled person can feel. 

The game is Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus, which is renowned for it's first-person, power-fantasy-like combat. Blazkowicz, the protagonist, is bound to a wheelchair (temporarily), and basically has to roll around the first level in that wheelchair, shooting Nazis and defending his friends. At one point, he's captured, and the antagonist forces him to the floor, insults him for his supposed ""weakened"" state, then promptly kills one of his closest friends, forcing him to watch, powerless to stop it.

Being disabled pretty closely to the way Blazkowicz was, that scene really resonated with me. Even though it was a pretty gruesome and messed-up scene to watch, I was still very happy that the designers managed to so accurately portray the inability and hardship that can come with disability, and I wish that there was more media out there that was in-your-face about it. Maybe not to the extreme that Wolfenstein took it, but in a nonetheless similar manner.

It's nice when we get any form of portrayal in art, but it's so much better when it's very noticeable in that art. In my opinion, anyways.",,,3,0,0,

Many are denied on 1st application and reconsideration (if your state has that, some don't) and have to go on to a hearing with an Administrative Law Judge. There is a higher chance of being approved at the hearing level than at other levels of application and appeals. It is very important to continue appealing for SSDI benefits if you cannot work anymore.  
After the first denial many people get a lawyer, your chances of getting approved with one are higher.  Disability lawyers typically do not require payment unless you win disability benefits, and then their payment is taken out of your back payment if you are awarded any. The standard rate is 25% of back payment or $6,000, whichever is less. If you do not get approved the lawyer will not get paid either. This is why disability lawyers typically only take on cases they feel would win. 
If you have no or low income and will not be able to afford insurance premiums you should apply for Medicaid and see if you qualify.  Keeping up to date medical records is important.

No. A restaurant is a public accommodation and a place of public accommodation must remove barriers when it is readily achievable to do so. Although the facility may be ""grandfathered"" according to the local building code, the ADA does not have a provision to ""grandfather"" a facility.

My best advice is to get legal aid, and to go to your doctors pretty regularly for check ins, even if there isn’t much they can do for you.

Then it talks about how able-bodied actors have played characters with disabilities and the controversies of that (instead of casting someone that actually has that disability). It touches on ableism in Hollywood on various points.

From my Instagram post:
The #documentary #cinemability does a great job of showing how #hollywood has not been very #inclusive in regards to #actors with #disabilities (I rented it on Amazon). That is why I am wearing my shirt from disabilityshirts.com

Too many TV and Movie character roles that have a disability are played by able-bodied actors, when there are talented actors with that very same disability! No one is saying we let someone who CANNOT act play a part just because of a disability, but today it is commonplace to not even consider people with disabilities as possible actors for those parts.

It is similar to how in the past white actors would play all the parts, even the non-white characters, by putting on makeup. That is just not acceptable today, and neither should the same thing be done to people with disabilities.

Personally, I've come to embrace that I think and act differently than most men. (Obviously, these are all stereotypes) but I like that I'm not so aggressive or competitive. I like that I don't necessarily need to ""prove"" myself around others. It's interesting that much of what we consider ""manly"" is just a form of social and cultural capital. I spend a lot of my time alone so I guess I don't ""need"" that type of capital (maybe).",,,8,0,0,

The metro area is about 250,000 people if you include Green Bay, Oshkosh and Appleton. I've had some good care here and have gone to Milwaukee (Medical College of Wisc) twice for specialty care. We're about 90 minutes from Madison if I want to go to the university hospital there.  I had major some surgery in the Chicago suburbs 2 years ago with a great Surgeon (it was 2.5 hrs away, my brother and his family live there, and it was a surgeon I had used before)

We moved here to be closer to family BUT also to downsize and reduce cost of living. We had lived in the Chicago area until 2000 when we moved to AZ. When deciding to return to the Midwest we knew we didn't want to go back to the Chicago area site to traffic and cost of living, but my brother and his family live there. Moving to Milwaukee (~75 min from my brother's house) wouldn't lower our cost of living.  

So take all the cost of living factors into account as well.  If you use, or want to try, CBD or medical MMJ for any of your conditions, check the legislation in each state.

fd4cac98-623d-4730-b3fa-cc1f27c4f608,1568144509,"Wow so many questions to unpack mind if I number it?

1. This issue has been happening more than a year. The first time it was happened was in August of 2018 I both legs gave out and no matter what I did I couldn’t move them or get up. 

1.2. I wasn’t taking birth control at the time of the first fall. I’ve never had an IUCD only oral. But it seems to contribute to the high levels of copper.

2. Yes, I do have warning signs. My legs feel weak and jello-y if that makes sense? I also begin to slow down by a lot and my legs start feeling like lead. I can’t tell the exact moment I’m about to fall but I know that I’m going to. It feels like my muscles lose its tone I can move but it’s very limited. I can’t stand without assistance and I can’t seem to lift my legs when it happens. (Do you think it’s nerve and muscular?)

3. I wouldn’t say that there’s emotional (or physical) factors besides that fact that I’m ashamed of this disability but I do feel some weakness when I’m stressed but but most of the time it’s not guaranteed I fall every time I’m stressed.

4. I do feel fatigued when I’m about to fall. After I sometimes get a dull headache. 

5. I do feel pain, when I hit the ground I fall either directly on my knees or when both my legs give out on either my left side or right (which doesn’t hurt as much). Sometimes I can catch myself and I just do this squat before I fall which puts a lot of pressure on my knees. After the falling episode though I get these intense cramps in my legs.

6. There has always been this numbness in my thighs like I touch them with my fingers and the sensation is dulled I can feel the fingers but not as much and I can’t feel pressure as much on my thighs.


7. It can take anywhere from 30 minutes - the next day for my legs to feel normal. sometimes I get lucky and it lasts maybe 20 minutes. 

8. It’s interesting you say that! I do have headaches constantly and for the most part I don’t black out when I fall. But I had sort of a fainting attack. I felt myself blacking out but I was awake (I felt like I was dying) and I couldn’t get up from the floor and I when I tried to I would just fall over also everything was very tuners vision. it was strange. It went away in about 10 minutes but I digress, I am known to faint. (Were you asking wether I faint in general or do I faint when I’m about to have a falling attack?)

Just because we don't seem disabled doesn't mean we aren't. Opening the minds of those who question us is very important. And if you look up the spoon theory it might help to explain to others as well.",,,6,0,0,

The Dead Sea Collection products have seriously made a difference in my daily skin health. I highly recommend it. It's not crazy expensive. I actually emailed the company after I tried some of their products and asked where I could reliably pick them up. They told me the stores in my area where it's available. The most I've paid for one of their products is $4 (plus tax). 

I use the bubble bath in the tub daily. The conditioner daily (eczema in my scalp is awful) as well as the body wash. I regularly (weekly) use the salt+mineral+oil scrub.

We're scrappy. We take situations that have no solution and make them work anyway. That's inherently worth something - find a way to apply it and build a life off it. These conditions weren't a decision we made, but life happens and we don't really get to choose another one.

The assumption that she would be playing a disabled character isn't unfair, it is the norm for characters to be played by an actor who has a specific reason for being cast and as you rightly state, oftentimes that is due to their impaiment. 

I think you hit on a good phrase with 'meaningful way' - tbh its not about whether or not you wish the actress to be more disabled, its more that you want representation of that lived reality. You want the character to be more disabled perhaps, and the actor being disabled had led you to hope that they would be. The disappointment you feel is because you were expecting a reflection that you didn't get, and that can feel like an implict invalidation of that way of living. 

Disability Studies and Performance theorists say that the idea of an 'abled role' is something that needs interrogated. But, you're right - it is new to have a character whose is both played by a disabled actor, and whose whole arc isn't disablity: both have been done, but not together. From what you describe though, this has almost gone to the opposite extreme and seems to be ignoring the disability, and that's disappointing.

I - personally - don't see your response as wrong, some people would argue that there is no 'wrong' response to a piece of art.

I get asked this question every time I see her, or get my monthly Infusion. That creates a paper trail in my medical history that SSA can use to see extend periods of intense pain. Documentation is the key. Not just pain rating, but make sure your drs (any/all of them) note down what activities are difficult or impossible for you to do. If needed keep a journal for them to include in your chart/records of symptoms. It doesn't matter what is real, it matters what you can prove. There are tests and exams to measure inflammation and pain, if you are not seeing a dr to treat this pain regularly then you should start. Social Security doesn't care about partial disability, if you are able to work enough (by their standards that is about $1200/month or more). 

In this vein, if you cannot do your normal activities without pain or taking strong pain meds, document this. 

If you decide to file, I would consult an attorney. Disability based primarily on back pain can be difficult, an the attorney can answer questions and tell you if you have a good shot. They will usually offer a free consultation and are limited by law how much they can charge. They are also paid on contingency out of any back pay you are due.

In the meantime, if you aren't already seeing a specialist for this issue, request a referral to a pain specialist or whomever your gp feels is appropriate. You can also request a referral to pt for an evaluation to see if a mobility aid or pt would be helpful. 

Sorry for the novel, but I've been there with the ""working through"" chronic pain.

I personally have dependent personality disorder, and while I'm very comfortable in defining my own group of symptoms and causes with that label, mental health as a whole is still so misunderstood and always changing that as far as I know years from now the criteria for diagnosis could be changed completely and I would no longer meet them. But that doesn't change the fact that I do experience those symptoms and that it's chronic and debilitates me, nor does it change the fact that via some Sweet Coping Skills I can learn to function at what is considered in most of society at a high level. Whether using terms like recovered or functioning or not even choosing to identify with a diagnosed mental illness because your relationship with those symptoms change or you just don't want to anymore tbh, I'm all for it. I think mental illnesses as a whole can be overly diagnosed and it's important to not get too caught up with labels lol. You make really good points and I'm super happy that you've taken the steps in your life to feel comfortable enough in your daily life to consider yourself fully rid of your previous diagnosis, that's a huge accomplishment and I'm very happy for you!!",,,2,0,0,
f4d18fa8-4341-4c9e-9b7b-df64934a1b8c,1568193192,"Thank you so much for answering all those questions, it helps us get a better idea of what you're experiencing, maybe someone experiences something similar and can share their story.

I've had my own confusing journey to diagnosis, I work in community health and have a background of nursing. So while I haven't personally experienced anything like you describe I'll give my advice based on my rudimentary understanding of health. But of course I am just a stranger on the internet so this is more about things you could ask your doctor for further information, and not actual management or diagnostic advice.

If the issue has been happening before you started birth control, then birth control is not the cause, whether the birth control is making it worse or not isn't really an issue at this stage, because it sounds like you're looking for answers as to the original cause - though if your doctor does strongly suspect your birth control is making it worse I'd still recommend looking into other birth control options for a while to see if it can make you more comfortable in terms of your symptoms.

Cramping and weakness in your legs are important symptoms to consider in understanding what's causing this, it isn't something like cataplexy, but it could be something like peripheral neuropayhy or peripheral palsy.

The fact that your legs take up to a day to feel normal makes me think this is both muscular and nervous, now the headaches may be unrelated but since your doctor was worried about MS, two other conditions I'd recommend ruling out/investigating would be Charcot Marie Tooth Disorder and Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies, these two conditions are like a localised version of MS, they don't affect the brain so a brain MRI won't reveal much, but they cause similar issues with the nerves mylein sheaths, just localised to the nerves in the legs/arms etc. A neurologist would be the specialist to ask about this.

If the headaches are related then it might be worth asking your doctor if there is enough indication to investigate ""tethered cord"", it's essentially a spinal cord issue where your nerves get ""attached"" around your tail bone instead of flowing freely. This can cause thigh weakness and the jell-o sensation, as well as headaches.

If you have a family history of autoimmune disease, Polymyositis might also be worth ruling out. It causes inflammation in the muscles and results in weakness, cramping and an inability to move the muscles. It can wax and wane (ie, flare up, then go away for a while). Milder cases may only effect one or two muscle groups, such as only noticing symptoms in the legs. 

These are things you can ask about if your doctors current treatment plans for high copper are not helping at all. And again, these are just things I'm thinking about because of my own experiences with my diagnosis, I am not a doctor and my ability to hear hoof beats and identify horses or zebras is not reliable.

But I know how stressful it can be to have embarrassing and challenging symptoms and have no idea what's causing them, sometimes having specific things to ask your doctor about can help.

Make sure you find a doctor who will listen to you, understand what your health goals are (managing symptoms vs finding the underlying causes) but who will also help explain why certain concerns or ""webmd diagnoses"" are unlikely and not worth testing for and describe things in a way you can understand.

It's ok to be undiagnosed, that's something I've had to come to terms with, that despite my lack of a label for my condition my symptoms are no less real, I don't have to be embarrassed, because it's not my fault that there is something different about my body and modern medicine can't fully help right now.",,,3,0,0,

I'm a budgeter and a planner. I wasn't always debilitated to the degree that I am now, so while I could work more, I started a very flexible, lucrative gig that would pay residual income, and purchased the smallest, cheapest house that I could, outright, so mortgage wouldn't be a concern whenever I did have to stop working. I gave in and accepted that I needed Medicare about 6 years after my doctor started suggesting that it was time. I was awarded SSDI in less than three months because of the severity that I had let things get to and how impressed everyone was with my planning and foresight.

We had to sell the home I owned outright to use the equity for my medical bills. We had the leftover liquid cash to buy the only two things needed for the new home, so I found them at 10% store cost and saved the other 90%, which has been spent on medical costs in the four years since.

I was lucky that I could work a lot until things got too bad, and I made choices that set me up in a better position when that time came. I'm not apologizing to anyone for the fact that working my ass off when I could and planning this life since I was 20 years old provided me with enough at ONE time to buy second-hand furniture.

I'm happy to help and advise anyone, but I won't continue speaking with people who want to have a pissing match over how bad we have it. We all have it bad. Every post in this thread was made from bed because I had surgery on Tuesday, and I have two more surgeries coming up in the next three months. The past several months, I have been in the hospital one week out of every three. My husband and I had rooms next to each other at one point. I just sold several things we loved to buy a refurbished iPad that I need to continue working at all.

Disabled people need to stop treating other disabled people like shit because their luck isn't quite as craptastic as yours is and because others clawed their way to a slightly better position.

I think I'm a bit lucky in having about 10 years of paperwork showing definitive proof that's what I have and how bad it is.

The narcolepsy diagnosis is still relatively new, but I have all the criteria to meet type 2, I at least have that going for me.

I spoke with an attorney this morning who will be making a house visit soon to help me fill paperwork for SSI instead of SSDI (which I don't qualify for due to not being able to work the 10 years). And until I know what to do or how quickly we can move this along, I'll apply for food stamps for the meantime.

It's definitely rough because I used to be a very active person, I had a great memory, creative (illustration), and to experience all of it slipping away, most especially art, has pressed my depression even further.

fb329841-4772-486c-a6a4-6c0284d71b52,1568688797,"Ok, so first off: there's no such thing as ""temporary"" disability benefits, at least not when it comes to government benefits. You have to have been disabled for at least 5 months before they will process your application and there has to be evidence that your disability will continue for at least a year to qualify.

Second, only the conditions for which you have official diagnoses and documentation of will be considered by anyone (private or government) reviewing your case for benefits. Your suspicions of narcolepsy won't count for anything.

Third, your at-will employer cannot fire you based on your disability/health conditions and are legally required by the ADA to make ""reasonable accommodations"" to help you maintain your health and well-being. Go to your company's HR representative (not your boss or coworkers) with documentation from your doctor citing your need for accommodations such as a fixed and regular schedule. If they refuse to make a reasonable accommodation for you and fire you as a result, you can sue.

Fourth, the Social Security Administration won't care what you can or can't do while unmedicated. In fact, they will deny your claim if you aren't making every attempt to treat your condition. If you are medicated for your documented conditions and STILL remain unable to work (for at least five months and for an expected year at minimum), you might qualify for benefits, both SSDI and SSI (if your assets are below a certain threshold).

Fifth, if you do qualify for SSDI, you are permitted to work as long as you earn less than a certain amount. That said, if you were also approved for SSI, you'd likely lose that once you started earning almost anything.

So overall, no. There are no **government** benefits (at least in the USA) that would let you take a breather from work. It's an all-or-nothing system. Best advice I can give you is to request the accommodations you're legally entitled to for the conditions you have proof of, and get an actual diagnosis for your narcolepsy so you can either a) make requests for that condition as well or b) file for disability for it if it becomes fully disabling.

Good luck!  


Edit: Also, the SSA defines disability as an inability to do ANY job, not just the job you have. In other words, they won't award you benefits just because you can't continue to work your CURRENT job. If they (and for that matter, you) think you'd be capable of doing something else with a more regular schedule, etc. then you won't qualify for benefits.",,,2,0,0,

Rentberry created somewhat of a [primer](https://rentberry.com/blog/finding-accessible-housing), along w/ resources, to assist in this area.

Apartmentguide also has an [article of helpful tips](https://www.apartmentguide.com/blog/finding-apartments-for-disabled-apartment-hunters/) on how best to seek accessible-housing.

This [site](https://accessibleproperties.net/) claims to be a repository of housing, both for rent and sale, that are accessible.

[The Arc](https://thearc.org/policy-advocacy/housing/) is an organization involved in all aspects of disability rights.  The section I linked to is their housing-related page, and I think that you might do well to reach out to them.  Also, if you read the page I linked, under the ""Our Coalition Work"" section, you'll see other entities engaged in the fight to secure accessible housing.  Always be sure to ask any group you contact for further resources.  These entities are usually partnered together w/ like-minded organizations.  Good luck!",,,5,0,0,

Disabled people barely get a chance to act as it is. Disabled characters seem most often written to be all about the disability, and you never see disabled extras either. Why wouldn't there be someone in a mobility scooter going down the street in the background? Why no wheelchair users sat in the back of a cafe? No little people in the restaurant? Crutches, walking sticks, walkers, all kept off screen like none of us even exist except to be largely 2D characters in bad films played by abled actors?


I might give the film a watch some time but I have a feeling I know what it'll be. Excuses from the ableds and frustration from the disabled. Disability on screen should be normal.

I am disabled with several invisible illnesses and even after 6 years my husband's family don't fully understand my conditions. Sometimes it  takes finding a  round about way to  explain  it. Eg one of my conditions is autonomic dysfunction.  In short the autonomic nervous system (ANS) does not work properly. This may affect the functioning of the heart, bladder, intestines, sweat glands, pupils, and blood vessels.
The way I had to explain it to my partners family  was imagine I am a car  the engine is the heart/brain. If there isn't enough water, it can overheat and stop working. You dont have enough petrol so car with crash out. Etc. It helped them understand that condition a little.

I too have trouble getting my parents to accept my conditions, though they are hereditary. My parents refuse to believe that mine is already worse. 

Maybe if your parents saw your partner on their worst day ( I know it is dreaded by your partner but it may be only way for them to understand). As for them accepting that you plan to spend the rest of your life with your partner,  in time they will just have to accept it. My now husband,  told his mum that he  didn't care if she approved of me or not. He knows what he is  getting into with my health,  and he loves me regardless. If she couldn't accept it, then she is welcome to leave his life. 

If you ever want to chat, I  am happy to.  I have many years of experience with invisible illnesses.  I've learned to adapt to certain things that  I  can't change.  Plus my husband and I try to keep very open communication regarding how we feel etc regarding care needs",,,2,0,0,

I don't want to knock group homes or anything like that, but the level of care provided here is far superior than anything else available right now. Mental health is being privatized. We're being shut down because of money, and it isn't right.

Your state and policy matter. Most LTD policies say you're disabled if you're unable to perform 80% of your normal job duties.

If your doctors expect that you won't have significant improvement within a year, you should begin applying for SSDI. Applying for SSDI is required by most LTD policies anyway.

If the lawyer is just helping you file for SSDI, they can only take 25% percent of your backpay up to $6,000 (this amount it's set by law). If you're eligible for SSDI, you'll definitely be eligible for LTD.

To be ashamed of someone because they are on disability when you they clearly benefit from your monetary gifts is not only disrespectful, but it also represents some extreme cognitive dissonance.

So, basically the ADA isn't really about civil rights as much as it's about turning us into wage slaves, like everyone else.  I can see that perspective.  I do wonder if all the language in the ADA about our ""economic potential"" wasn't there at least partially to curry favor with business interests so they would back down.

While the US economy may have expanded overall since the passage of the ADA, is that necessarily because of a surge of disabled workers?  It seems that the percentage of disabled people who are unemployed is still pretty high; do you know how that percentage may have changed, or not, since the passage of the ADA?  

I did identify heavily with the part about having the duality of ""I'm a strong person with a dis-Ability!"" and ""Please help me government, I'm weak and impaired and here's all the ways my body fails me"".  It's such a mindfuck to try and prop yourself up all the time and then have to roll over and expose your vulnerable underbelly to the institutions so they will give you services you need to survive.  

I'm curious to know how a true, grassroots disability civil rights law would be formed or codified without drawing distinctions of what constitutes disability.  I'm not saying it's not possible, I just don't know how.  Then again, while reading the paper I did have the thought, ""In the Civil Rights Act, did they draw distinctions on what constitutes 'black' or 'Jewish' or...?""  A quick skim of it tells me that no, they did not.  Interesting.  Why do people with disabilities get such strong demarcation by those who are non-disabled, yet the subjects of the Civil Rights Act did not get such treatment by ""out-group"" members?  Maybe that was the whole ""without consent"" thing you were talking about?",,,2,0,0,

Pick some fun stuff to do at the hotel while you rest so it doesn’t feel disappointing, but still like a good time, just different – save up a good show to watch, buy a new audiobook, etc. Buy your fave treats to snack on. It’s still vacation when you’re resting! Take cute loungewear for rest times. Order in! Take advantage of NYC stuff like that. 

Be really strict with yourself about basic self care stuff like nutrition, hydration, med timings, and bed time. I know it’s super annoying, and so hard to do, but keeping all of that as close to your normal as possible will at least give you the best foundation for normal-for-you functioning.

‘Over-treat’ a little – by which I mean, this isn’t the time to push through. Normally I am all in favour of not taking too many meds, trying to handle symptoms by relaxing and letting it pass, etc., but on a trip when you’re pushing yourself, you need to be more pro-active and if you’re starting to feel (e.g.) nauseous or in more pain than usual, treat it asap.",,,1,0,0,

Despite the problems you've experienced with so-called friends (if I might be so bold as to call them such) in the past, a lot of people are fine with a little weirdness and appreciate honesty and like to make new memories with people who are different. I know we've all been there as disabled people, with the unkind, uncaring, or downright rude people we try to be friends with. It's easy to think there are more bad than good when it comes to people. Sometimes it can feel like a minor inconvenience is just ""too much"" for some people to continue a friendship. But I'd say don't worry to much about the weirdness thing for now, especially when other opportunities seem to be difficult. Plus, bowling is fun, and if you can do it, that is awesome.

Other research confirms that ""the program"" means the financial institution that holds your ABLE account. So it looks like if you don't  owe taxes in that state and the state doesn't allow deductions for ABLE accounts, you don't need to file in that state.

I wrote to MA tax board to ask them directly as well, and I'll update when I hear back. 

I've searched the IRS tax codes and the only thing that I have found is that it looks like withdrawals from ABLE are counted in your gross income.

There are some organizations (such as abscent.org and https://www.falkaromatherapy.com) that have been conducting their own research and compiling their findings to help develop systems for smell training.

For example, he asked me if I shower every day and I said “yes” and my husband laughed because I don’t even come close to that but it is a knee-jerk reaction to act like I’m fine when I absolutely am not. We tend to tell the people around us that we are fine and don’t spend the time to think about what steps we take to survive, so meeting with the lawyer ahead of time was helpful in that respect. 

He didn’t do much during the heading but he told me what to expect. He said the hearings are audio-recorded and that is why it is important to ask the judge to change positions if you aren’t comfortable because if the judge says you were able to sit comfortably for an hour and you didn’t, you can appeal and the audio will show you had to move. 

I received a fully favorable decision but I think being hospitalized overnight a few weeks before my hearing helped my case just as much as being prepared for the hearing.

When I say ""recover"" I don't mean never being able to function and live fully and lifelong without being debilitated or in any way by the symptoms of a personality disorder. That's very much a thing and that's what recovery usually defines so in that sense yes it's very possible. What I mean when I say that is moreso when people treat PDs in particular as though they're acute, or something that form in late adult years. The verbiage has different meanings definition wise but I'm more equating the situation where someone insinuates that someone with a chronic mental illness from childhood can be ""cured."" PDs in themselves are chronic in that they form early and affect a person for years. So while someone with a PD themselves may vibe with the term recovered when referring to understanding how to cope with their symptoms in a healthy way etc etc, when other people say it to someone with a PD it tends to have a harsher tone if you get what I mean. It just personally makes me feel weird when someone insinuates a person can make a full recovery from abnormal chronic disorders, it feels too much like a ""well that isn't a physical disability therefore it can be 100% cured"" thing to me you feel? No disrespect to ppl with chronic mental illnesses who use the word recover, it just hits a little different and feels kinda talking-down-ish to me when coming from someone else. But again, that's more of a personal opinion, I just threw it in because a lot of people I've talked about similar things to before have felt the same way about it.

- I know as much as I feel awkward about it, nobody really cares because they're focused on their own life. I know IDGAF about someone else's zit except maybe the briefest bit of empathy cause shit can hurt, and I imagine others feeling similarly. 
- if someone *does* judge me harshly or poorly for such a little thing that's outside my control, is that really a person whose opinion I care about? Generally not. 

Of course mobility aids are much more useful than zits, but I found using that existing mental foundation gave me a jump on getting over feeling self-conscious.

For me, this is what I wanted/needed:

1) Light weight: I have to carry my chair up and down some steps, so I wanted a light weight chair. These are often known as active chairs.


2) Folding handles: I didn't want the push handles sticking out all the time, so the handles had to fold down.


3) Lowered back: I wanted a lower than usual back rest so that I could twist round more easily and access the backpack that hangs off the back of the chair.


4) Manual chair: I wanted to push myself around, so I needed a manual chair. It can be great exercise for the upper body.


5) Folding chair: I wanted a chair that could fold so that I could get it through narrow doors and into tights spaces.


6) Larger front wheels: If you're out and about on normal pavements/sidewalks then you want 5""-6"" front wheels to get over all the cracks and potholes.


7) Replaceable cushion: You'll need a cushion to sit on, but you can start with a cheap one and see how it goes - mine cost about $25.


8) Tyres: I have solid tyres due to a lot of broken glass on pavements, but others prefer lighter inflatable tyres which are said to give a smoother ride, but I'd be worried about getting a flat tyre a long way from home.


9) Better rims: I live in a hilly city so I needed firmer grips than usual so I can get enough power into the pushing. I use Surge LT grips and they're great for me.


10) No arm rests: I found I didn't need arm rests and not having them saves some weight. I do have mud guards on the wheels and they are a necessity.


Standard Features: most chairs come apart so that they can be fitted into cars. The big wheels pop on and off by means of a button on the hub. My front wheels also come off and the chair folds to give a smaller loading size. Many fixed frame chairs have a folding back to minimise carry size.

In the end, you need to have a good think about how you'll use your chair, and that should define the features you need and which ones you don't. The more customising you need, the more expensive the chair. However, my first chair fitted 80% of my needs and cost $450 and would have been fine for a few years. (I found the money for a chair costing $4000 which is a perfect fit, otherwise I'd still be using my first chair.)",,,1,0,0,

I also have narcolepsy type 2, which is a sleep disorder. I can’t do anything for like more than two hours, tops, without getting so tired I need to stop. This definitely affects how I play video games.

I love that game because it’s a super cool game but it’s so hard to play because I can get very sleepy after playing for too long but then I cannot save and quit!

Take a break then scoop litter box. Save it in a bucket for someone else to take out to the trash because that’s too much. Move clothes from washer to dryer, collect laundry to start a load then rest. Start the laundry.

Can you sit comfortably for an hour? If not, then don’t do it during your hearing. If you need to stand or move, ask the judge if that is ok. Say “I’m sorry judge but may I stand, it hurts too much to sit.” 

Have you been hospitalized? If so, explain why.

She taught while pregnant, while breastfeeding while dealing with toddlers and a drug addict husband. She dropped her 3 months old off at daycare and went to school to take care of other people's babies. More and more kids come in not knowing 1st-grade material. There aren't enough TA, Paraprofessionals, counselors, special day classes, nurses, therapists or hours in the day. There's a reason the stereotypical old teacher is bitter and mean. 

I think one of the reasons that this goes so unnoticed is that teachers, nurses, firemen and all the other professionals you mentioned are not part of our everyday lives. Even if they are, you are either very close to them and have a social dynamic to your relationship, or are detached through a professional one. I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that out of the 24 sets of parents my mom talks to, conferences, troubleshoots with, accommodates and serves though her hard work, over 90% would underestimates the amount of work she puts into teaching. Some would even claim that it isn't enough. 

You are 100% correct that we need to elect people that care about these professionals and wants to invest in them. But we don't need to wait until election season to start caring. We can start by reaching out ourselves. Getting to know our kid's teachers. Thanking our nurses. We can volunteer our time. Community service work, a classroom volunteer a batch of cookies for the local firehouse or the nurse break room. At the very, very least, we need to check our own behavior. Are we being patient?

They only care about how much you, the beneficiary, make an earned income each month.

Unfortunately, most other benefits have severe limitations on how much anybody in the household can earn, getting married can eradicate some benefits and greatly decrease others.

For example, I moved from a flat city with public transport (easy to negotiate) with a lower cost of living to an expensive rural area with lots of hills and no public transport. The lifestyle change that has gone along with it has been pretty rough.

However, while there can be good doctors in any location, your likelihood and options of finding someone who specifically works with your conditions is most likely higher in a bigger city, *especially* if the city happens to have medical school teaching hospitals. You’d also be more likely to have different specialists that deal with your condition to choose from.

After two years of messing around with some incompetent specialists in my new rural area (I’m talking medical malpractice incompetence), I got my doctor to refer me to specialists at a hospital in a major city 4 hours away. The difference in care is amazing.  In rural areas, hospitals will kind of take who they can get, but research and teaching hospitals in big cities are more competitive for jobs.",,,1,0,0,

We're propagandized to hate the poor and punch down so that the rich can live lives of luxury and excess. It's not even that taking care of everybody would even reduce their lifestyles that much. For example, Jeff Bezos* could feed and clothe every homeless child in the world and still be the richest man on earth. (and before anyone says this isn't true, JB could easily come up with $11b in liquidity if he wanted to)

Why doesn't he? I suspect that cruelty is the point. Dehumanization is the point. The fact I'm unable to work right now due to my chronic illness makes me scum. The homeless vets? Also scum. If the people comfortably surviving in this world DIDN'T see poor people as scum or objects of pity then capitalism would collapse. How can someone buy (for example) a $100k sports car to add to their collection and be aware that someone like me would have their life completely transformed for about $3000? If our positions were reversed, I simply wouldn't be able to to. I'm not saying I'd live a completely austere life, but I'd be too wracked with guilt to live the way most multi-millionaires and billionaires live. People imagine the only alternative to the capitalist hellscape we live in is 60's style soviet communism with breadlines and dull lives. Meanwhile, we produce 2x the food we need and throw most if it away while people starve. There are more empty homes than homeless people. Landfill are filled with NEW clothing and other consumer goods because giving them away would reduce the value of next years crop of goods.

The dehumanization we (the 99%) endure is a feature of capitalism. It's so extreme that the biosphere is on the verge of collapse because of it. The thing that gives me hope is that in 50 years we'll either have some form of eco-socialism or communalism that doesn't dehumanize the poor...or the rich people will be choking to death in their climate change bunkers as the 6th mass extinction unfolds.

*As an aside, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffet drive old crappy cars. They do this so they can look in the mirror and not hate themselves. It's to maintain the illusion that they're not greedy monsters. Which is weird, because if you're rich, driving a new car with modern safety features is actually an investment nobody would begrudge.

Lawyer advised filing for SSD(I)?  Said same, was probably required anyway.
I don't think they're helping with SSD.  They want to fight Anthem.
I have crap ton of documentation.  

ADA part is confusing me.  PCP is no help in that regard.

I can go  into office at max 3-4 hours a day, 2-3 days a week.  Will leave me useless for rest of day. May need a day to recover at home after each day.

I can work remote maybe 4-5 hours a day, if I have a ton of breaks, and no expectation of a consistent schedule.  Some days mornings are good, some days afternoon are good. Some, neither.

Also work has very harsh lighting.  Massive migraine 20 minutes after they turn them on.
I use to go in super early so I could get some work done before lights came on.

Would a doctor write a note or something to this effect and I take it to work?   I told doctor that work wants documentation, and she emailed my work telling them I can't work. 

 They chewed her out about sending such a note. That she should have sent it to disability along with supporting documentation.  Yet work also sent me a note a few days prior that they were terminating me if I didn't show documentation.  They did say they would email disability and ask.

 I'm very confused and PCP has no clue.

That, to my knowledge and in my experience though I cannot cite the specific regulation, would be illegal and very easy for auditors to spot. 

What’s happening when checks are held is the FI is preventing loss during the time it takes for the check to clear and for them to actually receive the money. Especially since fraudulent government benefit checks have been increasing in circulation.

I always encourage researching a FI’s policies and fees before opening an account. But, the best you can do to avoid holds on what are often much needed funds is take advantage of direct deposit. Not only does direct deposit make funds available within 1-2 business days (if even held at all), but for many disabled folks who may have difficulty getting out of the house it makes getting your money much easier! 

Also, avoid mobile or digital deposits if possible. Most FIs follow reg CC guidelines for digital checks, but they don’t have to. Digital deposits are held under much more scrutiny since the checks aren’t presented in person and are more subject to fraud.

bf251889-dfe4-4b9a-b59b-f26f3b034f9d,1569702088,"I had a similar experience in college. I was 34 when I was trying to get a BA and I hit the barrier. After the first diagnosis I was mad at the world and I wrote a paper for one of my classes that was brutal. Thankfully the professor was amazing and she asked if she could read some of it for the class. I did not realize how angry I was at the world until she read it out loud.

For me the anger never went away and I had to learn to control it and for the most part now about 7 or 8 years later I can most of the time. It still shows from time to time and I have to step back and look at the situation and say is this the best option. 

Trying to thread the needle between advocatacy and hostility is hard because the rest of the world is going to test you constantly. Knowing when you need to advocate vs when you are just picking a fight is another major challenge. 

Later in my BA I wrote a paper on people's understanding of disability and all it thought me is that even the people that are supposed to help people with disabilities do not understand the needs of this diverse and highly misunderstood population. And if that statement did not scare you it should. 

There is nothing that I can tell you that will help you other then do not be afraid to speak up for yourself. Tell people what you want clearly and do not take no for an answer. That is how I operate with regards to my disability. I get told all the time that ""we"" have never done this before. And my response is OK then last make it happen. If they push back I say I am hearing a lot of reasons why we can't do ""x"" let's start thinking of ways we could do it. 

Force the framing of the conversation so that the expectation is one that they are expected to do it. I also like to say this if they are completely shut down and unhelpful. I know this sounds hard but I bet not attempting to comply with civil rights legislation will more then likley be far worse. I save this for if they are not willing to do anything as it is a gamble. It may make your situation worse it may scare the person and get them to come up with new ideas. Just remember set the expectation that they are required to do something and if they don't there is a conciquence. 

Disability advocatacy is a balance of the carrot and the stick and knowing when to use both. It is hard to tell when you start but you get better over time. 

Also remember you are not required to accept the accommodation(s) that an institution comes up with unless it resolves all of the needs that you bring up in the disability request. I almost always say no to the first thing presented to me and push for more. 

I hope this helped. I may not be a good resource for you as many people do not like my methods but I can point at some of my accomplishments and say they must work as I have seen some success.",,,1,0,0,

If you need accommodations at school or at work, you have the right to ask for them.

I know the stereotype of ""disability"" is somebody who has a permanent, stable, visible physical impairment; but that's a stereotype that doesn't represent reality for many (most, perhaps) people with disabilities.

Disabilities can be episodic, like episodic major depression. They can go from not affecting you at all to affecting you profoundly. Many physical disabilities also involve flare-ups interspersed with periods of more typical function.

Disabilities are long-term (we don't call an episode of the flu a disability even though it is disabling), but they don't have to be inevitably life-long. Someone who has cancer probably has a disability--but if the cancer goes into remission long-term, they may no longer have a disability. That doesn't make the cancer any less of a disability while it exists.

So yeah, OCD and major depression are disabilities. They may not be permanent, nor particularly visible, but they fit the definition of disabilities even if they don't fit the stereotype.",,,11,0,0,

As for the whole work experience thing, that's only a problem if she makes it be a problem. I got my first job when I was 24. I'm 36 now and this is my second job. Admittedly a large part of that is because 2008 happened, and it took me a few years to realise I'm not going to land the kind of job I want now without some kind of postsecondary education. That's life in 2019, and that's true whether you're disabled or not. It used to be all you had to do was prove you could use a computer and bam, you were in tech support. Not anymore.

It's difficult to point to one cause and say yep, that's why most blind people can't find work. Some are just straight up lazy (I know a few). Some have other complications, whether physical or mental, that make it difficult for them to hold a job. Some, like your friend, have confidence issues and can't put themselves out there like they need to. And some can't find work simply because of employers' perception of their blindness.

You'd be surprised at how many hiring managers, HR people, or what have you, also can't possibly think of a job that can't be done without sight. Of course they wouldn't, because they've never been without sight. That's where the self-advocacy comes in. The hiring managers who want you to change their mind will listen, but if your friend's not giving them anything to listen to, they're going to move on. The ones that don't want their mind changed can safely be ignored as wastes of time. But simply put, if I'm an employer, I need you as much as you need me. I'm telling you why you should apply to come work for me, but if you're not telling me why I should hire you, I'm not going to hire you.

And POTS is often comorbid for folks with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), which you may want to look into a bit, as many people with a fibromyalgia diagnosis also have EDS. For some, both Dx (EDS and fibromyalgia) are accurate, but a few people get the fibro Dx simply because their docs are not familiar enough with EDS to recognize it. And EDS often causes random muscle weakness/spasms and joints that come apart suddenly, which can land us on the ground real quick. I've injured myself quite badly that way many times, especially on stairs; it's awful. Even worse when we have POTS too! Lots of reasons to make friends with the floor, lol. 

If POTS and/or EDS end up being responsible for your issues, there are several very informative and helpful groups on Facebook where you can learn a great deal quite quickly. Look for the biggest couple of groups and jump in. Many great resources, like research papers, the latest genetic developments, etc, so search old posts for plenty of helpful info.

When I looked at training a service dog I spent almost a year finding the right dog and turned down 5 or 6 people and was turned down 1 time by and very good breeder what did not think that I was a good fit for the dog. 

I kept track of that dog and he was right. The person that got her turned her in to a great duck hunting dog so props to him for making the right decision. 

that same breeder helped me find the dog I ended up training. And again he picked a great dog for what I was looking for. A good breeder can do this extremely well and fits the dog to the person not the person to the dog. 

The reason for this is if you have a dog that was intended for hunting as most are and all of the prey drive shows and it wants to go outside and chase and hunt they will not make a good service dog. If you have a lazy couch potato they will not make a good service dog. A good breeder can see this in the puppies development over 8 to 10 weeks and can guess surprisingly effectively at how good they will be at specific tasks.",,,3,0,0,

If you work for an employer with a pension plan, your eligibility for the pension was priced into the insurance when the underwriting was done, if the employer elected to have retirement be considered deductible under the plan. The same is true for employers who pay into FICA and who have a provision for deducting SSDI. 

Another way to think of it - if offsets for work comp, SSDI or pensions are not included into the plan, the insurance would be far more expensive due to added risk, and as a result you might not have had the coverage to begin with.

To qualify, you need to separate yourself financially as much as possible from your family.  SSI is a basic sustenance income of last resort for the elderly, blind, and disabled, and as ironic as it seems because of the pitifully low amount, the federal government has deemed you should be able to provide for yourself with it.

Could you start paying your mom a small amount of rent monthly?  Could you apply for SNAP benefits and create your own “food household” where you buy and prepare your own meals even though you live with your family?

Paperwork is your greatest ally, and at least one doctor (usually PCP) who will help you sign and fill out paperwork. An evaluation by a physical therapist on a day when you're at your worst is also important. (Disability paperwork is not geared towards illnesses that fluctuate, so you need to fill everything out as if you're answering on your worst day.)

Also having a good history of doctor appointments is really important, including diagnoses, and building up a list of medical professionals they can investigate to vouch for you. Put down every single diagnosis you have, because they are forced to look at how all impact your ability to work together, not just the ""main"" debilitating condition. It's hard if your disability isn't on the automatic acceptance list (mine wasn't) but it can be done.

Before that, I tried to keep working at my job until I literally collapsed at work and had to convince them not to call an ambulance. I then had to quit after tying loose ends, figuring I'd get whatever it was sorted out in a few months and be back at work. Hah.

Took me two years before I was able to get on SSDI, I was lucky I started working very young so despite being disabled in my early 20s I had enough work credits to qualify. My spouse supported me completely during this time. I was mostly bedridden, and had to not eat or drink while he was gone so I didn't wet the bed. Ate one meal per day for years, my teeth ended up demineralized from malnutrition. Bed sores bc I couldn't bathe myself and my spouse was busy working 10hr shifts so I went months without bathing. He also just wasn't prepared for full time caretaking on top of working full time.

If everyone is offered a comprehensive package and the Medicare premiums were eliminated, elders and disabled alike would have an effective boost in buying power. With the last of the boomers reaching retirement age, moving from CPI-W to CPI-E is a no-brainer.

I have long advocated that the Social Security system needs change to bring benefits in line with the true cost of living. It is not just Social Security that needs reform. So many of our institutions are outdated. Indeed, the Constitution itself is outdated, but who do you trust to make changes? I think Congress needs to create a list of all the problems facing the nation, prioritize and systematically address issues including revamping the entire social safety net to come in line with the needs of the people of today. Our forefathers never imagined the technological advances we have achieved, thus did not plan our laws and government for them.

I used to live in Vegas. Vegas has to reinvent itself every so often to keep tourists interested. So too does government. Not to keep us interested, but to address the needs of a changing populace. IMO the ADA needs to be more stringent to prevent it from being manipulated by businesses trying to circumvent expenses. How many of you struggle each and every day with mobility appliances bc obtaining modifications is too bogged down with red tape?

Okay, I am digressing, but I think you get the picture. If the US would keep it's collective nose out of other nations business, we wouldn't need the biggest baddest military on the planet.

I am almost fully wheelchair bound at this point in my life and also have a very long slurry of mental illnesses that debilitate me further. I adore Disneyland but I would absolutely not be able to handle it without the Disney disability pass. The second you walk into the park, go straight to the main information building (in Disneyland in CA it's City Hall, not sure about the other parks) and request the disability pass. The cast member will ask a few very non invasive questions (ie. How does standing in a line/crowd affect you? How do loud sounds affect you? What sort of accomodations do you feel you might need?). They're very good about not stepping over boundaries and they never ask for any proof or even ask what your disability is. I often go to the park with my other friends and family members who also have mental disabilities and not so much physical, but really can't handle the overstimulation of the park. This is a life saver for all of us.

Once you have the pass, it's put on your ticket and works like a fastpass but for any ride in the park. There are information kiosks spread throughout the property, and when you want to go on a ride, you request a ""wait time"" for your pass. If you wanna go on Splash Mountain but it's a two hour wait, instead of standing in line they give you a time to come back in two hours, and you then either go through the fastpass line or the exit depending on the ride. You can only get one wait time at a time, but you can stack a fastpass on top of it. So while you're waiting for your 2pm wait time to Splash Mountain at 12pm, you can get a fastpass for Indiana Jones for 3pm, and then spend your time waiting going on small dark rides with shorter lines and you've got a whole 3 hours planned out to avoid the lines.

The only downside is that non disabled people are getting smart to this. I started doing this years ago, but when I went to the park early this year, the disability lines were packed with groups of teenagers, young parents with about 5 kids in tow, and strollers as far as the eye can see. This pass is most commonly used by adults/children with sensory issues, and as someone with PTSD and autism, I'm pretty good at spotting kids who definitely don't have any problems like this. Once again a service meant to help disabled people is being taken over by non disabled people who wanna cut corners. So I recommend the pass greatly, but be forewarned it's getting worse for wear, and I think Disney is going to have to change the policies a bit soon because it's getting out of hand.",,,5,0,0,

It dropped me off as far away from the buses as possible. All the other trams got closer. The only other people on the bus we're teachers and tag alongs who has no problem with the walk. My half dead brain didn't even realize the problem until the tram had left.

This is because SS attorneys only get paid from retro/back due SS benefits. SSA sets the SS attorney fee, it's 25% of back/retro  benefits to a max of $6000

To see her estimated SSDI benefits create an account at www.ssa.gov/myaccount 

Key questions 

(1) How old is your mom?

(2) Does her employer offer Short Term Disability (STD) and/or Long Term Disability (LTD)? 

If so she MUST apply before she loses her job. 

To be eligible for SSDI requires more than just a diagnosis. It will require proof of functional limitations and restrictions. And proof of ongoing medical care. 

I'm having difficulty linking sites here, but Google the following 

""SSDI and Multiple Sclerosis Disability Secrets""

Also

Multiple sclerosis has a specific listing in Social Security's blue book (the listing of impairments that qualify for disability) under theisection for neurological disorders. Listing 11.09 is for adults

Find this by googling

It is of a crosswalk which I took on the very first day I got my first wheelchair almost 15 years ago. I was nervous to cross the street with it. I felt stared at. I felt like I'd get stranded. It currently hangs on my wall at home. The second picture is still on my phone because I took it two days ago and I'm not home at the moment. It's a picture of me visiting Machu Picchu in Peru after three flights, a van ride, a train ride, a bus ride, and getting carried up the steps by three local Peruvian men. I could tell you about all the pictures in between but trust me, there are some good ones. 

All I can tell you is that if you think having a wheelchair or any assitive device will make your life better, then you get that fucking wheelchair and cross the street. Then you cross the city. Then you cross your country. Then you go wherever the hell you want to and you leave everyone who doesn't help you live a great life behind.

Every ounce of pain and discomfort and angst you feel now can be eased by using tools to help you live a great life.

When they give out do you feel your legs becoming weak? or do you feel your joints rolling? Would you describe it more as ""the muscles loose all tone no matter how much I flex"" or ""my nerves no longer tell my legs how to leg I can't flex even if I try""

Are there any factors that link these episodes of collapse, for example are you experiencing high levels of stress, or laughter, or maybe feeling sleepy? Are you usually sitting for a long time earlier in the day? Or are you exercising right before it happens? 

Do you have any other medical issues which you consider unrelated, for example migraines, or poor sleep/fatigue, or pelvic floor dysfunction?

Do you experience any pain or a change in your sensitivity (eg: numbness, tingling) when it happens? 

How long after your legs give out does it take before you can stand again, and how long before your legs start feeling totally normal again? 

Cooper toxicity can cause collapse but it's usually associated with brown outs/fainting more so than just your legs giving out.

After proving through the Social Security Administration or your doctor that you have a TPD and the Department of Education approves your TPD, you have a 3 year probationary period where if you return to school or get a job (I think you *may* be able to get a job if you earn less than the Federal Poverty Guideline or a lower limit), you will have to repay all of the loans discharged due to TPD. 

After the 3 year probation, I’m fairly sure you cannot get Federal Student Loans. And if you can,  I can almost guarantee you that you would not receive a second TPD Discharge. 

If you finish undergrad + grad school in a timely fashion without much incidence, you are probably going to have a hard time claiming TPD unless you can demonstrate drastic decline or imminent death occurring near the end of or after completing your studies. 

Usually the general premise is if you can graduate in a timely fashion, you can probably work a job. Now that’s not always true, but that’s how the TPD Discharge program and agencies like the Social Security Administration operate.

Edit: If you think you meet the TPD Discharge requirements and you know that your income will be significantly affected for the rest of your life and thus your loans will cause a bigger undue burden for you than able/working people, then IMO, I would do the TPD for undergrad and forget about grad school.",,,2,0,0,

Having a disability requires creative solutions and a FB group on the topic is a great resource.  Ive seen many happy autistic kids at Disney parks.  Ear protection seems to work for many.  Another thing I haven’t seen mentioned is you can use your stroller as a wheelchair, effectively a safe and comfortable place apart from crowds that can be used to wait in lines or at shows.  It seems you aren’t very knowledgable about the parks but others are and have had successful trips.  Ive also found that eating a character buffet at the end of the meal block if there is no meal after is much quieter since the place empties out.

Someone said they were told if you could do well in a zombie apocalypse then you might not be disabled. This was my response to that as someone with mental illness. 

Idk. Because ADHD would theoretically be perfect in that situation and they think that’s why we have evolved to carry it. When we were sitting around the fire, ADHD was an asset since the slightest rustling on the edge of the circle of light would grab their attention and cause them to focus on it. So walking dead type situation? We would be great. We might also do some dangerous stuff like accidentally poison ourselves which is a common danger  in unmedicated ADHDers today. But we’d be good at being alert and hyper focused. But in modern society we can be heavily debilitated and disabled. I’ve read a few ADHD researchers say that ADHD is the most debilitating of all mental health illnesses within psychology. Their argument is that ADHD untreated has devastating outcomes like raising probability of being in a car crash by 40-42%, reducing life expectancy by as much as 15 years, reducing lifetime earnings, increasing suicide risk, causing secondary symptoms such as depression and anxiety, increasing risk of teen pregnancy and suicide, increasing probability of drug use and prison time, as well as leading to some of the leading causes of death in the western world (heart disease, suicide, type 2 diabetes, etc). A lot of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia will get angry about this and say that it’s completely inaccurate to say that ADHD is worse than bipolar and schizophrenia. I’m not a researcher so it’s only what I’ve read. I do have adhd and bipolar disorder and I can say with certainty that adhd would have taken my life long before bipolar ever did. How do I know? I was diagnosed with and managing bipolar disorder for several years without much improvement. It wasn’t until I got diagnosed with adhd at age 26 and received medication that my symptoms improved greatly and I was able to focus on the left over bipolar. I’m still debilitated by a lot of adhd and bipolar but medication helps me at least live a relatively quality life. I know disability is a spectrum and it’s hard to see certain things like adhd as a disability but in a lot of ways that’s what makes them so covert and difficult to live with.

It’s hard for people to understand what it’s like to have your body tell you to kill your self. For no flipping reason. Your brain just SHIFTS and suddenly all the memories of being happy are gone. You can’t access them. You start to become convinced you’ve never been happy. This always happens. It will happen again. Friends and family have to tell you that no, it has passed before and will again. Just keep fighting through the down mood and it will pass. And it does. And the sun comes out again. And you get a few months before it comes back if you’re lucky. Repeat the rest of your life. How crazy to think that your own brain makes you believe that you should die. Depression in a lot of ways feels like an auto immune disease where it attacks itself. I become very tired and everything hurts. Physical pain. They’re getting closer and closer to showing that depression may be a physical disorder. I’m hoping I will see better answers and treatments in my lifetime.",,,1,0,0,

1.) The standards for ""disability"" differ between the VA and the SSA. What qualifies as a disability for one may not necessarily qualify you for the other. Not saying you don't deserve SSDI (I certainly wouldn't know) but it's not a given just because the VA considers you disabled.

2.) You've only been disabled since April. There's a five month waiting period before the SSA will consider your case, and it takes most people YEARS to get approval for SSI/SSDI.

And the big one, 3.) Almost everyone who applies, no matter how strong their case, gets denied the first go around, and usually the second (after filing an appeal). Almost no one gets approved before they go to a hearing. I find your comment that any 20yo can get approval in 90 days with no questions asked to be a gross misrepresentation of the difficulty of approval, especially for a young person (not to mention insensitive to people who suffer from legitimate mental health issues). No one gets approval without having their life dissected under a microscope.

I am a DME supplier and make it a point of pride that I can convince some teens and young adults to get equipment when they are hesitant. Every single one has been so greatful after delivery and following up that they got it.

I tell them 2 things. 

1) less people are looking at you than you think

and this rings true for EVERYONE, we are too busy thinking about work/school/projects and our own lives to think about trivial things. When someone out of shape goes to the gym 99% of the people that see them are thinking ""you got this"" ""good for you"" ""now that's motivating""

2) own it, make a part of who you are. Get a favourite colour, put stickers on it or get a vynil that has a motivational word or what ever. Be unappolageticaly yourself. Easy to say but the equipment can be fun and when you make it your own, you take pride in it and want to have it/use it. 

While in University I broke my back and couldn't handle sitting longer than 5 minutes. I took notes standing in lecture hall. 100-250 students in each class, by mid semester everyone recognized me as the guy that stands in class. This was for the entirety of my BSc. Made getting notes and partners easy, everyone knew who I was! I would say ""hi I'm the guy that stands in class"" and people would always say yah I recognized you. Easy opener to making friends

A 3rd note, you will most likely being using it the most in your own home or a place of work or friends places where it is 100% understood why. People sing in the shower and dance in their homes but not do it outside. At the very least you will make those comfortable situations so much easier to navigate.

From my experience, asking doctors for help was a bust, and opening up to others gave me anxiety.  


I went through life feeling confused, guessing what smelled “good” or “bad,” trying to interpret a world I wasn’t 100% physically capable of processing.  


It wasn’t until years later, after gaining the insight I needed to adapt, that I came up with the idea of creating my own version of a resource. A place that pieces together the kind of information and tips I would’ve loved to have been aware of when I didn’t know much.  


This is how The Girl Who Can’t Smell was born.   


My blog is a space where anosmics can find support, laugh and relate. It’s also a place where friends and loved ones of those affected by anosmia can learn more.  


I read a quote that said, “Be who you needed when you were younger,” and now I am  working hard to become just that...

So the girl goes in for a high five. My s/o obliges. This stranger then says hi to me and pats me on the head and tousles my hair like a child or dog and walks away.

I'm convinced her whole reason for approaching us was to do exactly that. It is possible that she assumed my s/o was a carer or sibling taking me out for the day. I can't say for sure because the conversation was short and my Polish is not the greatest. But I am convinced that this woman thought since I was disabled I was also childlike and that it was okay to be treated as such. That's not the only time something like this has happened.

My biggest concern is when I'm not scheduled to be somewhere as a vendor, events that are geared towards specific disabilities are places I would love to go and meet people in the local communities outside of a sales/client environment. Coming from the Harley-Davidson world non-sales events (bike shows, bar hops, rides to the beach/coast/desert/nowhere, ""cars and coffee"" events, ect.) were the #1 places to go and get your name out in the community, and I feel like I would be seen negatively.

in terms of training, yes! with litigation and everything being such a concern in this industry me training someone isn't really allowed. However, me demonstrating how a product is used is totally acceptable. It just has to be very carefully understood that I am demonstrating, not instructing.

You know how, when training a dog, you give them a treat every time they do a trick/a good thing so that they'll do the trick/good thing more? Humans also work that way. When you have the obsessive thoughts, you presumably feel bad. You want to do the compulsion, and if you do it, you feel a little better. The thoughts are the command, the compulsion is the trick, and the reduced anxiety is the treat. Every time you act on the compulsion, you reinforce it and make the urge to do it stronger in the future. 
As an example, I hate touching dogs because they feel dirty. If I touch a dog, I feel like my hands are covered in dirt, so I wash them. Once I wash them (once or twice or 4 times) I don't feel dirty. I'm teaching myself that the way to stop feeling dirty after touching a dog is to wash my hands (a lot). The way to break the cycle is exposure therapy where you're exposed to the scary thing and can't react with the compulsion, but that takes time and should be done w a therapist. Don't blame yourself, but do seek help.
A lot of people with depression do experience suicidal thoughts, but less than 10% actually go on to commit suicide. Additionally, depression is episodic. It doesn't last forever (although things like anxiety disorders can cause feelings of depression for a longer time). 
Really though, the takeaway from all this is to seek help from a therapist. I've found DBT to be really helpful since it's v structured, but for some CBT is better.",,,1,0,0,

I wanted myself and others to see a disabled actress, playing a disabled character, doing cool things with her cool job and audiences saying, ""whoa, how interesting."" Not that there needed to be heavy focus on the disability. Just some show of a disabled character with some impairments still just living life, doing a job, being ""cool,"" whatever. So far, it appears to be a role that can just as easily be done with an abled actress playing an abled character. 

Yes, you're exactly right: I wanted a representation of a lived reality--one that she surely must deal with sometimes-- and it had nothing to do with wishing her to be more disabled, because I surely do not. 

Now I'm starting to feel like I'm too heavily invested in this at all, but there is so little representation that each time it comes up, I get quite invested for a while. 

On the other hand, it's cool that a disabled actress has been cast in an abled role and that the actress's disability is not the primary focus of her character arc. But, still... just wanted some positive representation.

I’m worried about the residents. Some people have lived their for 40+ years. They’re being forced out if their home. 

Institutions are the way of the past and unfortunately people are viewing Polk as an old institution. It used to be the stereotypical nightmare, but it’s not anymore. People don’t know that the residents are a valued part of the community. They’re active and involved in their community. They don’t know that they’re employed. People, rightly, want the residents in a community based setting, but they don’t realize that they are. That’s what the Polk Center has evolved into. 

I hope that current residents can find homes in the area and stay close with their friends that they currently live with.

I'm pretty sure this is part of why my condition had declined to the point it has. Combined with systemic issues like poor medical care and working myself to the point of sickness to just scrape by. I went from a healthy young adult who was doing school and work and had a social life to a complete shut-in due to being stuck in bed most days. 

After I moved to at least 12 different cities and towns across 4 states to avoid homelessness, I became totally isolated and there is no chance of me getting hired anywhere despite my urge to make a living for myself.

So I'm a speech language pathologist and we use something called AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) to deal with problems like this. For something like this, there are several options. I might use something called a passy Muir valve if he could tolerate it, which allows people with trachs to breath in through the valve, but when they breathe out it goes out through their mouth allowing them to voice. https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/tracheostomy/living/passey-muir_valve.html

If he couldn't tolerate that, I might use something called a switch, which is basically like a big button. You would get a device that would speak letters, pre made words, etc aloud, and he would hit his head or chew etc to activate the switch when it got to the option he wanted. Here's an example - it's a kid so he's learning how to use it and makes some mistakes but you should get the idea. 
https://youtu.be/DvFNjXpWL5g


Here's a no tech option called PODD that you could also use if you wanted to go a little faster than one letter at a time. You would do the talking and he would nod or shake his head or blink or whatever when you got to what he wanted. The categories always stay the same so he would just nod he head when you got to the one he wanted and you'd go through the categories until you got to the word he wanted.

Manliness, or masculinity, is one of the most warped concepts in society. Because men were (and still are) the ones who did most of the heavy-hitting physical work, the standard for men became associated with physical and mental strength. However, this is extremely toxic.

The toxic aspect of this concept is that men are measured by how strong they are physically and how hardened they are emotionally. Obviously, for men with physical and mental disabilities, this would deem us non-manly.

But we have so much potential in so many aspects of life because of our disabilities. Sure, we aren't able to do everything that an abled-person can, but we can also do things better than a typical abled-person (better problem solving, better observational skills, greater empathy).

So, what an I trying to tell you? Masculinity should not be a measurement that you try to score high on, because it is based on toxic attributes that don't make you a better person. Instead, strive to be the best person you can be, and you should do just fine ��",,,7,0,0,

They even say while my injuries are severe I don't have enough work history.  Even though I've worked since I was 13 and I'm 33. 

Individuals of all ages can be approved for Social Security Disability benefits (SSDI), as long as they meet certain stipulations. 

A disability claim is evaluated by the Social Security Administration (SSA) according to vocational factors and medical guidelines. 

Depending on work history and medical issues, it's possible that a person's age is a factor in determining disability, though individuals are not automatically disqualified for benefits just because they are/aren't of a certain age.

The main determining factor for approval of a SSDI claim is ability to work. If the SSA determines, after evaluating medical records and recommendations by doctors - that a person is unable to engage in any sort of gainful employment, then chances are they'll be awarded Social Security Disability benefits, regardless of age.

Have you gone through the appeals process after rejection? You wrote that you applied three times, but didn't mention any appeals. This is important because   over two million disability applications make it to the Social Security Administration on a yearly basis, and less than half of those are approved during the initial application process. The remainder are left to fight for their benefits through a disability appeal process.

Filing multiple applications isn't as effective as filing an appeal to a rejection.

&gt;My issue is I live in public housing and they won't accommodate me and say they don't have to because I'm not on social security.  My doctor even wrote them a letter stating I needed a one story apartment.  Is there anyone else going through this or can help me out. What do I do? Thank you

You do not have to be on disability benefits to qualify as disabled and be allowed to request disability accommodations in housing.

Public Housing is covered by The Fair Housing Act, which has it's own definition and understanding of disability/disabled.

“Any person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; has a record of such impairment; or is regarded as having such an impairment.”

“In general, a physical or mental impairment includes hearing, mobility and visual impairments, chronic alcoholism, chronic mental illness, AIDS, AIDS Related Complex, and mental retardation that substantially limits one or more major life activities.”

“Major life activities include walking, talking, hearing, seeing, breathing, learning, performing manual tasks, and caring for oneself.”

You do not need to “prove” to your landlord or Housing agency that you are disabled. If your doctor or provider writes that you are disabled, this is all that is needed. 

You may want to research The Fair Housing Act further to see how to word a reasonable request. If you still encounter issues, you may be able to talk to a disability rights advocate for assistance.",,,2,0,0,

So, there is some perspective here that maybe they don't know how to tell--although I would never say an abled person cannot write a good disabled story.

I also think some portrayals are good and effective sometimes, though.

EDIT: I also agree that sometimes ableds are uncomfortable at the sight of us. I don't know what you're going through or how your life has been, but I want to tell you that many ableds aren't uncomfortable and very caring or can treat you normally.

You need to apply for [PIP](https://www.gov.uk/pip/how-to-claim) ASAP. It will open a lot of doors for you. [Benefits and work](http://www.benefitsandwork.co.uk) is a fantastic resource. You have to pay for it, but it is worth every penny in my opinion. I have helped a lot of people put in PIP applications, so feel free to drop me a message if you need any help filling out the forms or preparing for your face to face.

Once you have PIP, your mother can claim [carers allowance](https://www.gov.uk/carers-allowance) as long as she isn't in work. It will also give you an entitlement to [disability premiums, council tax discount and travel support](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/benefits/sick-or-disabled-people-and-carers/pip/before-claiming/extra-help-pip-entitles-you-to/)

Apply for a blue badge [here](http://www.gov.uk/apply-blue-badge).

A [Disabled Facilities Grant](http://www.gov.uk/disabled-facilities-grants) will help you to pay for adaptations to your house so you can regain a bit of independence. 

If you want to take the strain off your mother as far as your care goes, then you will need to arrange a [needs assessment](https://www.gov.uk/apply-needs-assessment-social-services) from social services who will be able to assess what support you need and arrange it for you. They will also be able to offer you advice.

This next one is a bit difficult to provide specific resources for, as I don't know the ins and outs for your situation, but try and apply for grants to purchase yourself a powerchair. It sounds like it would give you heaps of independence. I have purchased two second hand powerchairs in the past and there are some really good companies that specialize in refurbished ones. If you can't raise the money for a new one then it is definitely a route to consider, but get yourself an assessment for a powerchair from a company. [This](https://www.solutionsmobility.co.uk/) is the company I have purchased chairs from in the past and I still use them to purchase all my parts as I work on my own chairs now. Most of them will have someone on their staff that will be able to point you in the right direction of funding. 

Also, if you are struggling to cope with all of this, then get in touch with a charity like [Ehlers-Danlos Support UK](https://www.ehlers-danlos.org/). I haven't had any personal experiences with them, but it is worth an email just to see what kind of support they might be able to offer you.

It is also probably worth having a read up about the issues surrounding [the mummy drinking culture](https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;client=ms-android-samsung-gn-rev1&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNS9RJeA2LLOVUhnY_3Ifu68pzzQFw%3A1569486084625&amp;ei=BHWMXYXjJaCPhbIPrfOUkAc&amp;q=mummy+drinking+culture&amp;oq=mummy+drinking+culture&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-serp.3..0.104844.105336..106513...0.1..0.79.141.2......0....1.........0i71j35i304i39j0i13i30j0i13i5i30j33i21.5SX1ElZjLmo) so you might be able to better understand how social media and society in general is affecting your mother's view on her drinking.

4aa016a1-dc3d-4bde-9e6b-fb8566588993,1567450960,"That is why I said *documentation* is important. Chronic pain becomes disabling when it is chronic enough and at a high enough intensity to interfere with daily activities needed for life, like making or eating meals, hygiene, or even walking to the bathroom. 

For example I live life at a 3-4 most days. There are (many) days where the pain increases to a 6+ when I do something like make dinner or drive to the grocery store. There are some days where that baseline pain is 6+, or that I can't do more than stagger to the bathroom and back to bed. I could ""work through"" the pain, but that required copious pain meds, to the point that I wouldn't have been safe to drive home. It would also compound daily, so 1 moderately ""bad"" day would trigger a bad week or more if I worked through the pain. 

Childbirth on the other hand causes intense but temporary pain. Sure temporary may mean several weeks or months before total recovery, but the pain will lessen and eventually go away. Chronic pain is, well, chronic. It may go through periods where the pain levels vary, but it is almost always present.",,,2,0,0,

e038a184-d3ea-496f-9f65-20567dafebfe,1568829172,"Speak to your main doctor, always. As you've noticed paediatric care is very different, the advice for an adult is always going to be different than for you while you're still growing. Please don't take healthcare advice on the internet when you're a minor, it can cause so much damage to do things the wrong way, especially when you don't have a diagnosis. 

Do you see a physiotherapist? They're the best people to ask about supportive devices and your main doctor should be able to suggest someone. There are canes with seats if you need a break or a family member could carry a lightweight folding chair for you. You might also be suitable for a rollator which allows you to walk normally when you can, lean when you need to and have a seat if you're going to be waiting a while. A physio may have other suggestions, you might be suitable for (joint) braces or other devices. As you're going with family I wouldn't worry about peripheral vision, they can help you out. As you already use a wheelchair at museums, Disney etc look at the places you'll be going in NYC and see which ones offer chairs for you to use. If you feel good that day, you don't need to use it. Having a hard day, you know it's an option.

Regarding being tired. You're always going to be more tired than everyone else. Speak to your family about this in advance, at 15/16 they may be happy to leave you in the hotel room. List the things that you really want to do and the things you'd be okay with missing. If you're having a tired day then stay at the hotel, rest up, and let your family go off and do the things you're not so fussy about. You don't feel like you're holding people up and can save your energy for the things you really want to do and look after yourself. /u/a41efe1b-da01-4efb-a0a2-a452777c1bc5 's post on this is great. 

Most of all, _enjoy yourself_. It's your sweet 16, do whatever you makes you comfortable and have a good time. Don't push yourself trying to do too much, you'll just tire yourself out and not get the same fun out of things. In NY there will always be more things to do than you could ever fit in, and that goes for people who are 100% able and healthy too.

Assuming you don’t, you’ll need to go online and download the application from nelnet, and bring it in for your doctor to sign. You then mail that, along with alllll the supporting documentation you can find (basically all the info from your diagnosis, plus the last year or so of medical records), to nelnet. They take about 60 days to review your application, and may approve it, deny it, or ask for more info. 

By contrast, if you have a 5-7 year SSDI review, you just print the letter off with the application (that you sign for yourself) and mail those in for an automatic approval.

If you’re going to apply, you can call in to your loan servicer and have your loans put into forbearance for 12 months so you won’t pay a dime while you get this all sorted out. Even if you don’t, though, when you’re approved you’ll have all the payments you made between the date you mailed your packet and the date of your approval returned to you by the treasury about 30 days after your approval. 

Final note: **Apply right now**. The only good thing that Trump has done is that he had the rules changed so that student loan write-offs no longer count as income.

When we were sitting around the fire, ADHD was an asset since the slightest rustling on the edge of the circle of light would grab their attention and cause them to focus on it. So walking dead type situation? We would be great. We might also do some dangerous stuff like accidentally poison ourselves which is a common danger  in unmedicated ADHDers today. But we’d be good at being alert and hyper focused. But in modern society we can be heavily debilitated and disabled. I’ve read a few ADHD researchers say that ADHD is the most debilitating of all mental health illnesses within psychology. Their argument is that ADHD untreated has devastating outcomes like raising probability of being in a car crash by 40-42%, reducing life expectancy by as much as 15 years, reducing lifetime earnings, increasing suicide risk, causing secondary symptoms such as depression and anxiety, increasing risk of teen pregnancy and suicide, increasing probability of drug use and prison time, as well as leading to some of the leading causes of death in the western world (heart disease, suicide, type 2 diabetes, etc). A lot of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia will get angry about this and say that it’s completely inaccurate to say that ADHD is worse than bipolar and schizophrenia. I’m not a researcher so it’s only what I’ve read. I do have adhd and bipolar disorder and I can say with certainty that adhd would have taken my life long before bipolar ever did. How do I know? I was diagnosed with and managing bipolar disorder for several years without much improvement. It wasn’t until I got diagnosed with adhd at age 26 and received medication that my symptoms improved greatly and I was able to focus on the left over bipolar. I’m still debilitated by a lot of adhd and bipolar but medication helps me at least live a relatively quality life. I know disability is a spectrum and it’s hard to see certain things like adhd as a disability but in a lot of ways that’s what makes them so covert and difficult to live with.",,,1,0,0,

The much longer answer is you might have to during the interview process if there are parts of the job that will require accommodations so that you can clarify your needs and see if the organization is a good fit. One thing you learn over time is that the ADA does not make people magically understand how disability works and there are many things that an employer can do to make your life very difficult. Often times discussing it early in the application process will tell you how much the employer will be willing to work with you. I like to call the HR department and ask for clarification on a specific job duties or what an average work day will look like. What the work area looks like. I have a bunch that I use. If I get push back at that point in the application process it will more then likely be hard to work with the HR department in the future when I need accommodations so I move on to other options. This makes the process take longer and eliminates tons of options but I can say this. When I did this and had time and found one that took my requests seriously the pay off on the other end was great and when I needed a job and did not have the time to be picky my experience was not near as good with one exception. 

If you get a job and need help getting accommodations ask I have a little experience doing it and I know some tricks if you get push back.",,,3,0,0,

If you are truly only earning $60/mo and that remains static, it shouldn't decrease your benefits at all. You should still report it, of course.

The best way I have found to do this is through the mobile wage reporting app that you can download right to your phone. A quick and easy way to report your earnings each month without going anywhere in person or talking on the phone.

EDIT: It's a good idea to report your prior month's earnings on the first of every month or at least before the 5th of the month if possible.

ed9717cf-3226-42a4-ab07-b8830b72c4a9,1567645732,"Wonderful blog.

My problem: I (F22) am in college. I was seriously injured just after my freshman year, causing me to need a wheelchair full time (my legs are smushed). Before the accident, I dated a lot and was sexually active. After the accident and some time to recover I wanted to start dating again. I had no trouble meeting guys from school (I am studying chemical engineering, the male to female ratio is in my favor here). We would go for lunch, ice cream, coffee, and sometimes dinner. However, the guys I was with somehow thought I was too fragile and would not get physical. Like most girls I expected the guys to take the initiative in such matters. Really, although my legs won't work everything above my legs worked fine.

I finally realized that I was going to have to take a little more intuitive myself. I was with a guy after a nice dinner, back in my apartment. We had been making out but he kept his hands to himself. It was obvious from the lump in his pants that he was interested, but he seemed afraid to express it in any way. So I told him that I would need his help getting ready for bed (I really did not). So he helped me out of my shirt and it was becoming even more obvious that he was very interested. After helping me remove my skirt and panties and then lifting me into the bed he was really excited. I pointed out to him that there was room for him and nature took its course.

So now I know that I have to take a little more initiative. I ask guys to go out with me and then take a little more initiative when things get more physical.",,,2,0,0,

You know this already but others do not and I believe that is the crux of many of the issues that we face,  especially when dealing with the public. 

We face much higher rates of depression/mental illness and domestic violence than the general public and many of the resources available to them are not available to us. I speak as a survivor who has slipped through every crack in the system because I'm in a wheelchair.  Feel free to PM me if you want to know more about this and some other issues that I have faced and haven't seen talked about. I believe that this is one of the biggest issues plaguing our community and I don't wanna be silent anymore.

  There are 2 big things you could do that will really help disabled survivors:

1. If you find anything that promotes awareness on that subject,  share it. Spread it as far as you can!  Even if you just feel like making a post about that huge issue one day, you might really make a difference. 

2.  Most importantly, be sensitive.   A lot of disable people have a lot of trauma in their background.  You don't have to walk on eggshells around us, but just showing  disabled people that you know this and care can make a world of difference!   

 Feel free to add on if any fellow survivors read this.

Your friends are right, autism is commonly seen with Dyspraxia, which is its own disorder focusing on balance and muscle coordination, and can contribute to clumsiness itself. Not every clumsy autistic person has Dyspraxia, but it's relatively common if the clumsiness is severe enough that it's a regular threat. You may be able to see a general practitioner or a physical therapist and talk about your balance concerns, as they're more likely to know how to help your particular issues and can walk you through exercises to increase your coordination and on how to fall safely if needed, plus can help with making sure you're using and fitting a cane properly (if it's in your left hand, it goes forward when your *right* foot steps forward.)",,,4,0,0,

I would remind them that not all relationships feel super natural and that's okay. They may make a great friend, they may not. Can they switch buddies if they don't click?

Making friends with people with disabilities is the same process as with anyone else, although perhaps with a bit more mindfulness and maybe flexibility. Look for common interests, respect boundaries. It's probably easier for adults to gauge the comfort level someone has with sharing about their disabilities than it is for a middle schooler (not that it's easy for adults). Maybe they could remember to add ""if you're comfortable with sharing?"" to questions about health or limitations. At that age some kids want (their disabilities) to be understood or need to vent and others just want you to go off of what they volunteer. 

Best of luck and if you have any more questions, feel free to ask. Plus let us know how the program works out. It sounds intriguing.",,,6,0,0,

Some of the autistic people at my school get picked on for it. They tend to not have very many friends and there's this whole set of stereotypes and assumptions people make and it's not, well, it's not great, it's not good, it's very very bad. 

I'm such a believer in the prioritisation of mental health and the importance of it that it hurts me to know that there are people subject to trauma and to abuse because of a disability and because of the mystery and ideas, badly researched, stereotyped ideas, sorrounding said disability. Even at my school. 

Do you think that there is something that I can do, maybe a system I could suggest setting up to stop this? Everyone knows the ""report bullying"" thing doesn't work. It just doesn't. You don't get taken seriously and even still a bully knowing they were reported is only going to further isolate and stigmatise you. Be warned it's never just one person and people start to see you weird. You just can't report it half the time.

I really love this resource, since it's really comprehensive. It's from the *United Spinal Org*:

The first link on the [Home Modification Funding page](https://askus-resource-center.unitedspinal.org/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=1693)  is broken but I found the new location for the article!

[**How to pay for it! (it being a home modification)**](http://www.infinitec.org/how-to-pay-for-it) 


There are various organizations that can help you much more than the people you have encountered, but they tend to be very local centric. For example, I in washington there are organizations that have been funded through the government and donations that provide downpayment assistance 
like [this](http://www.wshfc.org/buyers/downpayment.htm)


So, if I were you I'd do some google searches with different terms like ""disability home modification loan [relevant region you are looking in]"" or ""downpayment assistance disability [location]"" 

I suggest you check out these guides if you're interested in buying as well: https://www.trulia.com/guides/accessibility-home-buying-guide/

*Additional resources about buying a home:*
https://www.usa.gov/finding-home

https://www.hud.gov/topics/buying_a_home (you need to select ""homebuying program in your state"" -&gt; select your state -&gt; navigate on the respective site to ""Homebuying Programs"" and look around)



If you find no viable results after exploring these links, please let me know and I'll do my best to help you find resources relevant to you, but unfortunately many home modification financing and grant options for people with disabilities are either very local specific so I'd ask that you please state where you're interested in finding a home and need funding. Sometimes there are also disability specific grants (like for people with ALS, or spinal cord injury, or newly injured etc). 



Finding property managers that accept section 8 are also difficult to find. And you'll be even less likely to find a realtor who knows much about disability unless they specialize in it (maybe see if there are realtors near you that market to seniors?). Many are uneducated and suspicious, but some are outright discriminatory! So, take notes somewhere of those who reject you based on your government assistance, for they can and should be reported(but don't feel pressured to do so unless you have bandwidth, which is why I recommend just writing the name down for future reference to report).

Here are my recommendations for anyone going to a Disney Park with young kids:

Spend some time in Baby Care at Guest Services to cool down. Interact with cast members and ask for stickers or trade pins. Go during the off season. Go back to the hotel during the hottest part of the day for a swim or a nap. Take a day off in the middle of the vacation to not go to the parks and just relax at the hotel/around town. Talk with your kids and their priorities so you don't force them to ride every ride when they want to watch parades or meet characters. Spend time in the more relaxing areas/parks (Epcot, Hollywood studios, and parts of California adventure are great for this). Take lots of breaks, drink lots of water, and don't forget that you're on vacation, not competing in the Disney Olympics.

Permanent disability is not black-and-white like most government agencies portray it to be. This person probably doesn’t understand the gravity of a TPD Discharge and thinks that it’s a courtesy for disabled people who will earn a little money, but considerably less over their lifetime.  Also, attending university with accommodations can be very different from the ability to work a job that would allow a disabled person to live without external supports. Also disabled people are more likely to accrue undue higher tuition debt over time for having to drop classes, retake classes, and not being able to reach the minimum credit hours per semester necessary to reach “flat rate tuition.”

I'm sorry the HOA are being such wankers about it, and good for you for standing up for your basic needs and rights.

Honestly, when I bought my first house a few years ago, any property that was part of an HOA or condo association was an instant ""no"". I've heard so many nightmare stories about them. (Obviously not everyone is in a situation to do that, and in some places condos/apartments are far more common than houses, so no judgement - I just happen to live in a small city where individual houses are the standard.)

Under IDEA, a student actually doesn't need a medical diagnosis to qualify for special education (and, in fact, the existence of a diagnosis isn't enough to qualify on its own). It is true that they do need to fall into an identifiable category, and some organizations like the National Association of Special Education Teachers is now pushing back on that. The logic is that if we can group similar children with similar types of behaviors or similar needs, it's easier for us to provide services. 

Of course, the reality is that one child with any given classification can be very, very different from another. For example, since I was only ever evaluating young children, something like 90% of our cases ended up as Developmentally Delayed. That included kids at polar opposites of the ""delayed"" spectrum. Good school districts will still try to use the social model -- they'll modify their own systems to adapt to their individual learners as much as possible. Bad districts... won't.

I think it is great a disabled actress was cast in the role, and it's also fine that it appears to be the role of an abled person. This might not have been as big a deal had I done enough research to know any of this beforehand. I guess in a way, I also made an unfair assumption that she'd play a disabled character (because we often have to, if we get into acting at all).

It's a visual medium where I didn't see the disability I was expecting represented in any meaningful way. I know that there are many invisible disabilities, too, but this typically is not one. 

I think that is why I feel bad. Because for me, what you say ""it is not enough just to have a disabled actor,"" is at the heart of the issue, and I feel bad for feeling that way. I think it should be enough. But I wanted to see some disability on-screen. I definitely do not want the actress to be ""more disabled"" even though she has a progressive condition, and that's another reason I feel bad. I wish her all the health. 

I guess in a way, this is just very new. A disabled person, who doesn't necessarily display impairment (if it's a physical and typically visible disability), and cast in an abled role? How often do we see that anywhere?

I feel like it is disingenuous of me to be disappointed in this way, and yet, I am. But I think you've explained a big part of why I feel this way and why it might not be so wrong to feel it. 

Part of my excitement is also that the character has kind of a cool job that you don't often see disabled people getting into; I wanted to see how the disabled character did that job, and it seems like I won't see that story. So that is part of it too.",,,1,0,0,

\-Get a good haircut. I also have thick curly hair. I find mid-length is easiest. Too short and it's hard to style, too long and it's heavy/takes forever to dry. A good haircut will make you look polished with minimal effort. 

\-Comb conditioner through hair in shower with wide tooth comb before rinsing out, and apply styling products to hair while still sopping wet. This is basically the devacurl method, if you google it you'll find lots of youtube videos.

\-Buy clips in different sizes to keep your hair out of your face and mix up the style throughout the week. This makes it less noticable if your hair isn't the freshest, if you're switching up how you wear it. Also, if you use clips you won't damage your curl pattern with elastic bands.

\-Febreeze is great if you want to rewear something and it's gotten a little smelly in the armpits. Take the garment off, spray the offending area, and wait five minutes. Works great.

\-Lint roller is really effective for removing skin flakes, lint, other stuff on your clothes.

\-Great accessories (interesting glasses, statement earrings, scarf) go a long way with helping you look put together even when you feel like garbage.

\-When possible, keep sores covered with a bandage of some sort. This helps prevent secondary infection, and to some extent protects your clothes.

I have similar challenges, the struggle is real. Good luck!",,,2,0,0,

If, hypothetically, you were not giving your child enough care, the first step from a case worker would be to assign someone to help out at home. Children are only removed from the home in cases of abuse, or if it's not feasible to adequately care for the child in the home even with outside support.

Another plus is that you have a big support network that know what you're dealing with, and how you make up for your limitations. In cases of significant neglect, the parents tend to hide the children away, pretend everything is fine, and move a lot. Just the fact that you're upfront with CPS is a good sign to them.",,,7,0,0,

The ABQ location has been terrible.  We took the chair in for its annual service and despite us telling them in advance to just order all the parts that were on the replacement list they refused to do that until they'd viewed the chair.  So that meant we had to make another 4 hours in a car to drive to ABQ and back for a second visit...which we also had to both take off of work for since they won't do service on a weekend and require that I be there to transfer my wife out of her chair.  Also it took three months for the parts to come in.  Again, all of this was Preventative Maintenance, and thus could have been ordered before we ever went there the first time.  On the second visit they had failed to order the casters...they'd gotten the rest of the parts, but they hadn't put in the order for the casters yet.  So they promised a house call to replace the casters.  Two months pass and we finally get a call that they will be in our area at 8am on Thursday.  At 930 on that Thursday we call asking where our person is and are told that he hadn't left yet as the promise was between 8 and noon and that was the time that he'd leave ABQ.  So we canceled the house call since we'd only taken an hour off of work for this visit and take the next available appointment at the branch, two more months later.  About two weeks ago we finally capped off the saga of the annual PM's for this chair.  It will be time to start the next annual PM rotation in about a month.

Once again, the Dallas NuMotion was amazing and Tom was a great technician who could fix more with a broken wheelchair over Skype than most technicians could in person.  I have zero complaints about the Dallas branch.  But yes I feel your pain.   

The only thing that I know of that gets anything moving is to be the squeaky wheel and be constantly reaching out for updates, you can split this out by having your insurance apply pressure, you calling and your caregiver calling, that way they get hit three times a week for the same case but it doesn't feel like its the same person calling over and over.  The other thing you could possibly try is calling one of the NuMotion national numbers and complaining there...it didn't do much for us, but your mileage may vary.

One of the major issues that people with disabilities face is the transition from school/college to work. It is very hard as the skill set that you develop with or without accommodations does not transition very good to most working environments. 

This makes it very hard to work at ones education level and as a result the unemployment and underemployment rate is very high across the country for this population of people, myself included. 

This is basically unknown or completely misunderstood by the majority of the population and makes it very hard for people with disabilities to work with social service agencies and government institutions that are designed to help them. 

It would also make it much harder to apply for loan forgivness because if a person has a degree or education most people would assume they should be able to work. What they do not do is take into consideration the effect the disability has and if that makes it so that they can not work in their chosen field. So they end up working in a different field and as a result they have a degree in a field they can not work in. 

This reduces their employment opportunities and over there life time their earning potential in almost all cases. This then makes it difficult if not impossible for them to pay back the loans for a degree in a field that they can not work in.

It is easier to get disability with a doctor's long term documentation of your illness but if your illness and its impact on you makes you eligible for disability then you should be able to get it after a few doctors visits.  It may just take more effort. It will depend when you were diagnosed as well. If you were diagnosed years ago and didn't see any doctors your case will seem very suspicious and it will be scrutinized and possibly denied depending on your illness as to why you didn't see the doctor. If you self diagnosed yourself and just now went to a doctor for the first time and got diagnosed you would look more reasonable to get disability.,,,1,0,0,

I've used forearm crutches since I was 15 (I'm a part time user due to a congenital disability, so I have used them long term but not every day) so my experience may be different because I have different crutches for a bilateral impairment. 

They *are* painful, but there is a huge difference between ""phew, arms aren't meant to be used for walking, I'm achey and exhausted"" discomfort and ""these crutches are actively doing my body damage because they're not right for me"" pain.

I second the advice to get a fanny pack and backpack. Store commonly used items like phone and wallet in a fanny pack on the front of your body, and larger items in the backpack, get a well fitting backpack to avoid any extra pressure on your shoulders.

Get a really good reusable water bottle and if you are a coffee drinker get a reusable cup with a lid that seals tight. This way if you're trying to carry drinks from one room to another you don't have to do the awkward ""stick a finger in the cup and clutch it to your crutch and spill half as you walk"" manoeuvre, you can just throw it in your bag till you sit down.

For getting plates from the kitchen counter to the dining table, other than just hopping/hobbling around my house, I have a trolley on wheels, it looks like a metal instrument trolley you'd see at the dentist, it's lightweight plastic and was $5 from a dollar store. I put my stuff on that then I just sort of take a step, balance myself, then push it with one of my crutches, take another step, balance, push it a bit more, until I'm at my destination.

In public, I try to eat at places with table service, buy things I can put in my backpack, or I just ask the cashier extra politely ""would you be able to put my food on that table right there after I pay? I know you don't normally do table service but I can't really carry a plate and drink, I'm sorry, thanks""

When shopping I try to make sure I start with a totally empty backpack, because I do have to stop at each shelf, put the item I want in the backpack, put the backpack on and then keep going. When I get to the check out I make a huge show out of empting my backpack completely onto the conveyor belt. I have had a security guard approach me and ask what I'm doing, I'm upfront and just say ""I know it looks dodgy but I can't carry a basket or push a trolley, I need my hands for walking, and regular shopping bags bang against the crutches, I could trip. I'm happy to be searched upon exiting the store"" 

I've heard that in America some stores have electric scooters anyone with a disability can borrow, and some stores even organise for a ""bagger"" to escort you and help you shop if you call ahei. But that's definitely not a thing here (we don't even have baggers - so another tip for shopping, go at a quiet time and also pick the check out line that's already slow and full of older people so everyone will be patient when you slowly bag your items, don't use the express lane even if you only have a few items, because you probably won't be able to bag it at an express speed) 

Because I use forearm crutches I'm able to carry small things between my fingers while still resting my palm on the hand grip. So I'll hold cash, receipts, small things I'm buying, things people hand me, paperwork for work in my fingers just to grab things and move to the side, then I'll organise my bag once I'm out of the way. 

I also use a lot of hair ties and random bits of string to tie various things to my crutches, like my bus pas swipe card, that way I'm not fishing around in my fanny pack for it.

I've definitely chipped teeth trying to hold things in my teeth because I was too lazy to stop and get my bag off my back. So probably don't do that....


There's no shame in buying some elastic wrist stabilisers or getting some kinesiotape/sports tape to strap up your wrists and shoulders before a walk.

Buy some tiger balm/icy hot and apply to your shoulders, elbows and wrists after a long day to reduce any inflammation and keep them functional for the next day of walking, especially as you are getting used to crutches, because even when fitted properly, unless you used to regularly hit the gym it's likely you are using muscles you don't normally use and/or using them more intensely than you normally would and demanding higher endurance from them. It's going to ache.",,,1,0,1,

Then get elastic laces from amazon or somewhere similar. Seriously. It makes such a huge difference. Getting AFOs into hi tops can be a huge pain in the ass, but adding elastic makes it so much easier

[The UK’s unwritten history of disability](https://disabilityhorizons.com/2016/07/uks-unwritten-history-disability)
&gt; In the early years of the 1900s, people with mental or physical disabilities were branded as “feeble minded” by politicians and scientists. 50 years ago, there was no safety net or welfare system to support disabled people. And it was only 20 years ago that the UK passed laws making discrimination against disabled people illegal.

The disability rights movement is one of the youngest social justice movements in human history.
[Disability History UK - great resource](https://historicengland.org.uk/research/inclusive-heritage/disability-history/1945-to-the-present-day/)
to learn more.  

Attitudes definitely won't change without more education and exposure for PWD. But unfortunately, change is slow, and changing human behavior with education is possible but many curriculums don't even include the history of people with disabilities or their social justice movement efforts... which would allow for more understanding, empathy, and overall inclusion more. 

At least the physical environment was a positive, though!

I encourage you to at least try to educate yourself and those around you about the history of disability if you really want to see attitudes change. It's best to be prepared to educate and advocate for yourself long term than rely on the kindness of others, no matter how difficult it may be.",,,2,0,0,

I have had many a unfriendly conversation about this as I can go through school and get a degree but the transition in to the working world is an entirely different skill set and I am not good at it, at all. 

When you try to explain this to a Voc Rehab counselor they do not understand because they are taught to help you find a job. They do not understand that I went to college to get and education so that I could get a better job than they shitty one I had before that was a shit wage with shit benefits and on prospects for the future. 

This has been my experience. Also them wanting me to use very traditional job search techniques that do not work as there are to many people applying for jobs making it impossible for me to even get an interview. I have to call and talk to an HR department to see if they can provide my specific accommodations or if they will most of the time because there is no point in doing the entire application process and the interviews to figure out that the job is one I can not do or that the accommodations that are needed will be very hard to get.

Showering, shaving, and using the restroom is what I struggle with, personally. There are various other small things that can be a hassle too, like pouring drinks or brushing my teeth, but the small things don't bother me, really. The former three are the things I dread the most. Every time I even think about doing them, dread wells up in my chest. But I do them anyways, and then try to make the most of my time before I have to do them all over again. And of course there's not being able to really leave the house. It's all I can do to not go insane from going stir-crazy. Imagine being in the same place for 4 straight years.

In the end, though, it's all a mindset thing. The whole ""you can do anything you set your mind to"" and ""keep your head up"" things don't work for me, but they work for others.

If it isn't free, it shouldn't cost you much because it basically simply means screwing the spokes tighter in some places on a truing jig.

If you've got quick release wheels, try swapping the wheels and seeing if the lean occurs on the opposite side. If it doesn't, it would rule out the rear wheels, but it might mean your frame or axle is bent.

If that's the case, consider still going to a local bike shop or contacting a metal shop in your area because they might be able to twist it back in place for you. If it's the axle, you might need a replacement, which will inevitably be more specialized than I can offer help on. Hope this helps.",,,1,0,0,

He can still stop them in the future if he finds a different way of supporting himself. The idea that he is less valuable or doesn't have a place in the world or ability to make a difference if he isn't earning a wage can be really damaging. Add to that even if you are willing to support him aside from the stress you might be feeling that isn't the safest or best position for him. Disability isn't much and is a PITA to get but at least it would be his. Moving to Canada isn't that easy and even if it was what would the difference be aside from benefits, in which case why would moving there to get them be okay but taking them where you are not be?

 But if you know she can't help it, just like you can't help it, it would, at the very least, seem a little unfair to actually *ask* her to change something that is very clearly something she *must* do to keep from losing her train of thought. You know that she isn't doing it to ignore or invalidate you. In fact, if she *needs* to do this right away to avoid losing the thought, it is likely she is trying to contribute to or give feedback to the conversation the two of you are having--which is the opposite of ignoring you, although I know it doesn't feel like that. My s/o and I both really resent when we interrupt the other, and neither of us have brain fog issues, so there is no excuse for us to do so as often as we do, we're just being rude to each other, so I understand why it feels invalidating to you.

Without knowing a bit more, it's difficult to give advice since your symptoms seem to cancel one another out or, more precisely, exacerbate things. She can't not say anything, and the interruptions are difficult for you. 

The one difference that might be present is that these issues are actually affecting your mental health, where for her that might be less so. I assume it is incredibly frustrating to feel like you'll lose your train of thought if you do not speak up soon enough, though. I guess you could have a discussion about the frequency of the interruptions and whether some of them might be best just left unsaid, if what she is wanting to say is not, in her estimation, important. 

That said, I assume the reason she interrupts you mid-speech is to add to the conversation before she forgets what she wanted to contribute,and unlike others, she can't hold it until you're done, otherwise she'll have nothing to contribute. Or, that is what it sounds like from the information you give.

Obviously, the OP will never know until she applies and - only after a job offer is extended - can the employer begin to ask medical questions. And, the employer cannot withdraw the job offer unless you are not a qualified employee - meaning that you can perform the essential functions of the job - with an accommodation. What would that look like? Well, you’d have to show that you can accomplish the goals/tasks that are essential to the job by working a part time schedule vs full time.

I don't live in Wisconsin, but Section 8 and the quality of the apartments themselves can vary greatly. My area doesn't have a huge crime rate of which I am aware, and as far as I can tell, the housing complex doesn't affect this metric one way or another. The city I live in is just kind of small, although it is industrial and has a lot of international companies, and it has low COL. These things likely affect how ""good"" the neighborhoods are moreso than Section 8 being Section 8. The complex in my area is fairly new, I think a little over a decade old, and the quality seems fine. 

One thing I would change is the flimsy windows, but having traveled to places outside the U.S., I think this might be a U.S. problem. Windows in apartments I've been to elsewhere are super thick, strong, and practically soundproof. 

In short, Section 8 does have standards, but everything is too variable to give you any idea of whether your area is ""good"" or not. 

My complex has had issues with loitering, solicitation, and unapproved guests staying (living) with others for long periods of time. At least one suicide, but I would not say that is because it is Section 8, of course.

It's tough to find dates, but not impossible.  The dating pool is definitely smaller when you're disabled, I'll agree with that %100.  I also identify with a lot of her vulnerable spots: Worries about whether or not I'm going to fit in his car or get into his house; if I'm going to look ""too gimpy"" when moving around; if he's going to feel awkward or put upon if I need help, or if the helping dynamic is going to dampen the sexual dynamic.  

I haven't always been disabled; it happened when I was 22yo.  And yes, there was a distinct difference with how most men treated me before and after.  I dropped off the sexual radar for about %85 of them.  It was pretty shocking to me, and painful, to suddenly be treated as if I was invisible.  Now I understand it's more about fear and ignorance than about some personal failure of mine.

Remember: Confidence and a sense of humor about the situations you find yourself in goes a long way towards attraction and diminishing any awkwardness.

Also remember: Protect your heart.  Some people you date may feel at first that they can deal with your disability, but then later find out that they can't -- then they leave, and that can hurt like hell.  I learned this the hard way.  It doesn't make them a bad person, just a person who didn't think things through.  And that happens, because they've probably never dated someone with a disability before.

These days I protect myself by not going ""all in"" with my feelings right away.  I'm not cold or anything, I just hold off in the first couple months and observe...then if The Conversation comes up about getting more serious with each other, I bring up the disability and my concerns.  Then if I feel they know what they're getting into and are OK with it, I'll be OK with opening up more.  I'd rather it not have to be this way, but at this point I feel like this is what I have to do to protect myself.",,,9,0,0,

That a job that expects you to do limited walking, expects you to be able to do that every single time you work, which is impossible. (If there’s a job that allows you to just show up on the occasions when you feel up to it, I haven’t heard of it.) And that even if you could walk every day, the persistent vomiting would still be there. You can’t be a reliable employee if you have to go vomit all the time. I have a bladder disease, and SSA took into consideration that having to go to the bathroom four to six times *per hour* would make it virtually impossible for me to hold onto any job. That wasn’t the sole basis for their decision, but it factored in. 

The SSA is not playing fair with you. They ignored things like the vomiting and the hospitalizations, and cherrypicked one thing you said as a basis for denial. Their goal is not to help you. Their goal is  to turn you down. They have limited funds to go around, so their goal is pretty much to deny everyone. You need to stand up for yourself. When you tell them about the vomiting, describe your worst day. Same with the walking. Describe your worst day. Give the highest number of hospital visits you’ve ever had in one year. Your lawyer will tell you the same. 

The presumption is you’re an adult who needs a job you can support yourself on, including housing and food, clothing and general necessities, transportation, healthcare, and whatever I’ve forgotten to include. That’s what substantial and gainful work means. 

Look, I don’t know if you’ll get approved. But it’s *definitely* worth taking it to a lawyer. If you lose, the lawyer just doesn’t get paid at all; it’s not your problem. It’s how the system works. You might be billed for, like, their photocopy costs, but nothing much. Which is why they’re not going to take the case at all if it’s hopeless.

To you’re point regarding some individuals were born in this institution and know nothing else.. this is also seen in many other instances as the very reason to explore community options - because the individual knows no other option aside from what they were born in to. How does a person who was born in a segregated institution know what their other options are and that they’re not interested in them?

I don’t doubt that residents live good lives and that they are treated well. However, it sounds like they are segregated. Segregated in that they are only interacting with their care providers and other people with disabilities. Again, I don’t doubt many people are happy with living there, and I hope their transition into the community is thoughtful and well planned.

I would recommend finding and connecting with your local Center for Independent Living. They can provide resources, services, and support for all of the individuals transitioning out of the institution and into the community at no cost to the individual with a disability.",,,8,0,0,

It takes a minute to get it adjusted, but he doesn’t experience much if any noticeable air loss over the course of the day. The filling valve is pretty sturdy and withstands movement and pressure. It has several sections of air chambers, and after several years, one of the chambers sprung a leak. I think you can patch it, but we haven’t yet. He’s trying a gel/foam cushion now to see if it’s any better or worse. Seems to be ok, and his medical condition makes him sensitive to pressure.

I agree with you on brushing things under the carpet. I mean, you can have a character who happens to be disabled and just living life. That's great.

89a0fabd-1881-4c1a-8ab0-b0affedec554,1567461964,"If you want to try qualifying for disability based on depression/ IBS: The first thing to do is start compiling a lengthy Medical Record. This is *imperative* for qualifying for SS(d)I, even with an attorney, to have at least a few months of diagnosis/treatment prior to your initial application. If you do not have insurance, inquire at your local Dept. of Human Services for Free Clinic resources in your area. If you have painful or dangerous episodes, go to your local ER... relentlessly, if necessary. There is probably a state-funded mental health clinic that can treat you outpatient if you do not have access to traditional doctors/insurance.   
Once you have your diagnosis/ treatment plan... Follow That Plan as best you can and if it doesn't work, go back to the treating physician. When you are with your doctor, really focus on telling them how your illnesses keep you from performing your Activities of Daily Living (ADLs.) Sometimes you will get referred to physical or vocational therapy to assist with your ADLs. If these therapies work, great... if not, tell your treating physician/therapist you need further accommodation, and why. At this point, you've applied for benefits.  If you have a sufficient medical record, the SSA makes a determination based on your record, if not... you go to a Examining Doctor, who may or may not even specialize in your condition. Probably you will get turned down at initial application level. Get an **attorney** when this happens.  
All throughout your case waiting to appeal/get a hearing... KEEP GOING to the doctor. Really focus on telling them WHAT you can't do, how you compensate, and what (if anything) will make it easier for you. Get as many pages of diagnostic testing and treatment notes into your Medical Record as possible. Do you need the restroom every hour? How long is each trip? Can you *run* to the restroom and back to your workstation? Why not? Have you tried *many* medications for depression? Why didn't they work? So some cause suicidal thoughts and others make you nauseated? These are just examples, but we have to be SPECIFIC when speaking to our doctors to make sure the *right words* get into the Record.   
I'll stop typing for now, but I hope this helps somebody somewhere get the process started.

Talk to you doctors and find out if they will support your pursuit of disability benefits.

The application process is a little strange, and I recommend organizing your notes and records in advance. The medical section is something like:
Doctor
Doctor contact information
When did you start seeing the doctor?
When was your last appointment?
When is your next appointment?
What does this doctor treat you for?
What does this doctor do to treat you?
Do they proscribe any medications?
List medications.

You will be asked about your work history. Employers, dates, tasks, amount earned. The back pay folks are talking about are for folks who have work history. You may not have enough work history credits for SSDI, you may only be eligible for SSI.

You can apply online at the social security website.

But many times, she's able to go without me. She used part of her holidays to go to South Korea recently. And while I know she would have a good time with me there with her, I also know she had a pretty amazing time being able to do things and see the country (her first time there) in the way she wanted, without me. And I'm okay with that. 

It's certainly okay to be upset, but I would think most of the upset would come from ""I wish I could do those things with you"" and not ""I wish you didn't want to do those things.""

My partner and I share many common interests, but she has ones, and ways of acting on those interests, that I just can't do. Or, not as well. It would be very cruel of me, IMHO, to be upset in a way that I insisted she alter her life in a big way for me like that. She already goes to great lengths to make this all work (as do I).
