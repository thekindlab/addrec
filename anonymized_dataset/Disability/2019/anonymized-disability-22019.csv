Her work was affected so much she was audited. I don't find an issue with her chatting with coworkers, but I see a clear separation when socializing with an attending. No one in my department has permission to talk with our providers except me. There's a difference between coworkers and physicians at my hospital. To me it's an acceptable rule because our providers are oncologists, specifically pancreatic cancer, so its a bit more somber where I work. In addition, I fail to see how disciplinary actions regarding other employees is relevant. How I discipline others is not anyone's business besides me and that employee. I've had an employee word for word state how another biller was reprimanded. I fired them both. Discussions about write ups and pay are not to be discussed. For any reason. 

I didn't mean to come across as arrogant but I am proud of my position and I earned it. I'm  the youngest in my department and I take pride in my career. I worked very hard and although I strayed away from obtaining my medical degree  I love the job I have. I am extremely proud of my family who are doctors. They worked hard. I'm in awe of anyone that survives the process. Being a doctor is a great accomplishment. As is obtaining your law degree. I don't view it as entitlement.

How long have you been using it? Maybe give it time? Or think of what your cane provides you?

I love my cane. Though I have used it (or something similar) most of my life. It provides me with opportunity to be outside my home, it keeps pain at bay and it helps me to feel empowered and secure.

My cane used to belong to someone I love dearly so it does have sentimental value and I get compliments on it so that does help but I almost never feel it is a nuisance because I get so much from it.

***
I have disabilities and am married.

I am extremely lucky to have fallen in mutual love with a long term friend. He is aware that my disability changes how I interact with the world but doesn’t treat me like it’s my sole defining characteristic. 

Before that relationship, the people I dated &amp; had relationships with seemed to think it was okay to ignore my disability except when it inconvenienced them. They seemed to think that me casually talking about it at all was a sign of cowardice or weakness and had no interest in being patient when I tried to adapt so that I could share their interests. 

Dating is complicated even between two abled people. The world is filled with love songs, stories, blog posts, and whole Reddit subs dedicated to the complexities involved in getting to know another person and form an intimate bond. 

It isn’t much of a stretch to awareness that disability complicates relationships. That isn’t to say that it’s impossible to have a healthy disabled x abled relationships, or that they aren’t worth having. 

Sorry for the long rant. It’s frustrating to see, even in a disability forum, the prevalence of “it’s just a state of mind” platitudes. ",,,4,0,0,

While it is pretty normal to get denied the first time, it was only about 50/50 whether you get approved or denied last time I checked (something like 53% or so got denied the first time). I was approved for SSI about 5 months after I submitted my application so it's not impossible to avoid appealing them for years and years. There is also a group on facebook according to one of my ehlers-danlos support groups that is specifically for people applying for disability based on an EDS diagnosis, so if you're on facebook I would try looking for that. They may be able to help you more specifically as I didn't file based on EDS because mine didn't become evident beyond joint hypermobility until the last few years and I applied about 8 years ago. Since EDS and its common comorbidities require the care of multiple doctors a lot of times, the amount of documentation of your issues would help you out, especially since EDS can be difficult to treat and you have gone into shock from treatment attempts before.

I would also say to contact your county office of temporary assistance, some areas do temporary rental assistance if it's an emergency like yours.

It's not like I didn't know I used a cane until some curious kid outted me in the checkout line at Walmart, and usually the parents have been staring for the last five minutes so that would have tipped me off anyway. 

I really appreciate simple explanations that aren't demeaning. I hear a lot of, ""That probably helps her get around,"" and then they compare me to some elderly family figure, and I let that slide because that's a context a child could understand. Those parents get gold stars from me. 

I really don't like kids. They're loud and rambunctious and unpredictable and I don't understand how they're always sticky. I make a real effort to engage kids curious about my disability, though. I think it's an important part of removing the stigma around disability, and it's really refreshing to not have people act so horrified when I tell them using a cane or a wheelchair helps me feel good. I like the poster here who said they encourage their children to talk to the people they notice. Kids staring or talking about me can grate on me. But I had this really great conversation this one time about how my cane matched a girl's backpack at the airport, and isn't purple a great color, and how come I need a cane if I'm in a wheelchair, and why don't they make the wheelchairs at the airport purple? I could never just have a conversation like that with a grown up, it really made my day. 

Also, please educate your kids about service animals. Just as a policy, kids should never run up to strange dog even if it's not a service animal, but this happens to me all the time. Teach your kids to calmly approach someone and ask permission to pet their dog, and accept no if that's the answer. And if the dog is wearing a vest that means it's working and not to try to excite it. My dog isn't a service animal, but he helps a lot with my pain and I will travel with him for longer flights to limit how much pain medication I need to take. He does great at airports and on planes, he's very well behaved in crowds, no one ever knows he's even on the plane, and I've never had a problem. But kids who don't know how to act make me nervous. I've had to physically step in front of my dog and extend my cane like a shield and shout, ""Do not touch my dog,"" to prevent a scene. He's a great dog, but if three children start screaming and sprinting towards me, he's going to get protective. Not aggressive, but he might growl at them, and I'm sure someone will film it and it'll go viral about how I'm some entitled millennial gaming the system and putting our children at risk because parents can't control their damn kids.

I'm very confused. If my mother's anxiety (+ other serious issues) aren't determined by SSA as ""severe impairment(s)"" (since it may be difficult) then do they determine that she is disabled by her 0 work experience, advanced age (55), and 10th grade education by the Medical-Vocational Guidelines?

I'm curious why you kept applying before instead of appealing your rejections.

A disability (SSi/SSDI expert) attorney specializes in handling application appeals. They take no money up front. Their fee is a percentage of the initial payment you get when you are accepted, which is capped at a reasonable amount.

If you have access to the information about your medical records (ie. what doctors you've seen, their addresses and numbers, dates of appointments [things like Jan-May 2005 would be fine], etc.) you may be able to re-apply again by yourself. If your records are scattered, a disability attorney may help.

Generally I don't recommend people getting an attorney for an initial application, but one of their big specialties is gathering medical records when they can. 

Also note that a disability attorney will not take your case unless they believe you have a chance of winning. However, a consultation is free, too.",,,1,0,0,

honestly, it might be mandated you keep it depending on disability, mine is renal failure and for the first 30 months its optional, after that because the costs are so high, you have to get and pay for medicaid. but i have to keep my private insurance for my family. so both are mandated in my situation.",,,2,0,0,

The SSI resource limits are $2000 for individuals and $3000 for couples. Here is a list of resources exempted from the SSI resource limits. [https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0501110210](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0501110210).

There are not resource limits for Social Security Disability Insurance, SSDI and its non medical eligibility is based on your recent history of working and paying into Social Security prior to becoming disabled by their medical criteria. Earned income may impact your SSDI. See this PDF brochure from SSA on working while disabled. [https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10095.pdf](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10095.pdf). SSDI is generally exempt from taxation unless your earned income and other taxable income is above certain thresholds then a portion of your SSDI may be subject to Federal taxes. See [https://www.irs.gov/faqs/social-security-income/regular-disability-benefits/regular-disability-benefits](https://www.irs.gov/faqs/social-security-income/regular-disability-benefits/regular-disability-benefits). 

I strongly recommend contacting a representative from SSA to see whether you are eligible for SSDI or SSI or both. If you are eligible for SSDI only, there is no resource limit. Earned income can impact your benefits and other income can impact your Federal income taxes, but you are not required to liquidate any assets to maintain eligibility. There are no limits on unearned income for SSDI, but a portion of your SSDI may be taxable if your total income exceeds certain amounts. If you have any questions about these rules please let me know. Best wishes!

What the insurance company is doing here is simplifying your wife's occupation based on the level of physical exertion. It's not an uncommon tactic. But physical exertion is really inapplicable to a migraine headache condition - migraines don't make you physically incapacitated the way, for example, a bad back does. And if your wife performs a sedentary occupation, they don't pay her to sit in a chair eight hours a day, they pay her to use her brain. The key is to get a copy of the job description and provide that (don't assume her company has already provided it).

Migraines are like seizures - you need to focus on frequency and severity. The clinical indication for Botox is at least 15 headache days a month. If the severity is such that her migraines incapacitate her completely (dark room, vomiting, etc), then missing work 15 days a month makes her unemployable. That's what you would need to focus on.

Eg: someone who has heart problems returns part time work but it's physically demanding. That demonstrates medical improvement. But someone with heart problems starts a part time sedentary job with accomodations. That does not show medical improvement.

Low earnings, however, don't necessarily establish that you're unable to work. The SSA will consider the circumstances under which you performed work. For example, where a disability applicant had worked as a substitute bus driver, the court found that he was doing SGA because his low earnings did not indicate that he was unable to work, and his income was less than it could be because of the on-call nature of the job.

The first quote is literally a violation of so many laws just on that alone I probably could have sued this place and walked away retired for the rest of my life. The second meeting just made me sweat, but it is true: in a right to work state they don't have to give a reason as to why they fired you. However, in your case, they gave a reason, and it doesn't sound like it's a legal reason to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Comparing disabilities, I had to tell co-workers around me about my epilepsy and once it got to the point that I stopped driving, almost all the company knows, which is fine by me. The more ppl who know, the more ppl who ask me questions about epilepsy and the more I can do good for other epileptics as I can teach them real things about it. At no point was I warned not to do so, nor was it frowned upon here. If I can do that here in Kentucky, I seriously doubt the labor laws here are much different and on a federal level they have to be the same. It is illegal for your employer to tell ppl about your disability. That's a violation of your HIPAA rights. however, you have every right in the world to tell everyone about your disabilities, period!

I'm aware that a writer only includes what is necessary, but I don't think I've communicated that even if the greater themes are somewhat separate from the character's disability, certain events in the story, along with the character's arc will still largely concern it. Therefore, their disability is necessary to *their* story, which would be in line with the greater themes and elements at play. Although this could just be me not understanding things.

However I disagree with you when it comes to diversity in general needing to be the main point of the story it appears in.

And with my current gut issue my stomach hasn't been tolerating or absorbing food very well which has led to weakness and alot of joint pain and headaches. I often need help with everything but don't have the resources. I've fallen in my shower before, it's extremely hard for me to do laundry and getting dressed is a nightmare I'm constantly about to fall and have to grab at something last minute or break my fall with my hands which has lead to joint pain in my arms. Living alone is extremely difficult for me. Living in a car would be worse for me but I don't see any other option.  I filled on eds and all my other conditions.

Not sure where you live, but in a university's case, many are required to have a certain percentage of students of minority races/ethnicity. However, there are typically no requirements for disabled student numbers. Moreover, monitoring how many disabled students they have could be considered discriminatory or lead to discriminatory practices, as they would likely accept only the percentage required to meet national requirements and then reject all other disabled students out of convenience.

ab79de79-0229-458c-a4d5-5c0a08df738a,1550080402,"Thank you for your reply. I always appreciate hearing others' views on this.

Would you agree that people abuse the disabled parking spaces? Do you think all doctors pay attention to the criteria? Do you think the police do a good job tending to the validity of people's use of the spaces? What if a police officer asked to see your proof of disability? Would you be offended if they are literally doing their job and checking for validity of your need to park there? If nobody ever checks this and there are no consequences, do you think the parking spaces would be more or less abused?

I can appreciate your position as I have a progressive disorder that was practically invisible 20 years ago as well. However, I was never offended when someone asked me about my parking validity because IF I didn't deserve to be parking there, I'd have been caught or at least shamed and maybe I wouldn't have parked there again. The social pressure put on by everyday people is more helpful at policing the spaces than police who don't seem to pay attention unless someone calls it in. 

As a result, I can't get on board with ignoring everyone who parks in the disabled spaces just because they might be offended.

Having said that, I don't like that you feel judged when you go out. That sucks. But there are actual people who abuse the parking spaces and ruin it for you, me, and everyone who needs them. If doctors were more strict, like the OP mentioned, then the problem wouldn't be as prevalent and we could assume that everyone parking there needs it and goes about their business.

You deserve to park in the space. You owe nobody an explanation. If you are asked for proof or judged for that, know that YOU are right and what someone else thinks doesn't matter at all. If someone does ask you, however, know that their intention is to make sure that the spaces are used properly, and it really isn't a judgement on you. It's a judgement about every asshole who has parked in those spaces illegitimately before. That person asking you is really just looking out for you.

And that's why when people questioned me, I'd actually thank them for paying attention to it and move on with my life.

Perhaps you'd have better luck trying to date someone in similar circumstances?   


I've got a rather invisible disability, but I'd had a lot of difficulty dating once people started to see or realize the extent of my health issues. The two people I've dated that lasted any duration were: a guy who grew up with a mother with health issues and also with so severe a crippling anxiety disorder he was on Disability; and a guy with really severe Tourette's. Even though our disabilities were different, we could relate to one another, and neither saw my disability as scary.  


Perhaps if you use a dating site/app, and explain in your introduction or post a picture of yourself where it's clearly visible that you have a disability, you won't have to deal with the awkward issue of having to explain it later. I make sure to explain right off the bat that I wear an eyepatch, I use a cane, and I outline my basic limitations, so that I only attract people who are already OK with my situation. I'd rather be usually alone and have a few interested parties every so often than have repeated interest that disappears as soon as I'm up front about my health.   


(I was dating a guy for a few weeks when I got my medical coverage approved and thought at the time I was going to get brain surgery. I was really excited and wanted to celebrate. He was aghast, and didn't even break up with me - he just didn't answer the door when I knocked, even though I lived right across the hall. What a waste of my time!)  


I don't know if this is an inappropriate suggestion, but there are people who actually like the idea of dating someone while also being their caregiver. I think they call themselves ""Devotees""? Most in the disabled community find it distasteful and demeaning to be objectified for their disabilities, but there's a lot of people who enjoy being sexualized and wanted, and see that kind of attention as no different than being lusted after for having large breasts. It might at least be a source for practicing flirting online?  


Regardless, be safe in whomever you deal with. There are a lot of people who take advantage of any perceived weakness. Don't get too sucked in to anyone online, there's a lot of people who lie about who they are and what their intentions are.  ",,,2,0,0,

e331d1f6-573c-45e2-8990-cd3aa0f194a0,1549472023,"I mean, let’s be honest: very few people are going to choose to stay in a wheelchair if there are better options available. Being in a wheelchair is an *unimaginably* huge pain in the ass. 

That being said, leg braces are painful, and a lot of people in wheelchairs aren’t there because of paralysis, but because of different reasons.

If it’s “simple” paralysis, chances are it would have long since been cured by the time your story takes place. Even today, they’ve had success ~~“curing”~~ bypassing paralysis using VR and spinal stimulation stuff. For the rich, I expect simple paralysis to be curable by the end of my lifetime.

That being said, there’s nothing wrong with using a convention for your story’s sake.

If it were my story, I would have him use an exo-skeleton or spinal stimulator most of the day, and then when he’s home or resting use a futuristic wheelchair. I would then spend time at various points in the story talking about the downside of exo/stim, ie it’s painful, causes bruising, has to be recharged, is clunky, takes time to put on in the morning, the shocks are exhausting, takes too much mental energy, and so on.

An exo could be interesting because when it’s removed (or runs out of battery, or hit with an EMP, or a servo explodes), he would be completely immobile and at the mercy of who/whatever affected the device.

A stim could be more useful if the disability isn’t central to the plot. For example if he’s home and in his wheelchair and someone breaks in, with an exo he’d be fucked because it would take him ten minutes to put it on. With a stim, all he has to do is activate it (however) then get up and run away.

The exo is something I’ve played with a bit, and it can be fun. But if you’re writing hard/crunchy SF, it’s near-future only for this use case. Paralysis will be “solved” before too long, and exos have too many downsides to be the preferred solution. ",,,3,0,0,

Once again, the author ignores those of us existing on federal disability. I, for one, am tired of being ignored. We have all heard the complaints about those who are faking it to take advantage of the system. I don't deny it is possible, but my experience proved getting SSI was no picnic. Moving on from us second class citizens, every time you raise the minimum wage you devalue the dollar. The problem isn't at the bottom. The problem is the top. We need to reign in greed and create a maximum wage. There is no excuse for someone making more money than they could spend in ten lifetimes. Why in hell should a guy get $15M for throwing a ball around when a guy swinging a sledgehammer can barely feed his family?  Reigning in greed also means controlling profits. Bigger profits aren't a sign of success... unless you are celebrating the success of screwing the consumer. Costs need to be brought back down from the stratosphere. If all you do is continue to raise the minimum, costs will continue to outpace earnings and the dollar won't be worth shit. Finally, AOC has it right.

Able-bodied people may be turned off by playing a disabled character, but as a stand-alone, they would only have to buy it if they so choose. It could prove to be a valuable tool in teaching the able-bodied what the disabled have to live with day to day. The moral view would dictate that it is the right thing to do.

I applied for and was hired for a transcriptionist position many years ago. Turned out, my desk was IN the lab. If I had any sensitivity to that, it would have been a no go. But, during the interview, the manager told me where I would be sitting and asked me if I would be ok. Assured me the hospital ventilation system was tip top. People working next to each other never even got sick when someone sitting next to them did. So go ahead and ask. Especially since it seems it's pretty much your field. If you were more specific about your role, I might be able to help more.

As for your POTS, there's nothing wrong with asking about sitting vs standing. You can easily explain both of these issues by saying you have allergies (the chemicals) and low blood pressure (the POTS). You don't have to present them at interview as disabilities.  

Every job I have held for the last 20 or so years has accommodated my disabilities without  me even knowing they were developing and that's because one, I was a great employee they wanted to keep and two, legally, they had to make 'reasonable accommodation' for me. It has never been an issue as long as I got my foot in the door first.

Now, when i fill out applications, I do answer yes to the do you have a disability question because many companies, especially larger ones, get tax breaks for hiring x number of people with disabilities so heck yeah I'm going to use that to my advantage. No one has ever asked me what my disability was so there was no need to reveal it. 

And I know you said you don't want to hear about switching careers but if you can't make the one you went to school for work for you due to illness, you're going to have to be realistic about that.

These days robotic exoskeletons are the technological cure - there are several models: ekso, ReWalk are two I can think of. I’d imagine in the distant future the robotic exoskeleton would become a robotic implant that replaces the connection from spinal cord to body and organs. Or maybe your character had a devastating injury like being crushed in an accident or something, and the robotic implant is their literal new skeleton. Keep in mind that scientifically speaking, robots aren’t just computers, a lot of the same tech advances are now being made using self-assembling biomaterials so that’s another mechanism that might fit for your story.

I think the cyberpunk theme gives you an opportunity to envision what paralysis or other disability looks like in that setting and time. Maybe paralysis was cured but the cure was highly technological (say, a robotic implant controlled by the techno overlords, whoever they are in your story) but came with too many risks or losses of freedom so your character chooses something DIY, like “hacking” their body with their own solution. I like the opposite too, where your character has the robotic “cure” for their disability forced on them (maybe they were unconscious?) so they go cyberpunk and hijack the robotic implant for their own purposes. 

Something else to keep in mind that most non paralyzed people don’t know is that paralysis from a spinal injury  affects a lot more than just mobility. Any body function controlled by spinal cord below the injury level is affected - bowel &amp; bladder function, sensation, etc. Little details like that can really make your story read as more realistic.

I'm coming up to being disabled for 10 years in May. I was totally healthy etc and collapsed when I was 12, ended up diagnosed with Transverse Mylitis and was bed bound in hospital for 6 months. I haven't walked since.

I've been where you are. I don't know the specifics of your condition, but just know that the advice I'm going to give you comes from someone who will never walk again.

I was a musical theatre performer before I collapsed. It was my dream to star in musicals and be on stage. This obviously ended as soon as I was diagnosed. So I know the hopelessness you must feel right now, not being able to do your job or run around with the kids.

I took things one day at a time. I started with basic things to take my mind off of everything. I was just reading some books. (At that time, I read the entire Twilight Series. I WAS 12 DON'T HATE ME.) I taught myself guitar and ukulele. Played a lot of games. After that, I started drawing. I now study graphics design &amp; illustration at university. I sew and make costumes for Comic Cons etc. It all depends on you. What you're interested in. But being unable to walk, or being bed bound does not mean your life needs to end.

Your wedding's coming up in April! Get a notebook and start writing everything you're looking forward to. What you're worried about, what you're planning to do, what you expect married life to be like. I guarantee it'll be really fun. I'm not married, but I'm engaged. I'll be going down the aisle in a wheelchair. And you know what? I couldn't be prouder. I've worked so hard to be where I am today. And I'm excited to get married. You deserve it. I'm sure your partner thinks the world of you and would do anything to make your day special. Speak to them. Whatever you need, whatever you want to make it the best day of you life, I know your partner will want to do whatever you need.

The last thing I'm going to say is this:

When I was in hospital, my mother and I made a deal that we'd never feel sorry for ourselves. I didn't want sympathy. I didn't want pity. Sure, every now and then I get down and think ""Why me?"" or ""I wish I was normal."" But then I tell myself that you can either sit in the corner and sulk, letting the world pass you by, or you can get up and get on with your life. You can do anything anyone else can do. You just do it in a different way.

&amp;#x200B;

Which leads me to what are you interested in? What are you passionate about?

What do you need to do to make those things a part of your life?

You have medical issues, sure but what you have that's even more crippling is small town issues.

Small towns are great for parents and little kids. They're great for retirees. They're great for teachers and school staff. They're great for self-employed business folks and professionals that can work from home or old homes that are converted to offices. And they're great for commuters or telecommuters. 

They are not great for people that don't know what they want in life or people that cannot work in the narrow group of jobs they provide.

If you truly cannot leave your small town you are in then you know more than the we internet strangers about what your options are.  You just need to figure out how to specifically make those jobs viable for you.

&gt;the design of the joystick controller as a whole has begun to suck

I love that comment and this link to the R-Net modules is incredibly useful. I looked at the page and I can see, immediately, why you think simpler is better and I agree. I notice there is the ability to have up to ""fifteen modules"", but it may be excessive to do so. Personally, I would be overloaded.

Everything you are saying is absolute gold.

I would be so grateful if you could elaborate on this ""mechanical"" mode you have mentioned. I think I know what you mean about the scroll wheel.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;(Do not make this ""all, auto, or nothing, no in-betweens,"" please. I like being able to toggle everything at will, not rely on sensors or ""machine learning."")

For my own control system I am working on a type of blended control, one that switches between teleoperation / joystick contol and autonomy. This would be a varying degrees though. Regulating speed is one of these factor, so if a narrow space is in front of the user, then the wheelchair **could** slow down whilst navigating through. At these stages it will move to joystick control, to allow the user a sense of control. Once through, the wheelchair **could** switch to semi autonomy (object detection and avoidance, while the person steers) and it **could** even switch to full automy and navigate to the desired location if possible. So if there is a regular journey, which someone navigates to on a day to day basis, the wheelchair will just assume to go to that point (unless the user does not want this, then teleoperation takes over). It's more of a navigational aid than completely reevaluating the control system.

&amp;#x200B;

I completely agree with what you are saying and I think it is important to allow people the freedom to decide what the wheelchair actually does. I want to make something that is optional, blended (to be almost natural) and fully autonomous (if desired).

&amp;#x200B;

I really like what you said about the trip odometer and battery relationship. I think something like this would be amazing, especially if it were to display how much battery consumption would be used while navigating to a certain point. I think, in simulation, it would not be hard to create something that is representative of battery life to then have it drained a certain amount when X metres are covered. I am going to seriously consider this.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I hate this trend of ""make a noise when you turn something on."" No one else's feet sing a song to declare they're moving.

Haha, ok. I did not plan on implementing any sound. Out of interest, if you could have any sound, what would it be? I would probably change it depending on my mood. One set jingle though? Constantly? That would drive me a bit mad.

It sounds like you regularly receive unearned income. Social Security rules require you to report any income received by the 10th of the following month. For unearned income, after a $20 disregard for any type of income, they reduce your SSI payment dollar for dollar. For example, if I won $100 playing poker in January, I report this now to SSA at the beginning of February, and my March payment is $80 less. When you do report regular but fluctuating income, make sure the representative at SSA knows that the amount of money received is different each month, to avoid a misunderstanding or error in payments, since SSA representatives sometimes enter reported income as a flat recurrent amount instead of a one time payment or fluctuating amount unless you make this clear to them. There are different rules for earned income. See this PDF on Working while disabled, the sections on SSI, from SSA [https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10095.pdf](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10095.pdf). 

People who receive SSI usually have to go to SSA for an annual financial review. Their rules require you to truthfully report all income, resources and changes in living arrangement. They will look at your bank accounts (and paypal) over the past year, as well as any changes to your living situation, income and resources. If you have large cash withdrawals, they may want to see evidence that money was spent (as opposed to hidden under a mattress, which by their rules you are required to report any cash you have). To avoid problems with this, I recommend keeping receipts or other documentation for any large cash purchases (like any cash purchases over $200) made after large cash withdrawals (around $200 or more).  For example if I withdraw $500 in cash to buy a laptop from someone on craigslist, I save the listing and our emails agreeing to the exchange and bring that to my annual financial review.

For any month that your total resources are above $2000 (such as any month when the combined balance of your accounts goes over $2000), SSA deems you ineligible for SSI for that entire month. To avoid overpayments, I strongly recommend keeping your total balance always below $2000.  At the beginning of any month when your total resources are above $2000 (bank accounts, cash on hand and other countable non exempt resources) you are deemed ineligible for the entire month. Social Security generally applies a First of the Month rule when determining countable resources. See [https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0501110600](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0501110600).

Some resources are exempted from the resource limit, such as funds in an ABLE account up to $100,000 or certain money set aside as part of a Plan to Achieve Self-Support  (PASS) see [https://www.ssa.gov/disabilityresearch/wi/pass.htm](https://www.ssa.gov/disabilityresearch/wi/pass.htm). If you are interested in saving money for certain educational, vocational, assistive technological, and other expenses, I recommend check out ABLE accounts if you were found disabled by SSA before age 26, or to check out the PASS program. 

If you receive help from others for food or shelter expenses, SSI counts this as income. They call it In kind Support and Maintenance. If you are paying for your own share of food and shelter expenses, they may want verification of your arrangement, especially if you are living with family members. If you receive discounted rent (pay below fair market value) for housing rented from friends or family, SSA rules also count this as income. SSA may ask for verification or documentation of current living arrangement, including a rent agreement or rent receipts, or may give you a form for your landlord, or the person you pay rent to, to sign.

That's also great because you can inspect the chair before buying it. I think I paid about $600-700 for mine, plus a few hundred on new tubes/tires, a cushion, and a few replacement parts. Be aware that buying a used chair might mean that some of the parts need replacing/fixing, and this can sometimes be a challenge if the model isn't sold anymore.

Tilite or Quickie are great brands since they're lightweight and high quality; a titanium frame is best.  I'd recommend getting the narrowest chair you can fit into. You also probably want an adjustable model so you can play around with the seat height, center of gravity, etc. and figure out what works best for you.

One example, that didn't involve me, he called my gf at work to talk to her about a letter he'd received from my therapist. We both knew what was on that letter. He said he had the letter in front of him. He lied about what was on the letter and tried to convince my gf, while she was at work, that the letter said things that it didn't. Finally, when she wouldn't accept his version of it, he admitted that it didn't actually say that. 

He also was rude to my therapist to the point she wanted to make sure that this was actually the examiner and not someone impersonating one. Maybe you guys don't normally get emotionally invested, but I think this one did.

I was going to write a letter about his conduct to his superiors, regardless of his decision. Unfortunately, he has retired, so there would be no point.

""Given the slope of the site obviously it would be unrealistic to expect everything to be perfectly flat however the off shoot paths have alot of pavers that are uneven, which poses a trip hazard to walking patrons but from my perspective catches the front castors of a wheelchair which can cause it to tip forward (and I'd then end up on the ground). Another major issue with this area is the camber/slope of much of the path which makes it alot harder to propel a manual wheelchair and means that no matter how hard you try you are constantly fighting to stop the chair from pulling towards the gutters. Which not only uses a lot of extra energy but is potentially dangerous as it again poses a tipping risk.One thing that is often underestimated is the amount of energy it takes to propel a manual wheelchair and slopes, uneven surfaces etc only increase this amount.


My main issue was that when I got the accessibility map at the kiosk near the main entry, the lovely lady I spoke with informed my friend and I that we could use the Sky Safari to bring us back up to the top. Unfortunately when we arrived at the pick up point we were then told that the wheelchair was too wide to load into the pod and that it would have to collapse and I'd have to transfer in. Luckily I'm able to crawl on my knees and we broke down my rigid frame chair as much as possible, if this wasnt the case then we wouldnt have been able to use the service. This is perhaps my biggest concern over the course of the day. I'm lucky that I was able to board in this manner however a lot of other wheelchair users would stuggle as there is no way to get the wheelchair next to seat for a simple transfer. The wheelchair that I use is not overly wide and while understand there are limitations with infrastructure, it seems a bit ridiculous that the type of service that would massively benefit someone using a chair is also very difficult for them to use. I would suggest that this size limitation needs to be clearly conveyed to wheelchair users BEFORE they descend the hill, because if they are unable to safely transfer to take advantage of the Sky Safari the main hill is a very steep slope to have to be pushed back up to get to the exit.""

Also just general things like making sure that the transitions between footpath and ramps are level and don't have lips for someones foot/wheelchair castor to get caught on. For places that have cafes/restaurants making sure there are tables that are accessible and leaving enough room between tables to allow wheelchair users to navigate easily.

4db716d6-e462-4853-86cf-4c23c65bf80a,1550775476,"TLDR: Had horrible relationships that nearly broke me after cancer disability, but finding someone who understood my issues happened when I least expected it.

Before I was lucky and fortunate enough to fall in love with and marry a childhood friend, dating as a disabled person nearly broke my spirit, so I empathize. 

I had yet to come to terms with the fact that I was unlikely to return to work following my battle with leukemia, as well as getting reacquainted with my body. It had changed remarkably due to tumors, surgeries, and chemo and it just.... no longer felt like ME. I'd dropped massive amounts of weight, short hair, and had scars that made me incredibly self conscious. 

I dated a couple of guys prior to my husband and each was worse than the last. There were snide comments about my skin hanging off my bones (I'd dropped 100ish lbs in approximately 6 months)  and how I ""looked better"" in my photos where I'd had long hair (I always made it clear that those were ""before"" photos as I had no interest in tricking anyone). There was very little empathy regarding my ever present fatigue and constant jokes/eye rolling about my chronic intestinal distress. The relationship that lasted the longest saw me move with the guy for nearly a year. That year nearly broke all faith I had in ever being an equitable partner in a relationship.  Every time he wanted to hurt me in order to ""win"" an argument, he knew exactly what to say. 

I heard:
""I'll never marry you because your kids will be genetically flawed since YOU had cancer.""
""You could be SO pretty if you only worked out.""
""You're just a drain on society since you're on disability."" 
""Ugh, your scars weird me out! They feel weird when I touch them!""
""I now understand how fit, attractive guys can be with kinda bigger girls - they know she isn't going anywhere because she feels lucky to have a hot guy. And you're a good girl... and you're KINDA pretty. I guess I can be with you for now.""
And he flat out called me handicapped and broken on several occasions. I found out after the fact that he was sexting nearly every girl in his phone and physically sleeping with every single one he had ever seen in person. 

He was emotionally abusive in nearly every way and I regret every moment that I didn't realize that I deserved better. After I got the strength to walk away, I was broken. I wanted to be alone for awhile. A few days later, an old friend asked me out and I agreed - as friends. Two weeks later, we had our first date. March, we will celebrate our 8 year anniversary of said date. He helped me put myself back together with empathy and understanding because he had major back and neck issues that had led to him taking a disability LOA and his mom, too, had medical issues.  Our first time being intimate, he gently kissed and thanked each of my scars, saying ""Without these, you'd not be here.""

I'm a firm believer that once you find the right person, disability is just another thing that you contend with, but doesn't define you. Find someone who kisses your scars - both the physical and emotional ones. And settle for nothing less because you deserve it. ",,,11,0,0,

They made sure to signal to me where to go and really made sure I was safe but also had a good time.

You really should have a disability attorney. They will not ask for money up front; they will only take your case if they think you will win, because they get their fee from the payment you will get when you're reinstated.

Personally, I would not go before a disability judge without one. The attorney would make sure to have all of your medical records, or obtain new ones, for the judge to have all the best information possible.

If you have one already, just listen to what the attorney says.  

If you don't, make sure you have all of your medical records well organized for the judge to go through, if they need.

Raynaud’s disease is when your body constricts blood vessels in your extremities, most commonly hands and feet, due to cold (not even that cold really, like 65 is sometimes cold enough for me to have an attack), quick drop in temp (like going from 100 degrees outside into a grocery store) or stress. Usually this means your hands, fingers, feet or toes will turn white due to complete lack of blood flow or blue/black from lack of blood and oxygen. Like frostbite. Blood will never pool or cause you to turn purple if you have Raynauds. But it does sound like you have a circulation issue of some sort that needs to get checked out. If you are still concerned it may be Raynauds, I’d recommend finding a Rheumatologist because Raynauds is considered an autoimmune disorder. There are some Rx meds that help some people with the disease, but staying warm and dry and stress free are the only “natural” ways to keep it at bay.",,,2,0,0,

f4d18fa8-4341-4c9e-9b7b-df64934a1b8c,1549864468,"I'm not sure in Canada is the same as Australia but when you apply for disability here the first thing they ask is ""what treatments have you tried, what treatments are you currently doing?"" and if you can't give them a long list, the answer is ""Well if you aren't treating your illness, we can't confirm your illness is disabling you, It could just be a lack of treatment disabling you""

They don't care that sometimes you need money to afford the treatments in the first place.

I actually have a lovely letter from my government that reads ""We can not exempt you from your work requirements as we have determined your incapacity to work is not temporary"" That is to say, I am not eligible for our version of ""Temporary Employment Constraints"" because the government agrees my illness is permanent and I need to go through the disability sector not the employment sector, But without a treatment plan, I can't access disability services. I don't have a treatment plan because I am still on the waiting list to see a specialist who can diagnose me with something more specific than UCTD - because the government did not accept that diagnosis nor did they accept ""physical therapy"" as a treatment because they said ""well how is that going to treat your fatigue? you listed fatigue as one of the disabling symptoms but you're clearly doing nothing to treat that"". (In my case, I curremtlky work ~6 hours a week casual, which works out to about $600 a month (AUD) which is not a livable wage (the dole is $1160 a month and Disability payments are a little more than that - I don't want a full disability cheque, I like working, i'd just like to supplement my income as I can't work more hours without getting sicker)


The first step is to go back to your doctor and outline what you need. If the pshycologist you spoke to says you need a medical team, then you need a medical team, ask your doctor how you can go about building that on your current budget - what services are available to you as a welfare recipient to access medical care, can he document a care plan that you can take to the department that manages disability.

If you are not in a state to work because of your illness, and you are treating your illness as best you can, then why are you asking of you deserve disability? You have a disability and it's making it impossible to work right now? if that's the genuine truth then that's your answer, you are entitled to it.

Whether or not the government approves you is another question, there are many people who are morally entitled to disability support/services/welfare who don't get approved because of bureaucracy. ",,,2,0,0,

I hate that I can’t plan a future or even a vacation.

I hate how much I try to compensate for whatever crash is next and never feel like I’ve given back as much as I should.

I hate that I’m not grateful.

I hate that I’ve spent so much time being depressed that even when I’m not struggling with depression, suicide ideation is just a routine thought. Even on great days my mind will think “this would be a good day to die”. And then the moments of joy are clouded. 

And on bad days how my mind’s first reaction is “well if it gets worse you can always kill yourself”

I hate that the availability of death provides more comfort than the hope of an afterlife and my faith do anymore.

I hate that I can’t change the way my mind works.

I hate that I can’t be more helpful to others.

I hate that I hate myself because of all the above.

And I miss running. Not like exercise running/jogging, but running like a kid, as fast as I could, for no real reason, just because it felt freeing. I miss freedom.

I hate that I’ll never be able to take my dogs up the mountain on a hike.

But one thing I like is the bravery and voice of other disabled people. I’m learning to not keep praying for healing but to pray for healing of my heart. And I am blessed to be able to offer empathy to others sometimes. I’m blessed that there are others out there who get it, and I don’t have to explain.

I’m grateful for all of you.

Keep fighting.

Please. 

Keep being the best you that you can be.

And tell the voices of doubt in your head to shut the fuck up sometimes.

You are strong even on the days you hate your hated parts more than ever.

The whole ""unnecessary radiation"" thing is suspect. There's more radiation exposure in the average flight over 1 hour than you'd get in a year's worth of x-rays. You are also 18, which means that as far as your anatomy is concerned, you are an adult, meaning x-rays won't have any difference in effect on you than they would on any other adult.

so as i said in my very first post, if they are guardians or caretakers or have legal responsibility for your welfare, they can be charged and end up in jail if they dont and if that is the only way to get you to do that then that may be why they do it that way. if i could ask you to go take a shower every day and you did then yeah, theyre going to far, but if i ask and as already stated, you respond with ""nah, id rather not"" every time, encouragement isnt working

my point behind all of this is sometimes you have to force normal behaviors. if youre depressed and dont want to ever get out of bed there comes a point where its not acceptable.

and hygiene is important its more than just smelling good, yeah youve got mental health issues but that doesnt mean you have to accept the physical health issues.

another story. my grandma had mental health issues and cleanliness was an issue. in all areas. she didnt take her dog outside so the dog would shit in the house and shed leave it, never cleaned anything, rats invaded. she put rat poison in the fridge even. but more importantly, she cut her foot somehow. it got infected, she got gangrene, her leg had to be amputated. she didnt take care of the surgical site, got a blood infection and died. because my parents ""encouraged"" her to take care of herself but didnt force it.

so folding clothes doesnt matter, i dont give two shits about that, putting away laundry, dont give a shit about, but showering, changing your clothes, brushing your teeth are important and if they have to force you to because of past actions- taking the option of ""nah dont feel like it"", then you cant resent them, you cant hold it against them.",,,1,0,0,

I was a Medicare/caid service provider in my career, and became a recipient of services (including SSDI) at a relatively young age, so I'm familiar with the system from both sides. I think it's possible to acknowledge a person's feelings about an interaction without certifying that their interpretation is correct, and also possible to suggest they are mistaken while still validating their feelings. 

In all likelihood, the social security examiner wasn't out to get them. But it's a bad policy to say, ""all our examiners are good. If you report one for any impropriety, we will not believe you, because you're stressed by this process and unable to see clearly."" That's bad for the person you're talking to and for the precedent you set for everyone else who heads or reads it. I suspect you'll say I haven't represented your remark fairly, but I present to you the possibility that this is how your remark will be *taken* by some applicants.

I use the example of the murderer physician because it's a great example of a situation where people's suspicions are not believed, because who would believe a doctor of all people would be murdering and possibly getting away with it right under people's noses?

My condition leaves me in period of times bed bound, and I understand the frustration.

I guess that there is an attitude that using aids is giving up; but if they are part of an overall plan that includes effective pacing (with help from the professionals involved) then they become the things that help you get just a little bit more out of life.

In my head, life is for living. If aids help you live it, why not. Just make sure you have a plan to keep yourself as fit and mobile as possible.

People love to put these ideas out that somehow your views on yourself influence other peoples views on you and it’s simply untrue. I love people who hate themselves, and i hate myself and am loved by people. Why is that different all of a sudden for dating? Do you wanna look through the conversations i have on dating profiles? I know how to talk to people, i don’t say i think it’s gonna go bad, i try to make a good impression and carry conversation and do everything i should. It just always fails, usually around the time I mention I’m disabled and can’t drive.

You may be able to request a continuation of benefits pending your appeal if you ask for a continuing benefits within 10 days of receiving the notice (or sometimes later if you have good reasons for not requesting it sooner). If a request for continuing benefits is granted, but SSA ultimately determines you are not disabled, they may charge you with an overpayment.

Based solely on your description it sounds like you may not be entirely medically stable for extended periods of time and not necessarily consistently able to maintain gainful employment due to your conditions. If so, appealing the denial may be a solid option. 

Appealing the decision does not forfeit your right to try to work and support yourself. You can appeal and try to get a job or work. If you are able to successfully return to work and consistently earn above $1220 per month for extended periods, then you may not be medically eligible anymore. If you are unsuccessful in your efforts to return to work, that can be used as affirmative evidence of disability in your appeal. 

Having current treating doctors available to provide additional information and documentation about your conditions and work related limitations can be very helpful in establishing and maintaining medical eligibility. If you are not currently seeing a doctor or therapist who you feel is providing you with effective treatment and has an accurate understanding of your conditions and limitations, you could look for another provider.  

The continuing disability review process can take a very long time especially if you exercise your appeal rights.

To me, it seems a bit odd that one person is responsible for one thing only, and I don't feel like it's entirely fair to make the disabled person pay for something just because the person that's leaving had that task.
Ask them what they would be capable of, and maybe try to distribute all tasks evenly between all of you. If you have 10 tasks and the disabled person can do only a few, then just let them do that all the time and spread the rest between the other people. If the person can do neither, I guess asking them to do something else for you would be okay. I'm not sure about the scholarships etc though, seems more like a personal thing for you to do.

Personally, I love the system we have at my dorm. We have 8 people though.
Everyone has a set day (mon-thu, weekends are up to you) where they cook. Your responsibility. Dishes are done by whoever hasn't done it for the longest time. 
There's ""sets"" of chores, that set has to be completed in one week with a set date (we have a printed list). The sets rotate, so every week someone else will be doing that task set. In our case that means each person has a task set to complete once every 8 weeks, but we only have kitchen tasks since we're all responsible for our own room/bathroom. You could have more task sets though, in your case making sure a few of them are fully accessible.
(example- 
kitchen set 1: clean microwave, wipe clean all kitchen surfaces, clean stovetop, check shared fridge and throw out expired items, do house laundry (kitchen towels, wipes), fold and store away)

It's just an idea, but I've found that it's a great way to be organized and get things done. If you miss your task set deadline, you get the house a cake.",,,10,0,0,

We started every training session by getting people to write down 2 things on cards ""What do you picture when someone says 'disability'?"", and ""what accommodations would you need to make in your workplace if your new hire has a disability""

We'd then put them in a tub and pull them out to read anonymously and talk about why it is/isn't a good answer.

The most common thing people picture when they hear disability is ""wheelchair"" which we explained isn't the best thing to picture because of the 5 million people in our country living with a disability, only 4.4% use a wheelchair, we'd then talk about the WHO 5 categories of disability (mobility, sensory, neurological, psychological, and learning/intellectual) and how many conditions are considered disabilities because they have overlaps, and how some conditions only cause disability due to a social model not a medical model (eg, certain circadian rhythm disorders don't effect people until you ask or expect them to work at a schedule their body doesn't run on, only then do they experience limitations in their abilities)

The most common answer to how to adjust their workplace was always something like ""make sure the lift works"" or ""get a ramp installed"" and we'd always throw back the question ""what's a ramp going to do to help someone with a hearing impairment hear your P.A system?"" or ""How will a ramp help someone with a mental health condition?"", You can't know how to make something more accessible until you know the accessibility needs of the people you want to engage with. We'd then talk about the importance, but also the limitations of universal design (eg: Well lit spaces are important for visual impairments but could be a barrier for people with photosensitivity or sensory overload issues)

Most of the time the misconception stems from the fact that many disabilities are invisible, and that **in able-bodied spaces the word ""disability"" has taken on a binary meaning**.  I would ask the classes to raise their hand if they've met someone with a hearing impairment or a visual impairment. I think I saw maybe 5 or 6 hands in my whole time running the training over the 60 companies I addressed, so I'd ask again ""really? No one here has to speak up for their grandparents because their hearing isn't so great?"" or better yet ""Really? half of you are wearing glasses, is that just for fashion?"".  Often the class would reply with ""Yeah, but I can still work, I just need glasses, I'm not disabled because of my visual impairment so it's not a disability"" or ""Oh, yeah, but old people all have bad hearing, it's not a disability, it's just age""

I loved posing the question ""If you left your glasses at home, or they broke during the day, could you continue with your day as normal?"" when most people answered ""no"" i'd ask ""How is leaving your glasses at home not creating a disability for you, but  someone in a wheelchair trying to get into a building with no ramp does have a disability? You both have issues that could be solved with simple tools. Disability is a spectrum, it's not a gatekept society that you can only be a part of if you have incredibly serious or drastically limiting conditions."" 

Trying to explain that their fundamental understanding of what a disability is was in fact flawed took half the class. So many people assumed that the word ""disabled"" meant ""You can't do things"" or ""You need a carer"". They were living in this outdated idea that disability=invalid.",,,9,0,0,

I always try to swim in the lane that best matches my speed capabilities and I don't rest at the end of the lane, I get out to rest, or move out of the lap lanes (this is an option at my main pool).

Not sure if this is an option for you, but I schedule my swim days/times for when the pool is generally least crowded.  This mostly is to keep me from getting stressed.

I periodically swim in a pool that is very small and I stick to the child/family lane there as I definitely would hold up any regular swimmer.  It's actually a bit of a pain for me as I have to go around people or watch out for running into children, but I'd personally rather do that then deal with holding up other swimmers.

Or, are you inexperienced to the point that you don't know a writer only includes what is needed in a story? (which is totally fine - I'm not trying to shame you for being young!)

It IS a good opportunity to learn more about the subject of disability, but you have that opportunity every day, in the real world, and you haven't taken advantage of that to this point in your life, so you come on Reddit to ask a faceless community for information to bridge a gap in a story you haven't actually worked out yet. It's lazy, which makes me question the genuineness of your intent, as well as your inclination to actually learn about this subject and give it the respect it deserves. You can't shortcut your way to truth and authenticity.

The fact that you're aiming to include a diverse character without having a reason for it reeks of commercialism and marketing. I'll trust that wasn't your actual intention, and I do understand that this has (increasingly) been an issue for the younger artists in the last few decades, but that's why I'm suggesting you re-think this idea of yours. Don't fall victim to the pressures of the market. Don't add character-based marketing elements to the artistic realm of storytelling. Don't add diversity for decoration. Only write what is necessary.

Why is a disabled character necessary, especially if it's not a main theme in the story?

So if your physical impairments are more than minimal, then it is considered a ""severe impairment""?

If she is found to have moderate physical limitations, they are considered ""severe impairments""?

She cannot walk for more than thirty minutes, she can't carry/lift 30 lbs for more than 10 seconds without her fingers hurting, she can lift 20 lbs and somewhat carry it (but not for long at all), and she can carry 10 lbs surely. She can't lift her right hand above her head without being in pain. Her hands are in pain in the cold, she thinks she might not have proper circulation. She in no way can go up stairs in a moderate pace, she has to take breaks and go slowly. She also becomes imbalanced when things are moving beside her, she says it might be vertigo. She also has sudden blind spots that block her vision infrequently, making her have to rest for a while because she panics due to her anxiety.

She has never had a complete physical evaluation determining these things though, they actually never scheduled one weirdly. She has only had a pap smear, blood work, and an electrocardiogram (which all came out relatively fine).

She has been prescribed medicine for hypertension and panic attacks, but I don't know if she was diagnosed with it chronically. She also might have diabetes (she was prescribed diabetes medicine and is still receiving blood sugar strips) according to her medical record. She never went in for another test because she started to diet because she was scared. 

If these are all validated by a doctor, would these be considered ""severe impairments""?

I really don't mean to sound condescending here, because I understand that you're coming to this community in crisis and you really want an answer to *why* you feel so strange and different, but...is a tendency to be quieter and to listen when around new people such a ""bad"" thing?

I really don't mean to discount what you're struggling with, because it sounds like you're having a *lot* of anxiety about this, and obvious *that's* a bad thing. We don't want you feeling badly about who you are. But, for instance, if you were to meet someone who made eye contact, seemed friendly, but didn't have a lot to say at first, would you consider them a bad person? Because I wouldn't. I would think they were quiet, and I would think that's just fine. 

In fact, if I met someone who refused to make eye contact, didn't want want to be anywhere near me, and flat out refused to speak to me, I would think that they might appreciate some space, and that's just fine too.

It sounds like you're judging yourself a lot, looking at all the people around you doing something that you don't and wondering why you aren't the same. Everyone in this community knows that feel, it's a terrible feeling, and I'm so sorry that you experience it so often. I think you should start seeing a therapist, it does sound like you have some problems with anxiety and self-image. And by the way, that's just fine too. I'm pretty sure most people struggle with anxiety and self-image, we all need a little help sometimes.

To me, though, it doesn't sound like you have a disability. I don't think there's a thing wrong with you other than how upset you are by this. If you don't feel like talking when you meet new people, there's no reason why you should have to. A therapist can talk to you about tools you can use to help you be more social if that's something you would like to explore. If not, that's cool too. I like people who don't mind silences, most people talk about the most inane bullshit because they can't stand the quiet.

If you are seeing a doctor who can provide additional information to Social Security that addresses their criteria about medical conditions and work related limitations due to those conditions, that can be very helpful. 

The quantity of records is not necessarily as helpful as the quality. From my experience, records from doctors who are seen for the purposes of providing desired treatments are much much more helpful than records from doctors seen just because someone wants additional records for their Social Security case.

The slow pace of recovery and all the frustration that comes with it are common themes in our groups. So even though I've don't personally know what you're going through, I definitely can sympathize.

I try to remind my clients that recovery is a marathon -- NOT a sprint. It takes years. And yeah, that can suck.

I also remind folks that sometimes you aren't aware of the recovery you are having. You see yourself every day. Sometimes, you have to take a longer view. Instead of looking day to day, thinking about recovery over the span of a few months or even a whole year. What can I do now that was hard 6 months ago or a year ago? 

You may also need harder exercises! If you're still doing the same exercises, you may have plateued and need some new exercises, or a new approach. Ask your MD for a referral to a different therapist.

Last, are you going to any kind of stroke support group? It can be really healing to hear what other folks are going through. I know it seems like nothing to hear this from an internet stranger, but you are truly not alone. There are so many people who know what you're going through.

In Texas, (at least through my retirement in 2011) residential group homes, and other support services,  for people with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) are funded, primarily, through Medicaid, which has eligibility limits on a recipient's income and tangible assets. While Medicaid eligibility was not my focus while working with people with IDDs, I absorbed enough to know that putting eligibility in danger can lead to a host of problems.

I realize that every case is different, as are the people. Wage parity has long been an issue. If a person can earn enough to live independently, and is able, it's probably not a problem. 

Consider, however, a person who lives with aging parents (which is becoming more of an issue as the Baby Boomers age), and makes more than the Medicaid cut off. When the parents, who may have been providing support for Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) are no longer able to do so, what happens to the individual? Is there a mechanism whereby social work is provided to ease a possible transition to a group home, if needed? Would the individual have to take a pay cut or change jobs in order to lower their income? This could be incredibly demoralizing. 

tl;dr - I haven't looked at the changes imposed by the legislation. Will decent wages threaten a loss of Medicaid eligibility for those who need, or may need in the future, a Medicaid-funded group home or support services?

tl;dr for the above tl;dr - In my experience, legislators have a poor track record of addressing issues without unintended consequences throwing a monkey wrench into the best of intentions.

People have a hard time understanding what isn't tangible. If they can't see it, it's hard for them to grasp the concept. 

Another issue is lack of empathy. It's hard for people to imagine different circumstances to their own and what it may be like.

If you feel you are lazy, go volunteer. Get out of your head for a bit and volunteer where you can help. If you don't like people, try and volunteer with animals. This way you are doing something and you can try and see if the paranoia is really there or if you are lazy. I do not know if you are or aren't, but I figure volunteering is a great way to test the waters. You will also help others and feel better about yourself. 
Some disabilities are not seen from the outside. I have spinal injuries. You cannot see them. I found good posture allows me to keep walking. Remaining somewhat physical keeps me from losing the ability to walk. Thus, most people assume I am fine. I even had a manager once tell me ""just wear a back brace"". It is not that easy. Wish it was... 
My point is, we cannot always see the extents of someone's disability. Mental disabilities are tough because you many times deal with someone who just feels you need to pull yourself up by the boot straps. It doesn't always work like that. I do have PTSD, anxiety, depression as well. My family has always made it sound like I could just throw a switch and act the way they want me to - but it doesn't work like that and frankly, they just exacerbate my anxiety. I do not deal with them anymore. They are hurtful. 
Try volunteering. Don't go all out, but try 2 hours a week. Start small and build your way. If you then have severe paranoia over even giving 2 hours, you will know that you aren't lazy. You have crippling anxiety. If that is what you have - start learning healthy coping mechanisms.

bd74173e-3a5a-4875-8bab-d86704e19f24,1551220445,"Okay you're not understanding it correctly though. As you know, if a power wheelchair is in its drive-powered mode, the motor will lock up (brake) automatically when you stop pushing the joystick. In order to hand-push the chair, the helper person needs to push a lever, usually down low by the axles, to disengage the motor and let the wheels turn freely. There are also separate hand brakes, just a small lever that crimps into the tire.

Only there were too many incidents of helpers forgetting to set the brakes or re-engage the motors, so the victim rolled away into a ditch or whatever. As a result, the wheelchair companies have now all switched to a partial release, so that when you flip that lever you still have a lot of drag from the turned-off motors. For me, that means if my husband's chair were to die somewhere, I could not push him up the car ramp and get home to recharge it. 

My proposal is to have two levers at the handles, which (with the power turned off) the helper would squeeze to release the motors and therefore the brakes. It would be safe to allow a complete release, for easy pushing, because (like a deadman switch) if the helper lets go the handles they'll also let go of the levers and the chair can't roll by itself. 

If your kid wants to ride on the back, they can just hold on to the handles without the levers while daddy drives his chair.

Similar situations have happened to me a lot of times, and every time, I go directly over to them, and I smile at the kid and tell the kid that my legs are sick, that they don't work and that's why I have a smart chair that can roll around. I often also ask them if they want to push a few buttons and honk the silly horn and they love it. And poof!

You can't be taking a fist full of multivitamins every day for the rest of your life, it's shit. Take the things that really, genuinely help, and don't be afriad to throw the rest out. This will give you energy to welcome potentially new treatments, while if you're struggling just to manage what you have you don't have the ability to try new things.   


Space out your doctor appointments! I went to 2-4 doctors per week for two years and it seriously burned me out. Also burned through my savings, holy shit. Space that shit out.

Space them out, maybe try one per week or only every other week. Take a few months off if you feel overwhelmed. It's going to be okay, going to more appointments doesn't mean you'll get better faster. You will be able to advocate for yourself to your doctors better if you are feeling better, so rushing just means losing out on quality of care. It is okay to not be ""doing everything you can"" despite societal pressure. You are allowed to live your life while being sick without throwing every ounce of energy into treatment.

Best bet? find something you have a disagreement on, talk about it, and go from there.

ask her stuff like what shes looking for in a relationship or where she sees herself in 5 years.

You could avoid making a knee-jerk reaction where you have to doubt why you made the decision.

For context, I'd not want to be with a mental couch potato. You know the type, few opinions, no reasoning, no problem solving of any kind. that person has no permanent mental impairment, but I still wouldn't date them.

This is the tip of the iceberg too.

Is a person that is mentally impaired a partner with equal decision making status in a relationship?

If the impairment is sufficient enough to say the answer is no, the no must  be the answer to the relationship question.

Josh Sundquist, ""My Conversation with Children"" -- https://youtu.be/r7JK5AFjjvc

While it can be mortifying to parents, kids just don't have the social skills yet to know the appropriate way to ask. Really, they just want an explanation for the world around them. And they're willing to accept just about anything for an answer. ""Mommy, why is that lady in a wheelchair?"" ""Because some people need wheelchairs."" -- most kids will just go, ""oh, ok.""

Eventually, they'll likely reach the ""why"" stage, where they keep asking for more details. And at that stage, you could go into a brief explanation of disabilities. ""Some people have issues with their bodies that they were born with, or that came from an accident or after getting sick, and now they [have a limp, use a walker, are shorter than normal people, etc]."" 

I wear a prosthetic leg brace, and am getting my leg amputated this summer. When kids ask about it (usually just ""what happened to your leg""), I pretty much just say my leg got hurt, and they leave it at that. 

If I were in your shoes (and I don't mean for this to come off as rude, just sincere), I would explain to your kid as best you can about volume control, or using an ""indoor voice"" and ask you up close if they have a question about someone else. ",,,14,0,0,

When I had this same issue for a long time after a surgery I tried a bunch of things that didn't work, so I decided to focus on getting more out of the liquids I was able to drink. I had good results from products designed for rehydration after sports, illness, or hangovers. But only the healthy ones with no sugar or artificial colors/flavors/sweeteners. Things like Gatorade make it worse with all their sugar (which the body must use more fluid to process fully) and artificial ingredients. Tried Pedialyte too, but same sugar issues, tastes icky, and is too pricey.

The very best were Nuun tablets, which you drop into water. They have lots of different flavors, and have a hint of effervescence at first, so without trying I found I easily drank more overall. Some of the flavors, like grape, fruit punch, or watermelon, I adore because they remind me of yummy childhood drinks that were terribly unhealthy. But the Nuun tablets have natural fruit flavors, and are sweetened with monk fruit, so just healthy stuff. They have lots of electrolytes, and some vitamins/minerals that help your body retain more fluid. I buy them by the box on Amazon, and they have sampler boxes that let you try several flavors first. Many healthier markets carry them too, at a higher cost, so you can try them first  Wish they were cheaper in general, but nope. :-( 

This is the nuun site for more info: https://nuunlife.com/. And here is an example of a combo pack on Amazon (but if you search for Nuun, you will see all sorts of packs and prices): https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B019GU4J56/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_FoIDCbQ5RF68G. Just avoid the nuun tablets with black packaging, as they have caffeine in them.

If you go on Amazon and search for ""hydration,"" the first batch of things that comes up will give you some really good options.

I also tried this concentrated rapid rehydrating liquid called LyteShow Electrolyte Concentrate that you can add to cold drinks, which worked well, but the Nuun tablets were much more practical (lightweight instead of heavy bottles of liquid, and more tasty, and cheaper).  https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00EISFBYA/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_qMIDCbC6MJP1S

I also switched to pink salt then, as it has tons of trace minerals (needed by the body to fully utilize your fluids), and that helped, surprisingly. Also just tastes much better! On bad days where I was almost fainting, I would take a mouthful of water and toss back a big pinch of that salt. It reduced the dizziness. But after that I began using the nuun tablets, which helped all around.

I ate as many juicy foods as I could then, like citrus, cucumbers, melon, lettuce, apples and pears. But I could barely eat at the time, so it wasn't enough by itself.

Switch to a really high quality multivitamin too, especially if your hair is falling out (mine did too). Avoid gummy vitamins, cheap stuff from the drug store, and brands known to source unregulated ingredients from China (like the NOW brand).

I hated the smell of my tap water which didn't help with drinking (and my city had good water), so I learned to fill a couple pitchers and leave them sitting out, uncovered, for 24 hours, which allowed all of the chlorine to evaporate.uch better then. 

Oh, kind of random, but I also started keeping the mini cans of V8 tomato juice on hand (regular kind, not the low sodium). Normally I don't like it much. But when I was so dehydrated, it tasted sooooo good for some reason. Probably I just needed the salt to help me better retain fluids, but the extra dose of veggies probably helped too.

I think that's all my hard-won hydration tactics, but it all worked. Hopefully something in there helps you, so you can start feeling better. If I think of anything else, I will wander back. Good luck, my dehydrated friend. ��

If you do not yet have an attorney and need additional time to obtain representation, SSA judges will generally grant you a postponement of hearing so that you can obtain counsel.

If you already have an attorney please disregard my general information and the rest of the general information here and consult with your attorney for specific advice about your case.

From my experience, the quality of evidence is generally much more important than the quantity of evidence in Social Security disability cases. If you have a doctor or therapist who you have seen on numerous occasions and is available to provide additional information about your conditions and work related limitations to the judge, that is generally very helpful. If Social Security does not already have an assessment by your doctor, the judge will generally grant you up to couple additional weeks to submit an assessment from your doctor and the judge’s office might have a form or questionnaire for your doctor to complete.

Your age is not necessarily relevant, especially if there is sufficient medical evidence that supports a favorable finding of disability.  If there is sufficient evidence to support a finding of disability based on SSA rules, then your age may or may not play a factor at all.

People who are older may be found to be disabled with less severe physical limitations than younger people, because SSA rules consider our age, work history, exertional limitations, and education/skills if SSA reaches the point in their determination of whether we can perform any competitive work.

I know there are a lot of invisible disabilities, so I would not generally question individuals on whether they are abusing a handicap plate or placard.  However, there are some instances where it is obvious, and I choose to speak up.  Recent example:

* Where a parent volunteering for a HS activity in a Mercedes SUV was seen using the HC spot to carry in boxes to set-up for a fundraising event, and proceeded to stay in that spot for at leat 3 hours.
* When, at the same event, I discovered a Land Rover in the yellow ""no parking"" areas between HC spots (1), preventing access to the cars legally parked in the HC spots (including my parents' car). My stepfather uses a wheelchair, so he was effectively prevented from entering his car.    
* Kicker---even worse, when I confronted the parent volunteer, she admitted that the Land Rover was her husband's car, and moved it. But she claimed that they were both entitled to use a HC placard because they had a qualifying grandparent accompanying them to the game.  (Two cars, one HC?  Really?) 
* Even worse--when my parents moved their car to leave, I discovered the Land Rover re-parked in my parents' vacated HC spot.  Again, two SUVs, two HC spots, two placards, and one person they claimed was with them who qualified for HC parking (whome I never saw or met).  
* At that point, I went bananas, threatening to call the police for abuse of HC placards.
* Fun fact--we have overlapping practice/game times with this team on an ongoing basis, and I am now the HC spot monitor.  And, I have all the parents on my team riled about about this, so I have a good watch-army, too.  I'm waiting, and I will catch her. 
* I am also planning to speak with the local police about this--although I think it's harder to challenge placard abuse.  Still--it's a town with not much crime, and if they can catch some HC violators, that's some good PD revenue.    

TL:DR--You're a selfish asshole, and I will call the cops if I think there is even a remote chance you will be ticketed.

If it was scheduled for you by disability determination here is some general information. 

In part due to the very low limit on how much SSA pays for these exams, they tend to be relatively brief and thus not as thorough or accurate as assessments from your own health care providers. If you are scheduled with a psychologist, (PhD, PsyD) they may conduct a short clinical interview, a brief symptom inventory and review of medical and behavioral health history, and may administer some clinical testing (for example tests of memory, concentration and cognitive functioning). If the exam is with a psychiatrist (MD), they often conduct similarly brief clinical interviews, symptom inventory and history, but typically use less extensive clinical testing. I recommend being honest and neither understating nor overstating symptoms, limitations and history. The assessment will likely be very brief, but you should take the opportunity to elaborate on what you feel are your most severe symptoms and how they most significantly interfere with your social interaction, daily activities and ability to perform tasks and stay focused (if applicable). 

If you have your own health care providers who you have seen on numerous occasions and who are available to provide additional information about your conditions (and how these conditions may limit work related capabilities) that addresses Social Security’s criteria, it is ideal to obtain information from them. You can contact the disability determination analyst who scheduled the consultative examinations for you and request that they send forms for your doctors or therapists to complete.

ddb10fbd-0647-48f3-9d8d-aa551bc1e850,1551179269,"Thanks a lot for your response.

I completely relate to the high steprail issue. Once I was in a wheelchair, non-powered, but in the kitchen there was this wooden block running along a partition between the, sort of, dining area and the cooking area. Getting over it to go back and forth to get coffee or tea was one of the most frustrating memories that has stuck with me. 

Luckily for me, this was only a temporary issue in an indoor environment. I am really interested in your specific problems, so is it something similar where at the base of the doorway there is this (literal) block that stops you rolling over and entering? Or is it something else entirely? I know doorways can be trouble enough with how narrow they can be.

So you are in a lift where the space is so small you are even unable to turn or even reach the buttons? That sounds like a terrible installation on behalf of the mall. No consideration to accessibility at all. 

With regards to the doors and the weight of them in general, I have got to say that I noticed this recently. It's something I had not considered sooner enough. 

How do you think this should be approached?

Do you think we are at a stage where they should all be automated or do you think it is appropriate enough to have them held open at all times? Perhaps by a wedge?

I wonder if the excuses for having such heavy doors closed relate to fire safety or something of this nature, not that is a good enough reason to NOT provide a solution.

I hope you don't mind me asking, but if you approached people about these situations, what is the general response? 

Sorry about all of the questions, I am genuinely eager to understand more. Not for the purpose of the project I am working on, but with the hope that this will further inspire me to do the best job I can. ",,,1,0,0,

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1550774257,"&gt; Moreover, your dismissive attitude is unnecessarily rude.

Do you want to be the kettle or the pot in the analogy? Do I know *every* examiner? No. But to say that there are people in the SSA/DDS world roving around just looking to deny or cease benefits is disingenuous. To compare perceived rudeness to murderers? c'mon man. 

There is an emotional disconnect sometimes between the DDS/SSA employees and the beneficiaries/applicants. I get that applying or dealing with a review is a stressful and emotional time. But sometimes that stress and/or frustration can lead to miscommunication or reading too much into things. It is very possible that the examiner was a little short with the OP, for reasons that had nothing to do with him, and OP perceives that as rudeness. People get upset at me constantly when I call looking for more information, and make the assumption that if I'm getting more info I'm just looking to trip them up or looking for info to deny them.  

All too often on this sub, DDS and SSA workers are vilified. Are there bad employees? Of course, you find that in *any* profession. But people all too often attribute things to malice rather than simple errors or even just someone having a bad day. There are a lot of layers of checks and balances within the system. Aside from some very specific situations, it is never one person who makes the decision and between 30-50% of cases are pulled for additional quality reviews. A DDS examiner is a stressful and thankless job that doesn't pay well, people don't get into the line of work just to screw with people.   

I give advice on this sub coming from an SSA/DDS perspective. Can it come across as harsh? Sure, but sometimes people need to hear the truth. I don't feel that I was being dismissive. I addressed all of his/her questions and concerns and gave additional information and advice.  ",,,3,0,0,

I would suggest checking out paraplegic YouTubers as they've given me lots of hints and tips. Paralyzed Living is a good youtuber to check out for good info for a para character. Also it'd be good for you to find someone with your character's specific vertebrae injury, ex: T12, T4-7, or L1, as all people with SCIs have different challenges and views! Paralyzed Living is T4 or T5 I think?? so basically anything below the armpits is paralyzed and he has challenges with things that involve core work whereas someone with a L1 is a pretty low injury and will have a decent amount of core strength.   


I can answer a few of your questions still being a wheelchair user but not specifically a person with a SCI.  


3. I absolutely loath when I am doing something I do day in and day out and someone asks me if I need help. Like transferring into my car today I had an elderly man ask if I needed help. Or if I'm going up a hill on campus and I'm just fucking tired so I take a break and someone asks if I want to be pushed. Nope. Don't wanna be pushed it's why I don't have push handles on my chair.   


4. Carpets are evil, your tires sink into it and sometimes spin and it's overall an arm work out when you have to be on carpet for a while. Tile is wonderful, so smooth, so sleek it lets you go real fast. Sidewalks are iffy to sometimes horrible. Cracks any bigger than your front casters (the front, small wheels of the wheelchair) you will fall into and inevitably faceplant out of your chair for anyone around to witness so swallow your pride and haul yourself back into your chair and continue on with life. AND not everywhere is accessible! So you have to learn how to pop wheelies, hop curbs, descend or pull yourself up stairs sometimes! Many wheelchair users can push shopping carts pretty damn well and if you get the hang of it you can also steer your chair by angling the shopping cart! Outdoors is pretty shit unless you have a FreeWheel, can hold a wheelie for long periods of time, or there's a paved path. Also sometimes people see you in a chair and just freeze for some reason and you have to steer yourself REAL quick out of their way because they just don't know how to act around someone in a chair for some reason?  


5. High school in my old chair was pretty okay I guess? Left class early to get to my next class, went to prom but used a cane for that. The cafeteria in HS was probably the worst because there was nowhere for me to sit in my chair. Ever. When I got my new custom my chair life went from a 3 to an 11 because I could push this new chair without pain and be seated for hours without pressure sores etc, and it's allowed me to actually go to college, have fun with friends, and has literally become a huge part of bettering my mental health and finding independence again.  


6. Being constantly jaded or angry with the world. Being helpless. Being strong 24/7. Being weak 24/7. A mix of all of these is fine!! But having one being their major personality traits? Not great.

When that got too much I started full timw using it up and walking down. It's become unsafe for me to do so, meaning I use it full time and yesterday was my first time using it going down. Since my shool probably had issues with kids just up and using it, I have an elevator pass and go to two ladies who have the keys, one of which is an ESE teacher and is super kind, and then theres the math teacher upstairs who is not so nice, and who I've heard yelling at children before. For two periods I ask neither of them as another girl has assistance going up and down so she has the key with the lady who helps her, and we ride together (Shes visibly disabled, so no one even questions her, which is nice). But this also meants two periods a day I have to talk to the other teachers until they make me a key, the ESE teacher is fine, but the upstairs lady.. oh god. Yesterday was the first time I went down, and when I go to ask for it she asks ""Do you have a pass? Because you dont look like you need this."" I just laughed awkwardly and showed her, and her clearly being lazy told me that house keys work on the elevator and just to use those. Sucks to suck because the same day me and Kayla got stuck downstairs because the lock was jammed because kids used house keys, meaning they changed the locks.
Today I go to her to ask, and turns out they didn't give her a key (Me and my mom may have kinda ratted her out to AP's) and so she said to me 'I cant help you. They changed the locks and didn't give me a key, so you're going to have to *walk down the stairs*."" If im using the elevator, maybe I can't safely go down the stairs..? Hmmm.. I had to have my mom cal the nurse to come get me because I can't use the stairs safely. A nice friend asked if she could help me down the stairs and I declined, and she offered to wait with me which im thankful for, but seriously, how is the other lady a teacher? Im hoping to get a wheelchair to help me with mobility, but living as 'able' bodied sucks. You'd think of all people teachers would understand..",,,1,0,0,

7923b1a9-81b8-424d-b994-4ca522623f74,1550184967,"Inspiration porn is annoying, but do you know what I find more annoying?  People who get way too offended by it.  It's really not that hard to avoid or just ignore.  Yesterday marked my 20th anniversary of being a paraplegic, and one of the many things I've learned is who gives a fuck?  It's embarrassingly taboo to not have some seething hate for inspiration porn and shit like that on this subreddit.  My main account is banned from here because I said too many people have a stick up their ass about it.  I wasn't insulting any particular person, I didn't attack anyone, I just said too many people are too touchy about it.  Some punk ass mod banned me and said, ""You're the one with the stick up your ass!""  Real fucking mature.  About a year later I messaged the mods asking if they would lift the ban and they never even responded.  Maybe this account will get banned too.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm paralyzed from the chest down and have used a wheelchair since I was 13.  I'm disabled and I'm entitled to my own thoughts on inspiration porn.  Not according to this subreddit though.  Like I said, after 20 years I've learned, who gives a fuck?  Most of it is done with good intentions.  These people aren't out to insult you and ruin your day, but so many disabled people in this sub act like someone came and shit on them just to put them in their place or something.  It's as eye-rolling as inspiration porn.  That's exactly what I do, roll my eyes and roll on with my day.  I cringe more at people getting pissed of at inspiration porn than I do at the porn itself.  I have a large family full of distant and not-so-distant relatives, we're mostly close, and they all truly love and care about me.  My grandma and my aunts aren't trying to shit on me when they post some wheelchair inspiration porn video on Facebook for me to watch.  It's embarrassing, but I humor them and move on.  

&amp;#x200B;

When you get so worked up about things like this, people continue to see you as disabled.  No one wants to be around the person they have to walk on eggshells around.  It's amazing how many people I have befriended who eventually tell me this.  About how their eyes have been opened to people with disabilities and how they no longer see them as disabled, but as individual people just like everyone else.  Obviously this doesn't work in every situation with every person you meet, but you break down more barriers when you're less guarded yourself.  


I'm entitled to my opinion, and you're certainly entitled to yours as well.  I'm just saying life is short, sometimes being disabled sucks, but when things do suck it's often from things that are out of your control.  Control what you can by not giving a shit about petty things so much, and I guarantee you life will be better for it.",,,1,1,0,

And the worst thing is that nobody believes me, as you describe, and they are very unwilling to challenge themselves over it and realise that most people typically feel uncomfortable around disabled people.

Yet I’ve had people tell me unprompted that when they met me they ‘didn’t think they could be friends with such a disabled person’! My loved ones have trouble seeing me through the lens of subconscious ableism and feel like I’m insulting *myself* when I say that it creates a social obstacle. 

I feel very deeply for those of you who have to struggle with the ‘when to tell’ game, which is a real no win situation. I have a life-limiting disease but my disabilities are now so visibly apparent that at least I don’t have to figure out how not to scare people off with the information.

I do believe it will get better with age as our peers have more familiar experiences with loss and illness and disability, either in themselves or their loved ones, but I’d like to have a youth too :)

Thanks for the vent, both ways—it helps to see this vocalised and know I’m not alone.

I don't like it, but by being disabled and knowing your limitations it's understandable that an employer wants more capable staff.  It's unfortunate that the company hasn't publicly discussed reasonable accommodations, but it's not surprising. What could they even offer to such a position with such physical and some times mental limitations?  As far as those employees, it's got to be hard constantly searching for better and better positions, because in a lot of cases people in these positions are unable to do much more than meeting and greeting.  But when you break it down this is what's happening to other classes of workers every day.  It's just not publicized as widely...because what could you even say?  ""Job Market Sucks, Water Still Wet - more on page 6"".  For instance take the elderly workforce, whether they're rejoining the job market or approaching retirement they're constantly being phased out by younger, usually  cheaper, or generally more capable workers all the time.

I get it.  I have EDS, POTS, MCAS and I’m disabled.  I worked in the medical profession prior to becoming disabled.  You can’t talk about your medical conditions while doing your job.  Your job was charting for physicians.  Your personal medical history has nothing to do with that.  There are many physicians who would be offended by a non-doctor/NP/nurse “schooling” them on a potential patient’s condition.  Hell, there are a few docs I know who would go to HR over a nurse doing that.

Scribes are meant to be seen and not heard.  Even chatting up doctors isn’t okay, much less doing it while talking about your medical problems.  It doesn’t matter what comments patients said about you.  You’ve got to learn to let that go.

An ER doc is behind from the moment they start work.  There is not enough time in a shift to listen to your impressions about a patient.  While you may perceive it as a “thoughtful discussion” the physician has to listen to this type of thing all shift from the patients and their loved ones.  I can guarantee the doc would have loved to get that precious time back and use it for sleeping, seeing the next patient, etc.

Yes, this sucks.  But it sounds like you were putting this job before everything else in your life - especially your own health.

I also used to be a rape crisis counselor/supervisor.  Behavior like yours during training, or (God forbid) the hotline would have caused me to immediately suspend, and then terminate the counselor.   Medicine is all about the physician/patient relationship.  You were inserting yourself into that relationship, and it wasn’t professional.  

You went from being suspended to fired due to the wall of text you sent HR in that email.  There’s something people call “word vomit” and you were doing it.  You can’t do that while at work.  And especially while working in an ER.  You essentially confirmed all their concerns about you.

I mean this in the best way.  Please consider getting some counseling to help you cope with your disabilities.  I really wish you the best with your life goals.",,,17,0,0,

Trust me, I’m fully aware of how cockiness expresses itself among professionals, and the entitlement that comes from working hard. I choose not to take that approach to my own success, but to each his own. (But hint: it’s kind of disgusting, from one hard-working professional to another.)

I don’t think you’re getting the legal point, which is that it’s not actually clear from what she wrote that she didn’t take the feedback from the audit, or that she had been reprimanded for chatting when patients weren’t around. It’s also not clear how the hospital treated other curious students who were behaving in similar ways. If she was fired for talking about “personal things” and not even reprimanded for talking about other medical topics that didn’t also happen to relate to herself, that’s a huge flag and it’s totally possible to see that as a firing that wouldn’t have happened *but for* her disability, i.e. if the same words had been said in the same probational context by someone who did not have EDS, that person would not have been fired for that behavior. It was punished because *she* said it, and it was only personal (as opposed to just curious) *because of* her disability. Do you get it yet?

The reason we don’t know enough to say anything accurate is because we don’t have the other facts that are extremely relevant to this case, including written rules of conduct, history of discipline (or lack thereof) of other people for the same transgressions, etc.

You don’t have to like that there are two sides to the story, but there simply are. Again, I’m not saying that HR people at the hospital won’t take a position similar to the one that you are articulating, but taking a position is not the same as being in the right (legally speaking).

You are describing the brutal reality of *why* they don’t give a shit about her and can replace her easily, but that doesn’t mean they can treat absolutely anyone however they want. Trust me when I say that absolutely ever employer who has ever lost a discrimination lawsuit felt like their actions were justified in the moment, and they were so convinced of it that they chose to go to court over it. But the judge or jury, following the law, obviously saw it another way.

98258667-73a0-442d-b8f7-98d4b4ad2629,1549052254,"I was pretty much where you are this time last year. Super depressed, developing agoraphobic levels of social anxiety, no friends, didn't leave the apartment for a year. I got fed up one night last March and started looking through meet up groups. Found one for fantasy writers, and spent the next week developing the courage to RSVP to a meeting. But I was 80 percent sure I was going to wimp out and didn't want anyone to know.

I had a panic attack in the parking lot before I crashed the meeting. The guy in charge wasn't upset that I didn't RSVP, and we were all there to talk about a specific thing that I was interested in so I didn't feel out of place. I didn't walk out that day with a new best friend, but I really enjoyed myself. It felt so good to talk to people, and it was so exciting to remember that I was interested in things, passionate even.

You're right, it does take time. I went to that meeting every week for three months before someone invited me for a drink at the bar next door after the meeting. We did that for another few months before I started meeting one of the people for coffee during the week. A few months after that I started playing roleplaying games with a group a couple times a month. I have *multiple* people who call me a friend that I hang out with pretty regularly, when this time last year I was calling the single chin hair I grow my best friend.

My point is, yeah, it gets time and work, but I really enjoyed the process. Even though it was terrifying. 

I do want to say something about your hesitations about just having disabled friends. I'm not mad about it or anything, I get it. But in that group of people I've met recently, I'm much closer with those that also have disabilities. My problems aren't visible, and I work hard to conceal my health issues, and I didn't know anyone else had disabilities. I just gravitated towards these people, and they gravitated to me. When we got closer and we started talking about health stuff together it was actually funny because we were both so ready to lose another friend because of our disabilities. He's my best friend, and one of the only people I can talk to in depth about my health problems. I'm so lucky to know him. 

I can't tell you what to do, but this is how I got out of my apartment and made some friends. I hope it helps.",,,9,0,0,

The disabled seating has always been great. It has been easy to get to and leave from. Great view and super helpful staff. Sometimes the disabled seating has been the super VIP seating and the super VIP parking which doesn't mean what most people think of when they think 
VIP it just means less security. Less/no crowds and more attentive staff. This however is not the norm.

Disabled parking is hit or miss. Sometimes it is so close to the venue the outside of your car is checked for bombs with mirrors and dogs. Sometimes it's got it's own entrance to the venue. Sometimes it's further than you'd like. Sometimes it's fucking full and you'll want to cry or rage at someone.

If you're sensitive to lights bring sunglasses, I've had situations where the lights are poorly placed and blasting my eyes for whatever reason.

Also, check with your venue on what you are allowed to bring. Some venues won't allow the water. Some venues will allow  specific beverages like a juice box  for medical needs.

I read you comment and started thinking about a kind of back-brace, which could elevate users if required. So if you imagine something wrapped, comfortably, behind the back of your legs, which could support the back as well. Then it sort of allows the user to stand, while lowering foot rests.

You're 28, which is a strike against you, but the biggest issue is that near-complete lack of documentation. I'm a paralegal, not an attorney, but I used to work SSDI cases at the hearing level; medical records are a HUGE part of the case, as proper documentation of the disabling condition is critical. It is an ugly, ugly catch-22, because the disability prevents you from being able to work and thus having the money to get to a doctor, and without the doctor and diagnosis, it's going to be very, very difficult to get approved. Are you saying that you've only ever worked 1 year of your life? If so, you wouldn't qualify for SSDI, as you haven't paid enough into the program from your taxable earnings. You might be able to get SSI, though. I would suggest looking into getting on Medicaid, so that you could see a doctor to get the ball rolling on proper diagnosis and treatment. That might be a good first step towards feeling better. ",,,8,0,0,

Their insight could be persuasive for your parents and helpful to get you started right on mobility aids (using cane or crutches wrong can cause you more pain &amp; fatigue). I think seeing your doctor with parents and raising the question with all present would be a good way to go - address how long it’s been going on, how it affects you (ie you’re isolated, more dependent, pain/fatigue etc) and throw in some points about how it affects your school or job prospects too, that will get their attention... then raise the issue: “I think it’s time to consider mobility aids to help me get to school, keep up with friends.”
You might help by researching where you can get those mobility aids. Canes aren’t costly but forearm crutches can be. Here in Canada the Canadian Red Cross loans out equipment for up to 2 years at low or no cost. Having it be a trial or temporary situation with little cost might help open up your parents minds, with the goal of you being able to manage better at school and in the community.

Something that has really helped me over time is positive affirmations. It may sound silly, this is how I approached it when I first got started. Whenever I would feel self conscious and anxious I'd work on accepting that I'm feeling that way and telling myself something along the lines of I am beautiful, sexy, strong Etc. 

At first I was laughing at myself almost in disbelief, but now I have a lot of fun with it and it's really boosted my confidence and sense of humor (I don't take having a condition so seriously) and it seems that having a light hearted playful view of myself realllly helps me feel sexy. 

I recommend looking up affirmation videos and doing some research and keep a little journal or notepad of some of your favorite affirmations or those that really speak to you/resonate with you.

I hope this helps. :)",,,4,0,0,

By your own admission you have improved. The question is always whether the improvement is significant enough to allow for work activity. That is a question that none of us [the internet] can answer. I know it is an overwhelming situation, and you should talk to your therapist about it.

You always have the right to appeal the decision. You can elect to continue to receive your benefits during the process. They make you sign something saying you'll pay it back, but often times you can make ridiculously low monthly payments. 

If you do appeal, a completely different set of people will look at your case. I guarantee that first examiner didn't have a 'hard-on' for ceasing you, to be honest we don't invest that much emotion into individual cases.

They are independent contractors - self-employed individuals operating their own businesses, and the payments from Uber are reported on 1099 forms are essentially the ""sales"" number for your *business*. All of your *business* expenses, including fuel and depreciation of your vehicle, are deducted from your sales, and the final resulting amount is what then gets carried over from Schedule C to your personal 1040.

It’s okay to have a wheelchair and not use it often. It’s okay to have a wheelchair and use it all the time. Don’t feel embarrassed or like you’re giving up if you choose to get a wheelchair. 

I waited probably 3-6 months too long to accept that a wheelchair may help me. I tried literally everything before getting my chair... cane, walker, forearm crutches... and all left me with pain, still. So, after a neurology visit, (where my neurologist told me that if I keep walking everywhere, I may not be able to walk when I’m older) I tried out one of the store wheelchairs. It was the first time I left a shopping trip without being a grumpy asshole due to the ever rising pain in my body. Then, a month and a half later, I got my own fitted wheelchair. It has opened up so many doors for me. I still have pain, but I have that built in safety net now... I’m never without a seat. Long lines? No problem. Far walks? Sure, let’s go. No seat in a busy place? Yeah, I’ve got my own.

Hey, you're doing great, too :) I'm a plain-spoken person, always have been. I like the way you're really interacting with us, I appreciate it a lot. Most people don't bother, or act a little awkwardly, but you seem really kind.

&gt; I would be so grateful if you could elaborate on this ""mechanical"" mode you have mentioned. I think I know what you mean about the scroll wheel.

I think I described it wrong, sorry. What I meant was, the power switch did 'double duty' as a mode switch. This is close to the one I had, just newer: [Q-Logic](https://www.quantumrehab.com/quantum-electronics/q-logic-3-advanced-drive-control-system.asp). You can see the power switch on the outside left and the speed control on the right. To turn it on, you'd flick the switch up once, then to switch modes you'd flick the switch up again. (I should mention, ""modes"" could mean two things: drive profiles which control how fast the chair goes and how it maneuvers, or tilt/recline/elevate control. But it doesn't matter much which is which, though, I think. I would personally choose to have it go to the latter, tilt mode, but everyone is different.) IMO, in addition to the, um, 'manual inputs,' it's an *overall* better design, but not perfect. The older one was smaller and narrowed, which was really nice, and the newer designs seems to stick with the fewer buttons which is also nice! But the power switch is poorly located, as it's possible to accidentally turn it off or switch modes, which is *really bad design.* I never had a bad accident, just super minor ones at low speeds, but I was conscious of the possibility. It's more likely to happen with that switch than it is with an on/off button.

&gt; ​Please let me know what you think about the idea of blended control and if it would be of any help?

It's really interesting! It sounds like it could help people, but to me I can see a lot going wrong. xD I'm sorry, I don't mean to be a downer -- I really do think there's a population who could use that feature, and the overall idea is kind of nice. For people weaker than me, or those with bad tremors, I could see them using the optional autonomous feature, too. (I wouldn't, because I'm a little obsessive about having control over everything, but that doesn't mean I think it's bad.) 

But the first thing I'm thinking of, about narrow spaces, is a computer might misinterpret a lot of passages as ""narrow."" A doorway comes to mind, because the computer can't predict what's on the other side. Or moving through a restaurant would be another situation. Generally, most places are either too briefly narrow to bother slowing down your whole driving with, or too constant that the user would - if they're the type - use a different driver profile, instead. Or maneuvering through a crowd, that can take a lot of skill for the user and be interpreted as narrow, but not require slow speeds (the opposite, sometimes, is needed!); or worse, the width of the area could vary so much so quickly (ie, a crowd parting in two) that the speed could shift into fast without the user realizing, creating a whiplash effect.

But, I'm sure you'll do the proper testing :) One thing to be mindful of: when programmers make a chair ""slow,"" it is almost always set **way** too slow for everyday / practical use. Apparently, we're expected to cruise along at 1.5mph max, if not slower especially while turning, while the normal walking speed is at least 3mph. It's hard moving at speeds so low! It's unnatural and impractical and just messes with your whole concept of self-placement (where you are in the environment). 

One thing that came to mind... A problem I have pretty consistently is rubbing my tires against doorjambs, because sometimes it's hard to calculate the turn and there's not a lot of room / I'm trying to avoid hitting something else. A lower speed wouldn't help with that, and I would be uncomfortable with handing control over to a computer... But there might be an idea for you there? I might consider using a program to control it for very brief stints, if it was proven, I guess.

&gt; I really like what you said about the trip odometer and battery relationship. 

I love that you like that :D I'm always told things like ""it's hard to evaluate how long is left, because the hydraulics draw power, too,"" but that seems like such an excuse. Sure, they do draw power, but why can't that be factored in when the estimate is based on how much power is left, not how much is being used? 

Practically speaking, I don't think there'll be much use in showing power consumption. From an engineering or software developer standpoint, I could understand, but I'm thinking as a daily user. But, if you thought about it like a cell phone battery: they show percentage left and, in many models at least, estimate how many hours are available. If you could show information like that, it would be *amazing.* Otherwise, you're basically telling the user to do math in their head for how many times they can cross a room (no offense; it's kinda funny to imagine their face if you did xD).

&gt; Out of interest, if you could have any sound, what would it be? I would probably change it depending on my mood. One set jingle though? Constantly? That would drive me a bit mad.

I was slightly hyperbolic... The one I have doesn't have a jingle, it just beeps twice (and lights up every light possible) when first turned on. Anything more than a beep or three and I would be so pissed off. I don't even have the Windows start-up sound enabled, so you can imagine how displeased I was with this, something I turn on over ten times a day (I'm in my chair most of the day) and have to hear the same beep noise over and over. 

I'm more than happy to answer questions, by the way :) One thing you might not realize, but everything ""for disabled people"" is expensive, so some of your ideas in your other comments aren't feasible for market. The exoskeleton would be impractical and too expensive, for example. There's at least one wheelchair series that has the ability to tilt forward, [by Permobil](https://permobilus.com/product/activereach/), but I recently read from people who have it say it barely helps, if they can even use it like they envisioned. It would stress my muscles and be crazy uncomfortable for me. Elevation and mindful seat + footrest + front wheel design covers most situations, I think.

Oh and... I once complained to an architect or engineer (or something) on reddit once about heavy doors, and he brushed me off with ""fire safety."" It felt really dumb because 1) the doors in question had those metal hinges at the top, which helps the strength needed, and 2) I do believe more doors should be autonomous or button-activated by now. Money and laziness controls a lot in the world, though.

Can we all stop fucking doing this please?

If a person has a placard or a plate we need to stop fucking judging what people look like or how we perceive them to be.

I have had a permanent disability from birth. You know how many times my mom has been hassled because she jumped out of the car and ran around and got my sister out and then last my wheelchair and me?

As I got older I was able to finally gain some ability to walk, I used aids less and less until I walking unaided. Thing is, then I was young and masterful at not letting on how fucking awful it is to be out with my friends doing whatever because who wants to be that person?

Now, I'm nearing 40. Unfortunately, I still look 12 and now I can't walk outside my home without a cane or rollator. Thing is, I cannot shop with a cane or rollator. So, I'll be walking in with my shopping cart. And thanks to many years of PT I have an awesome gait when walking with an aid. Strangers are unlikely to see how horrible the walking is on me. The worst won't be until the next day, anyway.

So, thanks for probably judging me or people like me, I wish you wouldn't. There is a good chance you would never see my true need for my placard but I qualify for it without question. As do many people with even less visible disabilities than me.",,,10,0,0,

&gt;I am conducting a study to try and create a more practical control system for powered wheelchair users.

Sincere question, no snark: what do you think is more practical of a control system? There's plenty of things that can be improved in wheelchair design, but I'm not sure *input* is one of them, exactly.

That said: While the joystick itself is fine (imo), the design of the joystick controller as a whole has begun to suck. The recent [R-Net ones](https://www.cw-industrialgroup.com/Products/Mobility-Vehicle-Solutions/R-net), for example, are needlessly long and have a lot of buttons that literally do nothing, or are redundant. The buttons could be simplified, removed, or smaller. One thing my last chair had, was a ""mechanical"" on/off and mode switch and a speed control ""scroll wheel"" (sorry, I'm blanking on the proper term). 

I love having a screen, so that would be key for me, but they're hard to maneuver with in some spots because of the length and it being angled upwards. Features I like having shown on the screen: speedometer in mph, time, total distance traveled, battery charge, speed setting, tilt/recline/elevate controls. These don't have to be pretty. I would love it if there was a calendar or date option, and if I could measure distances with more detail (my old chair had a ""trip odometer,"" which was useful), and maybe even the ability to estimate how far I could go with the remaining charge if I were out on a busy day. And it would be nice to be able to turn it off if I were in a dark area, if I wanted to - preferably something easier than going into the settings, because that can interrupt activity, but understandable if that's unavoidable. (Do not make this ""all, auto, or nothing, no in-betweens,"" please. I like being able to toggle everything at will, not rely on sensors or ""machine learning."")

Oh, and another thing more on the software side... I hate this trend of ""make a noise when you turn something on."" No one else's feet sing a song to declare they're moving. Why does my joystick have to? At least have the *option* to turn it off... (Best I could do was shove cut-up earplugs into the speaker, and it's still annoying.)",,,2,0,0,

But with that disclaimer out of the way, and in the spirit of giving you some direction for your own research:

I would be very cautious about assuming that your treatment of one employee has nothing to do with the treatment of another. Think about it from the plaintiff lawyer's perspective: they are hired to spin arguments about everything you do, and a very common style of argument is, ""Mrs. X claims that she treats Employee Y like she would any other employee, but actually on 10 other occasions these rules were only loosely applied to people ABC, none of whom are disabled like Employee Y."" You can never show the judge and jury what's truly in your mind, and so tons of circumstantial evidence can come into the picture, and that can either help you or hurt you. If there is a pattern of applying the rules differently from person to person, and in a way where a larger burden seems to fall on a protected class (women, racial minorities, disabled people, etc.), you can bet that a good lawyer will ferret that out. How, you might wonder? Well, in lawsuits, there is something called ""discovery,"" and it can be used to force one party to disclose information that is arguably related to the case. It is routinely and inescapably used to get information about much, much more than the treatment of the particular employee at issue.

Incidentally, the above is why lawyers generally recommend having a clear set of procedures and never straying from following it. If you are granting exceptions (except as required by ADA, etc.) routinely, you run the risk of opening up a query into why you were not enforcing the policy evenly. And it undermines your claim that the policy was absolutely critical to the running of the hospital, and therefore enforcement had nothing to do with being unreasonably oversensitive to a disabled person's mentions of her own medical problems when working in a medical setting and unable to avoid discussing medical topics in general.

The reason I said we don't know enough is that we don't know if this particular hospital really had rules like the ones you are describing (no talking to physicians, ever). Unfortunately, I can't reread the original, deleted post, but I recall her saying that displays of general curiosity about other medical topics were not punished. That's the crux of my argument here, that the ""no personal talk"" policy puts \*more\* of a burden on her, as a disabled person, when patients with similar medical issues happen to cross her desk. Calling it personal talk, when irrelevant medical chatter would not have been punished, could be problematic.

And I totally feel you on the difficulties involved in having ASD in your job. But I think the most common sense way to avoid legal battles is to show compassion and sensitivity, even if you feel a little bewildered, because it's just psychologically tougher to sue someone you like. If you're confused, you could always use questions and I statements (even if it feels a little elementary school), for instance, ""Here's how I am seeing the situation and the action I am thinking of taking, for these reasons. Am I missing a piece of the puzzle?"" Then you don't have to guess, you just need to listen.

I find these types of benefit posts overwhelming. They are far too specific for the most broad disability subreddit.

When I first visited this sub I wasn't even sure I was in the right place. I wonder how many other redditors simply miss out because they don't comeback after a poor first impression?

A stickied mega thread or specific flair/tag would be something I would like.

If this is not acceptable than users with complaints should find or create a more relevant subreddit for their needs. It is a literal part of the reddiquette. ***Post to the most appropriate community possible.***

We should have links to more appropriate communities. I don't know anything about disability benefits, I cannot help those people with that but if we had links I could help people by directing them to the proper communities with the specific resources they need.

I don't want to push people away, I think this should be an inclusive place for everyone. I'm just not sure it should be the best place for every topic.",,,3,0,0,

I also didn’t like my scars until some partners told me they were sexy sometimes extra attention payed to them while uncomfortable can be nice! 

What are things that make you feel sexy? Maybe a certain outfit, a song, perfume, being talked to or touched a certain way. Blindfolds can be an incredible way to focus on sensations of touch or someone’s voice. 

This might be TMI but sometimes I find different types of kinky play help me to feel more confident, let’s say I’m shy about my legs, but if they’re tied up then I can’t do anything with them any way. The bondage becomes sexy and because I can’t use my legs, suddenly I’m not as focused on them and feel less awkward. 

It might be helpful to make a list of things that you feel sexy about or arouse you and also mention if there is anything that your partner does that distracts you or makes you feel embarrassed. You could end the list with things you might be interested in trying. 

Sometimes lists are a good way to get across what you want to say when speaking it out loud feels too difficult! ",,,2,0,0,

Not being able to drive or work were huge adjustments that took several years to adjust to on both practical and emotional levels. But in time, I've come through it and can honestly say I'm happier now than I was before I was diagnosed.

When I was diagnosed, I was living in a fairly sizable city with surprisingly limited public transit. I'd never enjoyed living in that area, but my career necessitated it. So when it became obvious that I wasn't going back to work, I tried to find the silver lining: I could move! And since driving was damn near a necessity in that region, it was probably best for me if I did. It took me a year, but I saved up the money to make an interstate move to an area with great mass-transit and never looked back. A car in my new hometown would be helpful, but between mass-transit and ride-share apps, I've been able to get everywhere I need to be.

Not working was a harder adjustment. I had always been a career-oriented person and put a lot of value on my professional life. From time to time, I still struggle with this, but one thing that's helped me is volunteer work. I serve as a docent in a world-class museum two mornings each week as I'm able. This ""job"" provides me with a sense of purpose, regular colleagues, a consistent reason to get out of the house, and an easy answer to the ever-problematic question: so what do you do? I still hate this question because while I'm comfortable with the truth (""I actually have a chronic health problem that prevents me from working full time, but I volunteer regularly at XYZ Museum""), people often respond to that truth with invasive questions like ""what health problem?"" or ""how do you pay rent?"" and I don't feel I owe anyone my personal health and financial information. 

In any event, I've forged a good life for myself post-disability. I have good friends whom I see often, I'm financially stable despite ""earning"" less than half of what I did while working, I have an incredibly supportive partner whom I love to pieces, and a ""job"" that I like. It took me a lot of time to get here, and I would still return to work immediately if I could, but if I'm being honest...it'd be an adjustment for me to go back to full time work now that I've finally created a life without it.",,,5,0,0,

When we feel shitty about the physical limitations we face, then try and push those feelings down because we know we should not feel sorry for ourselves (or should magically feel better just because someone somewhere has it worse), then we are denying what is actually true for us. We are making it worse because we are not acknowledging the grief that is a natural response to our situation. That in fact denying that grief is just another form of toxic positivity we are subjecting ourselves to.

When she said that, I just felt the heartbreaking truth of that grief and sadness wash over me. I was crying (and I never cry). I wanted to swim so badly, to be able to hike to lovely places, to dance with friends, and to just walk without worrying if I can make it back to the car. That longing for basic, pleasurable things that almost everyone takes for granted, except for us. 

So did I want to feel that grief and sadness? Hell no. But after that, it just eased something in me, and made it easier somehow. I still feel the longing to do these things and I still feel sad or frustrated when I can't. But it's so much less now, and it passes quickly. All because someone helped me recognize the depth of that grief I had been building up for years by denying it even existed.

I was raised by a mother who only accepted the expressing of the ""good"" emotions, so I learned to push everything down, to always smile, and act happy no matter what. Same with my disability issues. When someone finally explained the term ""toxic positivity"" to me I was kind of gobsmacked. It set me up to deny all my unpleasant emotions, causing many of them to fester and emerge in shitty ways (including more physical ailments). I think many girls are socialized this way, to varying degrees.

It took decades, but I now get that I am allowed to feel shitty about something that truly IS shitty: Like being the only one in the group who can't go on a hike to see something wondrous like a waterfall. That SUCKS. Period. Pretending otherwise is just unfair to me AND to that glorious waterfall surrounded by ferns and rainbows. ��

One other tool I use when I am dealing with that outdoors longing: I go on YouTube and search for ""POV hiking"" or ""drone Hawaii coastline"" or ""POV scuba diving."" Finding the good ones and watching them on my big TV (the higher res, the better), especially with headphones, can help me feel part of the bigger world out there. 

Sorry if this is all TMI, but maybe it helps a little with your situation.",,,4,0,0,

I know it's hard to say because everyone differs and most don't want to hear this, but I was thought the trick that you should explain how your disability has helped you learn to do thinks or find creative work arounds that others normally wouldn't think of. (Ie if you have ADHD then you can say it thought you how to be more organized so you don't lose focus and better keep track of dates. For me i explain to them all the ways I have found Tourette has help me improve in myself and what ways I use it to my advantage)

If you don't want to use this trick there is always the option of just not saying anything, I've seen people never speak of their disability. They just let it be, if a person ask then you can feel free to explain to them about it. Otherwise just tell them why you should be valued and don't make too oh of a deal out of your disability. (This isn't saying that you shouldn't ask for accommodations or anything like that, just don't make it seem like your disability is a liability)

(He knows I'm disabled, he's kind. *I am kind.*) He offered to do light bulbs and he'd grab the trash (I don't make much).

Apartment living also keeps things accessible. Laundry is right down the hall and the whole place is small.

If you want to own a home buy something 1,000 sq. ft. or smaller. You'll have to hire help for maintenance.

Auto pay for bills. Multi day, cell phone alarm for appointments. Write stuff where you'll see it.

Example, hair appointment - as soon as you make the appointment set an alarm for the morning of the appointment and one for right before allowing for time needed to get there. Set a timer to wash your hair the night before if you don't wash it daily or don't pay to have it washed there. Set an alarm to get cash for the tip. Or wrap a note around your debit card.

When I am in a bad way laundry doesn't get folded or put away. Cleaning is wiping counters with wipes, Swiffering the floor, automatic toilet cleaner. A dishwasher or pulling a chair up to the sink (I keep some paper and plastic ware but it's expensive and it makes trash.) 

Meals are simple: instant oatmeal, PB&amp;J, ""grilled"" cheese (pop bread in toaster, butter, pop in microwave to melt cheese), hummus and veggies with pita, a lot of baked potatoes with chili or broccoli cheese or bacon and cheese or tuna and cheese. Smoothies. Eggs. Greek yogurt.

When I really want a meal I cook for four people and eat three portions over the next 3 days, freezing the fourth for later. I make a lot of casseroles and one pot stuff.

Doing one or two things a day. Nothing should take long or be strenuous. The thing is, you have to do the 20 minutes. If you skip it you're fucking yourself over. Make a list post it and check stuff off if you have to. 

* Monday: take shower
* Tuesday: grocery shop (Aldi mostly, other stores 1× per mo.), clean fridge (order takeout, cook something from freezer)
* Wednesday: take shower and change sheets
* Thursday: laundry
* Friday: take shower, change litter ×1 per mo. (I scoop daily)
* Satuday: clean raised surfaces, dust
* Sunday: clean floors and soft surfaces

I clean the kitchen and bathroom as I use it. Every morning wipe toilet and sink area with wipes, use daily shower spray.
Wipe down kitchen with wipes, wash the very few dishes I make or put them in dishwasher.

Try to hire someone to come in and give it a deep clean every 3 months if you feel you can't manage. Look for super discounts for first time customers. Use 4 companies per year if you need.

Here are my top 5. They're more general. I didn't really focus on rides because they're so varied and disabilities are so varied.  I guess I would like more supportive seating on all rides and more restrictive harnesses. It's the main reason I don't ride many rides anymore. Even the gentle stuff is too much for my weakass trunk/core.

Also, I have trouble with crowds but I blame humans not the park - they're pushy jerks.

***#1 - Lack of accessible bathrooms***

So, I am sure any person (in the US, at least) that needs an accessible toilet will tell you they are woefully inadequate. 

Firstly, it is rare that they're actually solely for disabled people. So often there are baby diaper changers in them or infant seats. Adults with children often use them for their size to corral their kids that need supervision while everyone uses the toilet.

Even when there are 15 standard toilets and ONE accessible toilet everyone uses the damn accessible toilet. People would look at me with a cane and say, ""Go ahead that one up there is open,"" as they exit a standard toilet and then I am stuck announcing I'll wait for the accessible one (since I can't go from sitting to standing without a grab bar or easily do my pants without more assistance than my cane--though I don't usually have to use so much detail).

Never mind when I use a rollator. I am not leaving it outside for someone to screw with it. 

So, I might wait for 6 people behind me to go in any of the numerous stalls while I wait for the one I can use. So, not only does it simply take longer for my bathroom break because I am just slower at all things, I have a longer wait.

Not gonna lie, it would be really nice if accessible toilets were just for disabled people.

Also, it would be nice if the toilets were truly accessible for all. Like what they have going on in the UK. There needs to be larger stalls than we currently have, they need to have a place to change people that aren't babies and they need to be gender neutral. More than once I have come across little old ladies with their male caregiver sitting outside trying to figure out how things are going to happen. Of course, I know this happens with all genders and ages I've just personally experienced it this way. 

***#2 - Assistance is needed with self-serve food and drinks.***

I hate that I cannot get my own food and drinks to my table all the time. Or that I have to fumble with lids and straws* and napkins. It's a crappy situation. There are hacks for another time and place that I have but I hate having to always think about that stuff.

***#3 - The current issues with straws***

I get that disposable plastic straws are really terrible but let them be something provided when asked for or at the very least don't shame and lecture me for asking if they are available. Or figure out something else you can offer someone with disability.

***#4 - High seating in bars and restaurants***

It's impossible for me to sit in these trendy counter and bar height places. We've had to leave places that don't offer enough of anything else and figure something else out.

***#5 - Gravel or similarly loose natural material paths***

It is all but impossible for me to walk on these kinds of surfaces. It's miserable.

Do you not WANT to work, or are you UNABLE to work? Those are very different. To have any idea on how to advise you, some basics should be known: What are you limitations? What exactly is your disability? Is your anxiety diagnosed? Is your disability established by a doctor to be to the point that it impedes your functioning?   


Whether or not you have a diagnosis and the backing of a doctor can really dictate which path is best to take with parents.  
If you quit your job, will you be able to find a different one that is more in line with your abilities? If not, keep in mind that it takes 3-5 years to get approved for Social Security Disability, and you cannot earn any income during that time. When you get on Disability, assuming you are young and don't have much of a work history established at this point and don't have decades of paying into Social Security, you will only get around $800 a month to live on, and will be in danger of losing it if you make any money on the side. It's a really rough life.   


If you have medical coverage through your job, your best bet is to hang on for as long as you can, and see as many doctors as you can and get as much of a medical history established as possible. That way, you will have a better chance of getting your Disability approved before a judge, and a better chance of keeping the respect and trust of your parents. ",,,1,0,0,

b6dd7feb-ffc3-471c-a539-ec1bcdc9d39d,1549161601," As a kid, I saw lots of adults ignoring kids who were different in any way. This always upset me.
 
 I grew up alongside about ten kids who came and went from the same schools, but in a classroom way at the end of the school.

 These kids were brought in front of the auditorium when I was in fourth grade. The special education teachers told us that we could take one girl, Myraiah, for a walk at recess if we wanted to. Something struck me about the way they said that. 

 At recess, some kids would shove each other toward Myraiah and shout, ""He's wants to walk with her!"" Embarrassing kids that were already unsure about the way she looked. 
 
I asked one of the teachers if I could take Myraiah to play with me instead of just being walked in a circle around the basketball court. 
 Her teacher showed me how to spell in her hand, as she could not hear and how to help her to feel my face, as she could not see. 

 I took Myraiah out to the baseball field to pick flowers, I described the birds pecking at the grass. Sometimes we sat in the baseball dugout, sometimes we felt the bark on the trees around the school. I even brought stuffed animals to show and share with her. 

 I moved around a few different cities and when I came back to the same town in high school, Myraiah had learned to get around the school with a white cane. I was so excited for her. 

 I was disappointed, however, to hear many of the same kids still making fun of her. I got in a couple of fights with boys over it.  
 It's painful to hear sadistic people talk about others as though they aren't the same. As if they are to be pitied or shunned for things they have no control over. That they don't have the same right to be here as them. 

 How can we encourage people to get in touch with empathy instead of sympathy, to reach out and to lead their kids over to say hello? 

 I wonder about Myraiah all the time. She was a just a couple of years older than me. Nobody seems to remember her, and I don't see how that's possible. She was right there with us at recess, in the cafeteria, in assemblies, even on field trips. 

 I've shared some stories about my friend Myraiah with my own two children. I want them to feel secure about approaching disabled people just like able-bodied people, talking about the same things they like and are interested in. I want them to know that each individual person's thoughts, opinions and experiences are valid and important and not to exclude anyone because of their experience or the way they cope. 

Looking back on my childhood at this moment, I think Myraiah was the best friend I ever had. She never judged me or scorned me or acted out of spite. She genuinely enjoyed spending time just being kids and playing in the grass. She was there for me. 

Anyway, thanks for sharing this experience. Do the kids you work with talk about adults keeping their kids away? Do they approach kids to play?

792f3385-0f6b-44ce-8fd1-0266ded346ee,1550489602,"I've been bedridden for 5ish years, with some in and out in the last bit. Here's some things that helped me: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Laptop and internet. When I suddenly became disabled right out of college I lost basically all of my friends. People tend to lose touch during those kinds of transitional periods, and honestly I was the friend who was always driving people places so they weren't in the habit of visiting me. Internet access helped keep me connected in some way to other people. For me, it's not the same because I have a very difficult time bonding with others in an online setting, but it was definitely better than staring at a wall.   

2. Get a wheelchair. I recommend an electric wheelchair, because you will be too tired to push around in a manual chair. If transporting a big, two ton chair is something you don't think you can do, try a folding wheelchair with a removeable motor, like the Smart Drive. (They're also waterproof which can be a big boon.) Honestly, having a wheelchair so I could leave the house without being carried was HUGE for me. That and moving to a new home that was wheelchair accessible and on the bus line. I still don't go out super often, because I am still tired a lot, but it has made a big difference in my agency. (People will say ""oh no, wheelchair so tragic"" but fuck them. Wheelchairs are a goddamned blessing. Being unable to get out of bed sucks, and wheelchairs are the magic that lets you move around.)  

3. Acceptance. For me, a really huge thing was accepting that the condition I have (EDS/POTS) is lifelong. It cannot ever be cured, only managed. There is so much going on in lack of control of your life, and as I am mildly a control freak, that was REALLY hard for me to adjust to. We are taught a lot of negative things about being disabled, but in truth humans are extremely adaptable. Much more than we realize. We can enjoy life even with extreme restrictions on us. We can adapt! This too, shall become normal. And that's actually a good thing. When you accept that your body may just suddenly quit on you, you can make better decisions on how you spend the energy you have on good days. You can enjoy life with what you have, and know that it may not last. But that's okay. This too shall pass. Roll with the blows. Making friends with other disabled people, disabled people with conditions all over the spectrum, can help you see that being bedridden is just another way of life. It's normal, and a lot of people live normal, happy lives while mostly being in bed. And that's okay.   

4. Don't overdo your good days. Many conditions have good and bad days. If this is true for you, you'll be able to do more some days than others, and it can be tempting to get everything crammed in that you can. For folks who are generally healthy but have been bedridden due to a temporary illness, pushing through can help them get rid of deconditioning. If, like me, your illness affects bodily functions necessary to sustain life, then pushing yourself on good days will actually damage your organs and make you sicker over time. And man, did I push lol. Instead, do \*\*less\*\* than you are physically able to do on good days. Leave yourself a lot of comfort cushion. The goal is to try to do just a little bit every day, whether good or bad, and hold on to that. Don't ever start doing more until you can go two weeks in your routine without any problems. This will protect you from huge backlashes and help you stabilize your baseline health. (This was a really hard lesson to learn!)  

5. Hobbies, hobbies, hobbies. Seriously, connect with things you love that you can do while sick. It is so easy to lose sight of yourself and the things you love when you are perpetually in a crisis. Read. (With brain fog, I can't read well anymore and I've always had a hard time understanding audio, so I do both at once and that seems to work for me.) Draw. (Get a drawing tablet, Bamboo Create is a good start, or get a scanner for traditional arts.) Write. (If you like to write, you can do it on your own or start working on a project with others online.) Learn to program. (I develop a type of video game called a visual novel!) Knit. (I can't get ahold of the tension, but I use a mechanical knitting machine-- [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071YSTN8Z) is the best one for the price and it saves a lot of fatigue as well.) Try needle felting. (You can make [cute 3D animals](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EE19UQG/) with wool while working out your anger/frustration by stabbing things with needles.) Learn to mold clay sculptures. (I eventually want to make to-scale Pokemon figures.) Watch movies/shows. (I watch a lot of anime on crunchyroll or from nyaa torrents.) Try tabletop gaming! (Like Dungeons and Dragons type stuff, but there's lots of different genres. Ryuutama is a really nice, relaxing one! Exalted is about being a demi-god badass. Blue Rose or Queen's Cavaliers are both really neat and diverse worlds. There's something for everyone, plus can get a lot of social activity in without much physical requirements.)",,,8,0,0,

To be up front, I myself am not living with a disability so I won’t have a full appreciation for your situation, but perhaps I can still contribute to your search for something meaningful.
Let’s talk about working.  If mobility is a concern for you then let’s focus only on online work.  Are you familiar with services like Fiverr.com and Upwork.com?  Essentially you are an independent person offering some service and you set the price but can also make custom negotiation.  You might be surprised by the amount of different things that small businesses need to get done and are willing to go find someone online and pay to do it!  Things like writing, drawing, designing, programming, voice-overs, video production, etc.  
Now, you might think that you have nothing obvious to offer, but spend some time browsing those sites and marvel at the really odd and specific things being offered.  It might inspire you to look at yourself and identify some things you are good at and, for some reasonable fee, offer that.  You might have to be a bit more bold than you usually are to put yourself out there but you should try!
In the event you don’t think you could offer something useful right now, but see something you are interested in doing, then learn it!  There are so many online learning resources (many are free) that will get you up to speed on web design, programming, Photoshop, video editing, etc.  (I, personally, am familiar with the programming and design world so you’ve notice I tend to mention those things but there are other things).  An important part is joining online communities for designers (deviantart.com, behance) and programmers (Github, Stackoverflow) to give and receive support and info.
It will take weeks and months to get a basic level of proficiency, but if you have realistic expectations and discipline you will end up having skills that have real value in the world and you can use to help others.  THIS is what I find gives my life meaning, maybe it’s something that resonates with you?",,,1,0,0,

I appreciate many of the statements that you make in your post, as I have had many similar experiences, as well as those in the responses posted as well.

I'm 39, with CP, and I use a wheelchair. I don't drive, but I do have a paying job in IT supporting 6,400 people.

I haven't been on a date in 17 years.

I met a girl in college who was quite nice and we became friends. We did nice things for each other, helped each other out and spent time together. Eventually, we went out on a dinner date. I'd never been out on a dinner date before, and made all the plans and we both had a wonderful time. We agreed that we would go on a picnic in the future.

Time passed, and eventually I was introduced to another male friend of hers. When I called to finalize plans for the picnic, she indicated that this may was her boyfriend, and that ""he didn't have any problems, so he could help her with her problems""

Needless to say, I didn't speak to her again.

Fast forward fifteen years, and this same girl e-mails me wanting to ""catch up"". By now, she is married and has three small children. Eventually we meet up at my house after several failed attempts. The conversation was pleasant. As we were finishing up our time together, I call to her attention that I had not forgotten what was said fifteen years prior. She did remind me that I had told her that I loved her (which I had) and I reminded her of her reply. I told her calmly what she had told me at that time, and that it was the most hurtful thing that any person had ever said to me. She made three attempts to apologize and save what she felt was a viable friendship, but I let her know she needed to pick up her children from childcare.

I'm not turned off from dating because of this, but I do have a very basic standard. If you can't treat me with dignity and respect, I don't want to spend time with you.

It’s easy for me to look at a starving person and say “I remember two months ago i went a full week without eating, i just changed my mindset on day 4 and then on day 8 my friend gave me a sandwich. It wasn’t that bad!” The other person is still starving, still in pain, all you’ve done is remind them that somehow they aren’t good enough to leave the struggle they’re in. 
And fundamentally? Changing my mindset won’t do a goddamn thing. I can say i don’t get dates cuz I’m disabled, or because I’m ugly, or because I’m stupid. I could convince myself i don’t get dates because there’s a glitch in the tinder system that doesn’t show anyone my profile. All of those things are changes in mindset. None of them result in making dating easier. 
Same thing with my outlook. I’ve also spent time believing i wouldn’t have a hard time dating. Were the results any different than they are now that I’ve given up? Nope! Nobody can read my mind. Nobody can look at me and say “Oh he’s not expecting a date that means I’m not gonna do it.” It just... doesn’t make sense. Positive Thinking is a scam used to sell self help books. It’s certainly more healthy to think positively but it doesn’t just manifest itself into real world changes, that’s not how things work.

Note that an accommodation can be denied if it interferes with the functioning of the workplace. For example, if you ask for longer time to complete tasks that wouldn't work at a job that requires a specific completion time for tasks.

Closed captions (what you need) are far superior to open subtitles (what you have) because they are much more detailed. Not only do they put the dialogue into words they make note of ALL of the audio in the video.

Additionally, when closed captions are closed they trigger my computer system preferences to automatically show them to me (very clearly, independent of my quality settings) in a very specific manner that is easiest for me to see with my vision problems.

As you yourself said, your son is deaf and is directly impacts him. I promise you these things are important and while you think you understand and have this covered, you don't.

It's a mix of what you can afford and how much you feel it would benefit you, the same as buying any other product.

Scrub the idea of ""part-time user"" from your mind. Think of each mobility product in terms of how much it will help you, how usable it is for you, and then balance that against the cost *in your own eyes*. If what a product brings to you is worth the cost, it doesn't matter that you're a part-time user. If it isn't worth the cost, then it never mattered that you were a part-time user either.

VR studies and work in neuroremapping has allowed paralyzed patients to [walk again](https://www.neuro.duke.edu/research/research-news/how-vr-helping-paraplegics-walk-again), albeit using a exoskeleton. These studies also had patients recover control over internal muscles such as bladder and bowel function, significantly improving their quality of life.

I guess it depends on your definition, but people are learning to walk again. They’re using their brains to control an exoskeleton, and that process has been shown to help them regain control over their legs on their own. But it’s relatively new research for sure, and this was all done with people who had been paralyzed for a while. They suspect that “new” paralysis patients would be able to recover much quicker and more completely. 

*Five years ago* the same VR technology was used to make the ceremonial [first-kick](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-27812218) of the World Cup in Brazil, though it was in its infancy and a kick was about all the gentleman could manage with it. Today, using a different type of technology (not brain waves), ReWalk has people standing up out of their wheelchairs, [walking and climbing stairs](https://youtube.com/watch?v=tTBoYt8Pz_w) without any aid beyond their exoskeleton and a cane.

Even the estim you mentioned is super promising. Recovering sensation and mobility is the first step. Paired with VR people could potentially see dramatic improvements in relatively short period of time.

That’s the reason I put cured in quotes. Not because we’ve completely reversed damage, but because we have an early-stage *functional* solution to patients being unable to walk. And all of this has been done in the last ~8 years. Moore’s Law is in play, and within the next 50-years we will undoubtedly have paralyzed people walking alone again. Maybe not the worst cases of paralysis, and almost certainly only the richest who can pay for private treatment, but I’d bet my very last dollar on the fact that it will be possible. I suspect it could be as early as 25 years.

It’s a shock to the system, but you could write a story set in 2019 about a paralyzed man learning to walk again and regaining his autonomy through the use of an exoskeleton connected to his brain and it would be considered accurate to the time period. In terms of what is/isn’t sci-fi, a paralyzed man walking with an exoskeleton is no longer science fiction. ",,,2,0,0,

I have an invisible disability too. I got yelled at the other week at the gas station because I was parked by a pump and cleaning my windows with the squeegee but I could only use one hand and it was very painful. It was taking forever but I was so proud of myself for doing it and giving myself this silent pep talk the whole time about how awesome I am for doing a normal person thing despite my disabilities. Anyway the pumps were all full and some asshole got out of his pickup to tell me I'd go a lot faster if I used both hands. 

Like, I knew it was busy there and I was taking up a pump, but that's where the soap bucket was and I couldn't see through my windows anymore and shit was dangerous and I can't be walking across the parking lot to wet my squeegee all night, I had shit to do. So I told him to go fuck himself as cheerfully as possible and he may have caught sight of my disabled parking pass in my windshield, because he went and waited in his truck like a gentleman. I was still proud of myself for cleaning my windows, and I didn't spend any more energy worrying about that dude. I had shit I needed to get done, and I just don't care if I inconvenienced someone in the process if it couldn't be helped. 

You need to swim to feel as well as possible, you don't have time to be worrying if your existence is inconvenient to someone's privilege. I'm sure this won't be your last experience, but hopefully it doesn't bother you so much next time. Just do what you've got to do and try not to be an asshole (which it sounds like you're doing, you're obviously well-intentioned), and if someone else can't do the same they're not worth it. 

I love that you had more faith in people than this, you must have a good family. The internet is the only place I ever see that it's common. Most people know that it's not cool to feel like that and shame keeps them in line in the real world. And most people are honestly just ignorant and have no experience with disability, and I really want to believe that if they did they would feel differently.

My disability is not always visible (I should wear my braces more to be fair) unless you're looking for it (crooked shoulders, hips, ect- I have EDS). And it does make me self concious but when I'm bringing someone's fantasy to life I feel so powerful and in control of a body that I'm usually fighting with. I feel sexy. I feel sexual. I feel amazing and confident and comfortable and beautiful. It has massively improved my mental health as well, by giving me an avenue to contribute to my household and feel like I'm doing more than just sitting around being sad.

My job is definitely not for everyone, and I still kind of struggle with people who solely fetishize my disability, rather than seeing me as a sexual person.

Anyway, all of this to say that there is a way out there. I can't tell you what that might look like for you. Perhaps, since you struggle with photographs being taken of you- you can get a boudoir shoot? Or try art modeling? I understand how frustrating it can be to overcome negative feelings about yourself, and I'm sorry I can't tell you what your right path is, but I don't want you to give up. I believe that one day you will see yourself as a sexy, beautiful, empowered woman who happens to have a disability.

Swimming is a sport though that attracts highly competative people who often train seriously.  Ettiquite is a shared language so workouts can be done efficiently.  It is nothing personal  and has nothing to do with disabledness.  Adults are also often busy and want to get in and out of the pool quickly...again, nothing personal.

The fast swimmer has a right to be there and swim fast.  Maybe his family is there and he doesn’t want to pay for a membership at another pool.  Maybe he works close by and that location saves time.  

I didnt see you mention how you swam with your sister.  Did she also take breaks with you?  Was she standing at the end with you?  If there were four groups in two lanes you could have split with you and your sister using half and the gentleman using the other half.  You neednt get out for a 20 second rest but you also need to keep a clear space so he can turn properly.  Stay to your side and stand as far as possible in the corner.  It is ok to communicate with a new lane partner your needs and what you can offer.  If your sister is taking breaks with you, that can be seen as socializing.  It seems she could be swimming 2 pool lengths while you rest.  There is also the option for you two to swim in different lanes since you are the only one needing to take breaks.

If it continues to be an issue, speak to whoever is in charge.  Pool etiquette is just guidelines and not set in stone rules.  

A pool I used to go to was also 3 lane and when there was a class, the fast lane was suspended.  Perhaps your pool might need to look into suspending some type of swimming or walking during class time if the two remaining lanes can’t accommodate the people wanting to use them.  

Also, never hesitate to go to a guard to have a rule enforced.  If there are kids or parents clearly goofing around in the lap lanes when you want to lap swim, just go to a guard if you dont feel comfortable approaching them yourself or they won’t move over for you.

Hope things work out for you!",,,2,0,0,

It's just that sighted people have less tendency of hiring a blind person (based on the negative connotations or presumptions I cleared up on this thread.) It is also hard to seek employment as a Deaf person. Companies would think that you are ""too dependent"" because you're always relying on something to write down, someone to repeat what they said, (since lip reading does not pick up everything), the apps you mentioned, and a translator, (since most people do not know ASL).  A translator is not free unless you already know someone to translate with, then companies may often worry about how much to pay that translator and therefore, may not hire you, the Deaf client of the translator. It goes both ways in other words. It's hard to read lips and speech to text is wayyy less functional than text to speech. (I tried both apps and text speech is amazing! They actually translate what is being written, whereas you *really* have to find the *right* speech to text app!) I rode public transit a couple of times after losing my sight lately on-campus. I'm glad I had the opportunity to hear where the appropriate stop is before I would miss it. But I usually take paratransit. There's some hangups with that too, so I schedule 15 mins earlier than my appointment time. (I have been late because I didn't, but I still prefer that over the more corrupt ""abled"" transit). I don't like driving. 

I preferred being Deaf just for the sheer curiosity. I couldn't and still couldn't imagine what it is like to travel with hearing loss, though I still appreciated my hearing. That was still a big thing to me! :) I watched how being Deaf was in the eyes of a couple of Deaf people *long after* the curiosity phase (age 5-6), but I can only imagine temporarily.

SSI counts some assistance you receive from others for food and shelter expenses as income, they call it in kind support and maintenance. If a SSI recipient lives in the household of another person and receives both food and housing from the household, or either food or shelter, SSA applies a one third reduction from the federal benefit rate. See [https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0500835200](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0500835200) and [https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0500835300](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0500835300) 

A SSI recipient should generally be considered as living in their own household if they have rental liability (a legally binding rental agreement that they could be evicted for nonpayment) [https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0500835120](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0500835120) and buy and consume food separately or pay for food in a room and board arrangement.

If a SSI recipient is staying with friends or family, they are supposed to consider whether or not they are receiving a discount on rent. To screen for this they may ask the landlord (friend or family member) how much they would charge for rent if they were not related, and count the value of any discount as income to the SSI recipient as in kind support. 

If they cannot get information from the related landlord about the value of the housing in general they can rely on general information from for example real estate companies or rental management agencies. See [https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0500835380](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0500835380).

I started being mostly bedbound a year ago. I was able to go to work a few days a work with much pain even on meds, but since the New Year I can’t even tolerate walking that much. I can barely walk at the home. I usually only get up to go to the bathroom or to eat, but that aggravates my condition. 

I found out that I have two bad discs in my lower back, and one of them has been herniated for maybe 9 years now. Ive been dealing with sciatica and back spasms for that long. Ive been through PT, and it didnt help. My doctors are looking for surgery options now, but they seem reluctant to make a decision.

My employer seems like they have given up on me. Im the main bread winner for my family and Im almost out of leave. I cant spend time with my family doing the things they want to do. My friends will call me, but Im sick of people asking if I feel better... its not like a herniated disc just goes away. Im tired of friends giving me pseudo-science advice when they know absolutely nothing about this. So many friends and family think there is an “easy fix” if I see a certain type of doctor or eat some magic food.

I just started my journey being 99% bedridden a month and a half ago. It is comforting to know others deal with this.

Ive always been into computers so I find being on a computer gives limitless possibilities on what you can learn and do. I just got into video game development recently with Unity. It’s free and there are training videos on Youtube for free as well.

I had eighteen months of protracted withdrawal symptom after tapering off over six months.

Have a continuous dialog with your doctor and your pharmacist about how to do it long term. Ask if muscle relaxers could provide the relief you need. They aren't quite as addictive.

As far as the experience, these medications are supposed to wash over you with a slightly warm feeling that makes you like everything is okay.

Over time, these drugs kind of make people stop caring what others think. Some of them can make people feel angry and aggressive, both while on them and after they wear off.

Using the medications as needed is the way to go but, often, they are prescribed to take regularly on a schedule. I was told not to miss doses because of the risk of seizures. I now use antihistamines for anxiety, as my attacks come at night when I'm too tired.

I didn't find this out until I got the denial letter  and saw they only used a fraction of my medical history to make the  decision.

This is because social security is not going to look at your records back to birth. For physical impairments, disability requests records a year back from your alleged onset (if applying for SSDI) or filing date (if applying for SSI) and three years back for mental impairments. This is for a few reasons. First, all current records include a ""history of present illness""- this will be a summary of your surgeries and other major medical issues that are pertinent to your condition. Second, disability is concerned with how you are functioning NOW, not how you were functioning 5 years ago. Disability wants to know how your impairment affects your ability to work TODAY, not how it affected you after your first surgery when you were 8 (as an example). So while you feel they only used a fraction of your medical records to make the decision, the analyst actually used what policy considers pertinent and relevant.

The longer version is that there are a lot of rules about DWB that are hard to remember. The simple explanation is that the DWB is about the same amount as the age 60 widow(er)’s benefit, but the widow(er) can receive it as early as age 50 if determined to be disabled.

For DWB and widow(er) benefits, the benefit is based on the earnings of the deceased worker. Your mother’s earnings record is not relevant.

TLDR: Your mother should make an appointment to file for DWB with SSA. This is a great opportunity to ask questions and understand the program. ",,,3,0,0,

These rules are super overwhelming!  I will probably just quit selling things on Paypal to do away with that burden, but what worries me big time is the fact that I may not be able to save the leftover money at home after withdrawing it from the bank.  The idea of blowing so much money every month when I'm SUPPOSED to be saving it just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  Of course I can save receipts for any big purchases, but the pressure to get rid of the money every month is going to be downright panic-inducing if they want absolute proof that it was spent rather than saved as cash.  My lawyer failed to mention ANY of this :(

I don't qualify for an ABLE account due to my age &amp; am not saving the money for anything in particular--just for the purpose of one day moving out on my own &amp; having emergency savings like everyone else who's a responsible adult.  I will definitely tell them I'm gonna pay my parents rent/food/utility money every month so they will award me the full amount as instructed by my lawyer.  I'm less worried about that...just getting scared I'll be pressured to blow all the money super fast on things I don't need at this particular time.  

Oh, one more question:  What would count as a ""large cash withdrawal""?  And would removing it from the bank account in smaller amounts at a time cause them to ask fewer questions at the annual review?  Like $80 here; $60 there; $90 there, etc.  ",,,1,0,0,

To me it's obvious that she was fired for allowing her socializing to affect her work and the doctors work as well. Auditing my billers work is very time consuming for me and I only do it due to a providers/patient complaint received or our annual mandatory audits. If I am auditing an employees work Ive already decided to fire you. Auditing their work is simply CYA to prevent them from getting unemployment. Clerical mistakes are a frequent cause of termination. We can be sued and have been sued due to a billers medical documentation. Clerical errors are a very common reason I chose to let my staff go. Accurate documentation is extremely important where I work. If her personal life was affecting her job, why would her disability be relevant? Should I be forced to continue to employ someone who is unable to perform their duties solely on the fact that she has a disability. I work in TX, explanation of termination is not needed. I am very concerned that a lawyer believes OP has a valid case. I've fired people for less. Am I at risk of being sued? May I ask what field of law you practice? 

Cancer is mentioned in regards to my employer. MD Anderson is a hospital for oncology. 

And although she didn't lose her emotional shit at her place of employment, she sure AF did with the email. I found it to be a completely unneccesary long rant about her medical history and areas of interest. It came across as mental instability and extremely irrelevant. As a employer I don't give a shit about your personal life or intrest. You're here to do a job. I pay competitive salaries and I expect to see that in your work. You're not hired to socialize and make friends. You're hired to do a job. I am not your friend. Don't give a shit about what you do in your off time. Unless you use that free time to harrass me after I've let you go with some BS rant. The simplicity of their response shows me they found it as obnoxious as I did.

But if I'm wrong i'm wrong. Would just love an explanation as I completely fail to understand how this in any way shows discrimination. If a employees medical history should be considered before termination I'd like to know how to protect myself. ",,,2,0,0,

Those early days of my injury were rough. It completely halted my life and for a long while I was just trying to survive. I truly believed that if I worked hard, I would completely recover and restart my life. Now I have grasped that-- though I can improve some-- this is chronic. It's taken a good 2 years to get my health stable, and once I get my new assistive devices later this year I hope to progress even more in my life. 

My disability is noticeably physical, so people do stare curiously, but it is what it is ��‍♀️ I can walk, though I need assistive devices. At one time I had to use a walker, and that was awful, as I was obviously young and walking at the pace of an old man. People did stare, but as some of my paraplegic friends have told me, eventually you get used to it. People are just curious. Kids are the only ones who will ask what happened to my legs, and I appreciate their forthcomingness. But there are also perks to apparent physical disability, as people will let me go first, and generally prefer me, which is nice, though not necessary. It is extremely rare that anyone laughs; that's only happened once when I accidentally farted in public (SCI has affected my control), and it was just young teens, so meh ��‍♀️ The average person is not cruel, and most people are too preoccupied with their own lives to notice your foot drop, I promise.

Also, it sounds like you desperately need an upgrade. I wear leg braces as well. Many leg braces are only effective for about 2 years, and then you may need an entirely different brace. If you are in the U.S., get your primary care doc to refer you to a doctor of physical medicine and rehabilitation. He can evaluate your nerve issues and walking needs and then refer you to an orthotist to get fitted for a better leg brace. Once you get your new brace you may need physical therapy as well, which they'll set up with you. Leg braces that work with your body are absolutely, unbelievably life-changing, and if your current brace is making things worse or preventing improvement, it's high time for an upgrade. If you have further questions about the process, feel free to DM me.

Now that my health is more stable I'm trying to move forward. My sudden disability ended my career, which was pretty active in nature. I'm not a diehard career person, but I truly loved my job and I really miss it. (And for the first time in over a decade I'm jobless, and that's just weird ��.) Currently I'm in school for something more paraplegia-friendly. I hope to finish school this year, but it will depend on how the body treats me. (I tend to have problems when sitting up for more than 2 hours.)

Limited public transportation here and I can't have my old car modified. So, once I'm finally employed I'll be saving up for a new car that can be modified. I look forward to gaining that independence back.

I love people and I've always been big into volunteer work, but that had to go on hold for a while. Now I'm getting back into some volunteer activities again... not everything, but some things I can still handle, and it helps a lot, especially mentally. People have to find purpose somewhere, ya know?

This whole experience used to really screw me up mentally... It's like I'm 18 all over again, have nothing, and am trying to figure out things all over again, made even more complicated with my new disability. But now I try to look at it as ""I get a re-do on life!"" Whatever works, right? �� I have my bad days, but I try to choose to be positive. I know I'll always find a way to be happy, and I'm trying to believe I'll be successful again one day too. 

My SO, who was with me before the accident and has stayed with me since, has been an immense support and strength. I'm sooo fortunate. I think it's important to note that to the right person, accommodating your needs as a disabled person won't be a burden. My bowel/urinary system was affected by the nerve damage and my SO has literally cleaned up my poop off the bed without complaint. She loves me, regardless of my ability or inability. My condition has also affected my ability to do much moving during sex. We simply adapt. Ya figure things out. Real love overcomes such things. I know of 2 other paraplegics (one male, one female) who found love after their accidents. They're both happily married to able-bodied partners. Love is love, regardless of disability. 

My faith has helped me as well, and being surrounded by positive, loving and supportive people is so helpful. For me, the mental and emotional aspects of disability have been far worse than the physical, and my support system has been utterly amazing.

I admire the bulldog tenacity of many disabled people. We adapt. Because we have to. Finding a disability community to reach out to on tough days has helped me so much. It's oddly therapeutic when you find people who can relate. Disability is hard, and twice as hard if you're going through it alone. 

I have dropfoot of my right foot too, so I feel ya. I've also experienced improvement in toe function on that foot, so ya never know, you may regain some things. I'm looking into foot surgery myself. I've heard in some cases they can splice a working tendon and connect it to the part of the foot that is dropped. We'll see. It's the least of my worries right now though.

No one wants to let their kids hurt, so it's hard. 

But you have to know that sometimes life is painful and shitty and hard, to understand that the difference isn't the other human, but the situation that human is in.

Even then, kids are going to struggle because they lack the mental and emotional maturity. 

I don't think poorly of the kids who bullied me. We were all in a shitty situation, and I was an easy target. I try not think poorly of the teachers who bullied me and encouraged other kids to do so, but it can be harder to excuse adults for ignorance and poor self regulation and emotional management skills than kids. I try to tell myself ignorance isn't malice, and that I hope they always stay fortunate enough to remain that ignorant, because I wouldn't want anyone to have to suffer in the ways that taught me.

It's clear that you have a great attitude about this and are of goid nature. I know these are mere words, but I think that will get you through this. One last thought, not so much in the way of immediate help, is writing to [Letters Foundation](https://letters.foundation/) to ask for help. It's Warren and Doris Buffett's foundation that gives up to $9,000 to those in need of assistance. Within 10 days of receiving your letter, they contact you to confirm that you are under consideration. I received an email that they're looking over my request, but that was two weeks ago. That's something for you to consider going forward. So, it hasn't been a quick process. 

Do you have health insurance to get the care/meds that you need currently? If not, I recommend Jewish Social Services. They help people of any faith or lack thereof to get care. I'm not sure if they help with finding housing or not. 

My last thought, depending upon your location, would be to see if there's a subreddit for your geographic location. Often, the people there know of other resources that are less well known. People always suggest churches to me, but I'm uncomfortable navigating those, especially as I lack their faith. Someone in a semi-local sub may be able to suggest something in your vicinity, or at least your state, that is more specific.

He says that he has a really hard time staying focused during fights because of his ADD. This kind of blows my mind because if i was locked in a cage with a world-class fighter that was trying to knock my head off, it would be very easy for me to give him 10000% of my attention.

Don't be overly friendly if you feel uncomfortable or unsure what to do, because that can be seen as patronizing.

Don't try to hide it, it will show, trust me. I can always sort of tell when people are disgusted or scared by my disability. They think they're hiding it but their responses are very visible and predictable. My absolutely favorite people are people who manage to just act like people around me, be human, curse, find things cynical and ironic and treat me like a person, no more and no less. It can be really exhausting to always be stared at as though I were an alien. It's a relief when someone doesn't do that with me.

Also, don't assume, ask (if you understand each other... if not, pantomime is one of the most potentially hilarious ways to make friends, in my experience...). Ask what they mean. Ask what they think. Obviously ask what they need. And how, how much, when to stop... give a lot of control and choice to the people you interact with. It's a huge thing to be offered control when you're disabled and / or chronically ill.

Then check what you're doing is what they meant. Then crack a joke if they seem to be into humor... preferably a very awkward, silly joke. Take their needs very seriously and don't do anything they disagree with. Don't take them too seriously though, that's just... they're not a tragedy, they're just dudes. Just be you. 

Sounds like a great thing you're going to do. For them and for you. Hope you enjoy it.",,,3,0,0,

I don’t currently drive- I’ve got my permit but anxiety, too, so that gets in my way. 

Tried Match, okcupid and probably some others...I think I even tried eHarmony even though I’m atheist. I sent *many* unreturned emails, and got some rejections. The only site that was even slightly successful was okcupid - I met a disabled woman, and we went out eight times, and I thought things must be going well. So on that eighth date, I asked where she was with us, and ... she took a big gulp of wine, and I found out we weren’t hitting it off, in her mind. It was awkward after that.

Disability isn't granted based on your condition, but on evidence showing that you can't support yourself through work. Able-bodied people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome or Depression can qualify for Disability because being that unreliable and being incapable of leaving the house or functioning reliably will keep them from keeping employment. Having no legs will not qualify someone, because wheelchairs and desk jobs exist.    


Disability is granted based on your ability to keep a job. ANY job. If you can work as a ticket taker at a movie theater, you can't get Disability. Your job history will be gone through, and they will ask you about every job you've ever had, and why you can't continue to do that. If you can blog, and you can attend school full time, they will ask why you can't work? Especially living in the digital age, it's far easier to work from home at a computer, where all you need is the ability to type. You have to prove that you don't have the training or the ability to do such things.   


You may have a better chance if you use the pain itself as the reason you can't work, if it keeps you from concentrating or being reliable from day to day, but if that's the case, they will ask how you are putting yourself through fulltime school. You might have to prove that the school provides you with special Disabled accommodations that you would not be able to find in any job you are currently qualified for. You might also be asked to justify why you are attending school, and what employment you intend on seeking when you graduate, and how that differs from your current employment possibilities.

I get a time stamp for the length of the line for a ride I want, but instead of trying to wait in line (not that my wheelchair would fit, but even if on crutches or whatever) I can wait somewhere else until it's time then skip to the front and go up a special ramp to park my wheelchair and transfer. All the employees are used to people coming in wheelchairs so it's not a big deal. They have a bathroom near the front of the park (and I think another further back, but I'm not sure where) that is a family bathroom so your caregiver can come in with you and assist you in the bathroom, something overlooked in typical handicapped stalls (though they have those all over the park if that's all you need). They also will let you store medications in the fridge at the first aid station and you can use a bed there if you need a place to administer enteral or parenteral nutrition or meds in a clean environment with privacy. I have really complex needs, and they have always gone above and beyond to accommodate me. 

ETA; To me the biggest issue is that wheelchairs and scooters are offered to rent, and at outrageous prices. I think they should have the rental fee, but you can get a refund if you go to the park services office and get a disability pass. That way people who need them wouldn't be getting charged, but people causing unnecessary wear and tear just to play with one or push their cooler/bags around get charged for it.

c52d51b9-5c84-421d-93a7-69936ae578f9,1549603492,"Right on. To be clear you should provide honest information at all times to SSA as is required by the law and their rules. SSA can and will review bank transactions to see if they are consistent with your reported living arrangement. If you are liable to your landlord (parents in this case) SSA will expect bank transactions to reflect your rental liability. 

Against my own tendency to just be perpetually anxious, I would recommend that you not be anxious about having too much SSI loot. By their rules, SSI is supposed to just cover your basic needs, food and shelter. If you have extra money after your basic needs are met and end up being ineligible for a month or two, the worst that can happen is a month or two without payment or an overpayment that they will recuperate by withholding 10% of your monthly payment. If you are not honest with SSA, you could be investigated for fraud, and could face criminal penalties. As long as you are honest and follow their rules by promptly reporting changes and income, the worst outcome is generally reduced payment (with ways of negotiating the payment reduction depending on your needs).

If you are hoping to save money to get your own place, you can first invest in exempted resources, like personal effects (such as pots and pans, furniture, a broom, dish rack and garbage cans) before saving up for a rental deposit. In most cases it is acceptable to prepay for rent or other expenses like a phone bill as long as the prepayment could not be construed as giving away money (prepaying friends or family members may be construed as a gift rather than payment for service unless documented otherwise and giving away money can make you ineligible for SSI). I recommend talking with responsible family, friends or counselors you trust if you want help making a plan and budgeting for your goals. For exempted resources see [https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0501110210](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0501110210).

I cannot say definitely what SSA may consider a large cash withdrawal, that is in part at the discretion of representatives at your local office. From my experience, however, if someone has a large cash withdrawal (over $200 or so) or frequent small cash withdrawals (like $20 per day for 2 weeks), SSA can consider the total of that cash as a held resource unless proven otherwise. To avoid any issues, I generally recommend keeping receipts or documentation of cash purchases around or above $100. To be safe, keep receipts for all cash purchases, at least above $20. In inquiring about your resources, SSA will ask how much cash you have and you have a legal obligation to answer honestly. 

If you did not specifically ask your attorney about these issue, it is unlikely they would tell you. Most attorneys representing people trying to get SSI, are focused on helping you establish medical eligibility and do not necessarily give tips about the non medical (financial) eligibility unless specifically asked. That said, if you still have an attorney working on your case, you should please disregard my general information and ask your attorney for specific advise. Best wishes!

Unfortunately, it was sadly inaccessible.

One of the ways CP affects me is my vision, specifically the muscles of my eyes. Your videos were too fast! With the constant high speed movement it was impossible to focus. I watched one video and couldn't see much but decided to try one more video to see if things changed. By the end of the second video I was suffering real eye strain and feeling physical pain as well as feeling physically ill.

Also, due to hearing issues I need captions. Your open subtitles are inadequate and frustrating. Where I live I only have access to ~~very slow internet~~ the slowest possible internet that is considered broadband internet. Often, I need to use lower video qualities to be able to stream. When captions or subtitles are open like yours they can be impossibly blurry when not viewed in high quality. When closed captions are used instead it also means that my computer's custom accessibility settings will automatically apply and the text will change color, style and size to fit my needs. It makes a world of difference to me.

With my specific disabilities watching videos often means viewing once to catch all of the audio and viewing a second time to catch all the visual information so simply due to time constraints I have to be really choosy in my streaming.

He took one look at me, didn't actually touch me or do anything, and said ""Well, lotsa people have lotsa pain."" Then he sent me on my way.

Sometimes I look back on it and wonder if that was a prank.",,,4,0,0,

Have you spoken with your psychologist about wanting to use a wheelchair? They'd possibly be the most relevant starting point in determining if wheelchair use is appropriate for you. 

Additionally, are you seeing a physical therapist? Even *if* wheelchair use is appropriate for you, receiving regular PT, having a device properly fit to you, knowing how to use it correctly, etc is essential. 

I'm not a doctor and this is not medical advice, but just going and getting a wheelchair can be a poor decision for a number of reasons. Work with your doctors, therapists, and PT to come up with a healthy and appropriate solution for you. ",,,5,0,0,

I did not sign paperwork on being hired regarding my disabilities. As my spinal cord injury and Ehlers Danlos were diagnosed a few months into working, however I did use a cane and back brace upon being hired.

Currently I've got my [eye on one on Amazon that's about $160](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000V53KD8), plus [$30-40 for the handles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001PQMGA0) which replace the pedals. It doesn't have much beyond a timer and a dial to increase or decrease resistance. The one you're used to looks like it tracks your workout, maybe your vitals, how much energy expended, and possibly has an option to automatically change resistances so it seems like you're going up and down hills. For my money, most of that stuff can either be figured out on my smartphone/manually or just ignored, so I'm fine with the sub $200 price for my setup (also, space being at a premium...).

I feel like your workout will be fairly cardio intensive either way, though the larger machines do have a few possible advantages. The biggest of which is that if you're larger/stronger than most, the floor machine would be much more stable than a table top unit unless the latter is bolted down. Another possible advantage is that with the space and electrical usage, the floor machine may be able to take advantage of electromagnets to push resistances far beyond that of which a table model is capable (purely conjecture, I have no idea if any floor models use electromagnets or if they can crank them well beyond a table top model and am basing this on physics alone)",,,1,0,0,

Typically it's to make sure you're not abusing the drugs they give you, but I'm not sure how they'd react to you using pot if it's illegal in your state.

If you haven't seen a neurologist, that'd be a good step, too.

c52d51b9-5c84-421d-93a7-69936ae578f9,1550188763,"Short answer yes, but not necessarily.

Many different neurological and psychological conditions may impair our ability to do work related tasks and may impair our ability to interact with other people. A variety of conditions can make it difficult to respond appropriately to supervision, to be able to work with other people without excessive distractions or disruptions, and to be able to relate to and communicate with people in ways considered socially appropriate in a work place.  Many different conditions may limit our relative ability to understand and remember instructions, to be able to pay attention and stay on task, to be able to work at a fast enough pace, and to be able to exercise judgment considered socially appropriate.  

Many people with disabilities are able to work and hold a job. Many people with disabilities are not able to work and hold a regular job. People who have been unable to hold a job are not necessarily disabled, but may benefit from a screening for disabilities.

If you or someone you know has significant difficulty in any of these areas, or has been unable to hold a job despite their best efforts, I strongly recommend that checking with a career center or vocational training center in your area to see if they offer assessments for disability and help with job training and placement for people with disabilities, help with requesting workplace accommodations for people with disabilities and referrals for disability benefits.",,,3,0,0,
