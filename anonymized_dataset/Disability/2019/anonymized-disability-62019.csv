4.) On the date of my next hearing I will not be bringing my service dog. I will leave him outside with a friend as to not cause any sort of disturbance.

There’s two programs, SSDI and SSI. SSI is if you have not paid in enough through working, and the most that you can collect a month from SSI is $770. That will not get you far. Depending on your state you may also be eligible for food stamps and you should be eligible for Medicaid.

SSDI on the other hand pays more typically then SSI. Since you are young even if you have been working the amount that you would get paid would not be a great deal more, but you can check that out online by setting up an account for yourself so you can see how much you might expect to get on disability. On SSDI you have to wait two years in order to be eligible for Medicare. If your finances are low enough you may be eligible through your state for Medicaid in the meantime. Also SSI limits you on the amount of non-earned income and the amount of assets you have, so you cannot collect a lot of savings. On SSDI they’re only concerned with earned income, you can collect lottery winnings, inheritance, gifts from people, without any negative impact to your benefit.

65cd786b-2cb4-4e65-b4dc-934bc5caf43f,1560911183,"I applied for SSDI in Kentucky and was approved. My disability is much different (bipolar disorder) but in my experience, there are two things that will drastically help your application. 

The first is a long and documented medical history, with doctor's notes and hospital visits, proving the medical extent of your disability. A definitive diagnosis from a doctor's records will also help. I know fibromyalgia is a difficult diagnosis to ""prove"" but if you have seen doctors on a regular basis, their findings will help prove the medical side of your disability claim.

The second is a history of unsuccessful attempts to work, with your disability being the reason that you can no longer work. They would like to see you have tried different jobs, switching careers, doing easier work, etc. and have attempted to work in any capacity, but unsuccessfully kept a job due to your disability. An ""unsuccessful work attempt"" is defined as six months or less at a particular job. [More info about UWAs](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0411010145)

[This page about SSDI and fibromyalgia might help you too.](https://www.disabilitysecrets.com/resources/social-security-disability-ssdi-ssi-fibromyalgia.htm)

Even with a rock solid case, you might have to wait months or years to get approved unfortunately. You may also be denied the first time, as 60% of cases are. 

It may help to get a disability lawyer to navigate the process and ensure everything is buttoned up before submission. Be aware though, if you have been disabled for a long time, you may receive a large back payment (maybe $20k or more). Disability lawyers work on a percentage of that payment, so the more you are entitled to, the more money they take as a fee. [More information about that here](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/when-can-social-security-disability-lawyer-take-more-than-6000-your-backpay.html).

Honesty is the best policy when telling a child about his or her disability. Understanding helps with acceptance. 
There are sports and other activities geared towards disabled children. Try getting the child to focus on what they can do instead of what they can’t. Getting your child involved in adaptive sports is a great way for him/her to make friends that have their own challenges to overcome.

2185bb4c-aebc-4db1-a4ee-bb3ca666c8ff,1560587700,"I can’t speak from a disability perspective but I have a chronic illness and I often refer to myself as sick or ill. It’s an intrinsic part of who I am - I was born with it and inherited from other members of my family who were also born with it, so it feels like being sick, to me, is just as much who I am as my gender, race, sexuality, etc. I don’t see it as being a victim, but just a state of being, and I don’t feel that I’m a survivor because statistically, my chronic illness will in fact eventually kill me, either directly or indirectly, so I really haven’t survived anything except not dying yet. 

That said, I think this is a different situation than someone who has had a profound but acute illness or medical trauma such as a stroke - strokes are not chronic or congenital illnesses so it makes less sense for someone who has had a stroke to identify as ill. At the same time, the after-effects of something like stroke can be a long term, chronic problem so I also see the opposite argument. 

Anyway, basically I would say personally I don’t really think there is anything wrong with identifying as ill or sick, and sometimes I think it is worthwhile to focus on those concepts as an identity, but as with most things in life, you can’t really make a blanket statement that will be true for all people and situations so it ultimately depends.",,,5,0,0,
f4d18fa8-4341-4c9e-9b7b-df64934a1b8c,1561627721,"I use taxi services to get to the community centre where I study, volunteer and do some paid work. I take a taxi because it's my only transport option for this particular commute, if I didn't have my disability I could probably drive myself, or take the bus it even walk/ride my bike since it's only ~5km away.

For me, the main thing is reliability, I book my taxis in advance but I often find myself booking an uber last minute because the taxi company forgot about my booking or cancelled last minute because they double booked and I had the shorter journey.

This makes me look unprofessional and flaky when I'm showing up to work late.

The second thing for me is that this is just part of my routine commute to work/social events etc, I want it to be normalised and not to have my disability be a big to do. People don't get treated like royalty when they drive themselves to work, if I was treated like royalty on my way to work part of me would feel almost like they're taking a helpful service too far in the other direction and making it some kind of inspiration porn. Why do I need special treatment? All I want is an accessible service that treats me with a basic level of respect. 

I think having options such as ""standard transportation: for everyday trips, errands and commutes"" and also ""the royal experience: for special events, parties or just to treat yourself"" so people can choose. Though this would probably be something to consider if you had multiple vans and could do each one up differently. 

This ties in with my third opinion that a themed van is a bit kitche, and personally would not appeal to me, currently when I rock up in a taxi, the only question people ask is ""hey, why did you get a taxi, you don't drive?"" and I can answer a variety of ways from the evasive ""my partner has the car today"" to the open and honest ""yeah, my disability prevents me from driving""

But if I showed up to work in a van with cartoon characters on it, there would be a lot of questions such as ""who's van is that?"" or ""Why do you take the magic school bus to work?"" and if it explain about the service ""oh, it's a disability service.... Is that the van they usually use for kids, you know clients can see you getting out of that car right?""

Van decals can be fun, but I'm an adult trying to work in a government industry and I don't like drawing that kind of attention to myself. It's hard enough to find the balance between being a representative for people with disabilities in my industry and not letting my organisation flaunt me as a token disabled person, while also just wanting to normalise my disability so it doesn't even need to be a talking point beyond making sure things are accessible to me.

Certain disabilites can mean that people enjoy the cuter wimsy of a cartoon, some of the other people in the all abilities choir Im in love wearing mickey mouse ears 24/7 and that's their personality, it's what they like. Personally I don't like that, so when someone implies that because I have a disability I should like things aimed at kids, it's infantising, and too many people with disabilities suffer from being systematically infantalised.


But these are totally just my thoughts, it will depend on your target demographic, maybe after you get a few regular clients you can ask them to vote on a van design as a group, this could also serve as a marketing tool to encourage customer/client interaction and engagement with the company.",,,1,0,0,

I see “wheelchair user” a lot more now, and “full-time” or “part-time” to describe whether it is used for more or less all mobility (outside sleeping, bathing, etc) or just some.

Basically, language can influence attitudes and this newer language shifts the focus from thinking of wheelchairs as something you’re stuck in to thinking of them as tools that can be used to do more and make things easier. Language isn’t the root of all ableism, but it can still contribute to and perpetuate it. But also, like others have said, you get to decide what language you use to describe yourself.

Anyway, when my lawyer gave me forms for my *doc* to fill out, they were much more brief, had concrete questions about the diagnosis, and a scale to rate functionality on. My lawyer advised me to think like an SSA evaluator...what do I need to defend my decision that this applicant is disabled:

1. Diagnosis (What’s wrong?)
2. Concrete proof of diagnosis (Physical/cognitive/etc. test results)
3. Proof that the diagnosis impacts functionality so much that the applicant cannot work (how does diagnosis/severity/totality of health issues impact functionality)

This lawyer was sufficiently experienced be able to taylor a short form with basically two parts: Diagnosis/proof, and functional impacts. It was easy to fill out and interpret.

This open ended stuff like in the form provided by OP...is a field of landmines. It is so easy to not know what to put, accidentally write something ambiguous, forget to put in an impact, or just be exhausted by the end of the first six page form! And then the evaluator has to piece together everything from an unclear layout and whatever the exhausted doc wrote.

A skilled lawyer or “application assistant” would have a more succinct form that is easier to both fill out and interpret. 

Again, totally agreeing with you that this is similar to some of the open ended junk the SSA has; just saying that unless the SSA has provided that form for use, there are much better ways to get the info across.",,,2,0,0,

So seeing (actually at this point mostly hearing about him) compared with my son, I can see the huge difference it makes to realize that a child has problems and do something about it, while his dad was tied to mom's apron strings, and he was always told that everything he did was wonderful even when it wasn't. I felt like with my son I always had to go through the backdoor or window or any crack I could inf to reach him. While he will never be completely 'normal' (who is?) he functions so well. He has a full time and a part-time job. The FT he has been there long enough that when the boss goes on vacation or has to take a day off, HE is in charge! His dad has never seemed to make any inroads at all. We got out first grandbaby last year after my older son and his wife had been trying for years. So what does his dad say when he hears that they are pregnant? ""It had better be a boy, I'll be upset if it is a girl!"" Besides, of course, it being none of his business! Well, that train had already left the station as once you are pregnant you can't change the sex of the baby and I was ecstatic to learn I would have a girl grandbaby!!!!

e0aaa745-47b2-46c5-85b2-fff334054a7c,1559756021,"SEF's mom  --  About a month ago my son sef mentioned that he was scared about what would happen if something happened to my husband, his step-dad, because I can't live alone. Interesting insight as I'm not used to them coming from my autistic son. The older one knows that I need help just to be sure I haven't fallen, but he won't bring it up until a time it might be needed. So yep, I also can't live alone. I have severe RA and every joint pretty much has RA or OA, both knees replaced and then redone already and I'm only 63! My back is a total mess as well. Needless to say that when walking, I use a cane even in the house as I am rather wobbly. My last fall ended up with an ambulance ride to the ER and the most excruciating pain in my life and I have had a baby over 10# and I have had kidney stones and the pain was far worse than that. The point being if hubby hadn't heard me go down or if I lived alone I would definitely need one of those, ""help I've fallen and I can't get up"" gadgets. More and more things are impossible for me to do. I have always been very independent, something my mom made sure hubby knew before marrying me. 6 weeks later, I never went back to work and it took most of a year to figure out what was wrong with me. So Miss Independent, suddenly needed help showering, dressing, walking, cooking, doing household tasks. You guys know the list.

&amp;#x200B;

17 years in with this battle, I am used to my life even though every year I am losing more and more ability. I have made a choice that I am not going to Miss Gloom and doom. Every day I try to find something to be thankful for. I try to share gratitude to anyone who helps me. I am no longer embarrassed to ask for help. A little startling for a teenage boy to have an older woman ask for help opening her water bottle since I can no longer to that on my own. Years ago I had to give up on my favorite apple juice since I couldn't open it at all! But the thing I like the best is if an elementary sized boy on his own opens and holds a door for me. WOW, do you realize how many kids never think about doing that?!? So with something like that I try to look him in the eye and say not only thank you but that I appreciate it. Especially one day when the kid doing it, dad had walked through the door and never noticed me and he didn't notice what his son was doing and yelled at him to hurry up. Obviously not learning manners from dad, but hopefully, a little incidence where someone disabled needs help and they give it and get real appreciation back might stick with him so that he grows up to be a sensitive helpful man.

 I have learned to take any help offered. Think about it this way, if you weren't in a chair or hobbling along with a cane/crutch, wouldn't you be reaching out to help others? I'm assuming that the answer is yes. So maybe you can't help currently, but you can allow someone to practice their little acts of random kindness on you. Be thankful that people will still help whether you have to ask for help or not. I have also found that when a child of any age asks questions about why I use a cane or why I have such (ugly) scars on my knees. They don't say ugly, but I know they are. It gives me a chance to educate them about a disease or difficulty that they may not be aware of. For me to say that I have arthritis, isn't too impressive as they may know something with a sore finger that they call arthritis. and then they want to tell me what will 'cure' me. I hate it when I hear about a product that my doc 'doesn't want me to know about because they would lose money!"" But many haven't knowingly run into people with what you have very much and if there were magic potions my doc would have tried them. I've even gotten to educate some young girls as to my using a cane, they thought I was blind. So they got two lessons for the price of one. 

&amp;#x200B;

Try to get up every day in an attitude of gratitude. Be thankful for what you have and can do. Pass out smiles if you have nothing else to give.

Regardless of people's abilities they should be considerate and show proper etiquette when interacting in public places. Sure, there are people whose medical problems may prevent them from doing things to the full extent one would expect from an abled body person, but that is not the reality for majority of the population.  It would be super unfair to have the store lower their standards of general cleanliness or let customer accountability  slide for all on the account that's it may be difficult for a small portion of the population to do things or that it may come off as offensive to some. Why do people get mad at misplaced things? Because there are a lot of people who(for lack of a better phrase) ""abuse the system"" and don't think or care about the messes they leave behind. The retail workers are then left to pick up after them like mothers after toddlers. It's a small expectation of decency that everyone should be taught and have in adulthood (like not leaving a dirty toilet seat basic).

People are not mind readers and it is impossible for them to mentally account/accommodate for every possible thing under the sun that may impact a stranger they know nothing about(that's exhausting and an impossibly unrealistic expectation to ask them to carry).  You want people to be treated with equal respect? Then there needs to be a general baseline on how you interact with everyone in the population... and adjust accordingly to other information(whether verbal or other). 

 If you have trouble with something, ask for assistance. If you see someone may need help, ask. If no one is there to help(like reaching or picking things up), leave it in an area that is as close to the original site as possible and out of the way. Do things within your limit and be considerate. Disabilities should not give people an a pass to forgo their sense of etiquette. If something is difficult communicate it. Most people are generally decent human beings and will offer some accomodations when they are made aware of limiting situations.

By the way, this sense of respect goes both ways. If you ask for accommodations for your disability then turn around and leave an unnecessary, inconsiderate mess behind, then you're just being an asshole(disabled or not).",,,4,0,0,

They legally have to provide you accessible housing that meets your needs from what they offer (so if none of their rooms have private bathrooms then they can’t really provide that). They don’t legally have to pay for off campus apartments, unless they literally had no accessible dorm rooms which I can’t imagine. I was allowed to take 5 years to graduate instead of the traditional 4, and I was allowed to take a semester off without any consequences for health reasons. The accommodations I had were extended testing time, taking tests by computer, no loss of points for absences, note takers in my classes or the ability to tape record, having a TA tape record class sessions when I was absent, access to the professors notes or power point printouts, ability to reschedule tests if sick, access to restricted elevators, and transportation between campuses (main campus and education campus).

To be legally disabled it must be determined that he is no longer capable of *any* work, including sedentary work. They consider age, work history, diagnosis, and severity in considering what work he may be able to do.

If he can no longer work, the best thing to do is consult an attorney. They take their fees out of the disability back pay when you are awarded, and they are legally limited in how much they are allowed to charge. This will ensure you receive representation regardless of ability to pay up front.

Take getting a lawyer very seriously if your father needs to be on disability. I was seeing 7 specialists, had had multiple surgeries, and was losing my ability to walk when I was denied disability. Their own doctor assigned to examine me from the government stated I was disabled and they still denied me. You will almost certainly get denied without a lawyer.  

I won on appeal after I got a lawyer. The judge told me she had never seen so much evidence in a single case, apologized to me personally and threw the old judgement out, but took me THREE YEARS to get in front of her after the initial denial.

While all medical records are considered, those from the past year are weighted more heavily because it is a recent picture of how you are doing.  So they will get you into a CE with one of their doctors so they can add recent medical info to your case so it can be decided and closed.  You might want to reach out to your DDS examiner and inform them of your upcoming cardiology consultation, even if it is weeks or months out.  It might be better for your case to be paused now waiting for your cardiology results than denied before you see the specialist.  It would take longer to appeal or file a new claim than waiting until you’ve seen the cardiologist and had those tests.  Don’t be afraid of expressing that you’d like all the evidence available before they decide your case

If your heart is one of your disabling conditions and you’ve not seen a specialist for it recently, you need to do so ASAP.  My brother in law was having palpitations that were taking his breath at times.  His family doctor tried to get him into a cardiologist, but it was weeks out.  He finally went to the ER and the doctor there got him a priority appointment with that hospital system’s cardiology team.  If you are having problems, it might be worth a try to see if you could get in with a hospital system’s team of specialists.

845fdcb5-95f0-4d11-9b0b-ee5b3e7ffe34,1561052376,"Disneyland proper isn't quite as wheelchair friendly since it's such an old park. The walkways are tighter and most of the older rides (especially in Fantasyland) will issue you a return time equal to the current standby wait time to come back through the exit. California Adventure is much newer and basically every single ride can accommodate your chair or ECV.

Disney World is very spread out with it's 4 parks and dozens of resorts. All buses, boats and Monorail can transport your wheelchair or ECV. You can also rent a Minnie Van for transport through the Lyft App but it's pretty pricey.

The Disability Access Service (known as the DAS Pass) is meant for any disabilities that prevent you from waiting in a standard line and works the same at both Disneyland and WDW. This means if a wheelchair solves your issues, you do not need to apply, as the lines can automatically accommodate you either by being wide enough for your chair to go through as normal or issuing a return time for the exit entrance, the Cast Members will let you know what to do at each attraction. If you do qualify for a DAS Pass, you will walk to the ride you wish to go on and the Cast Member will issue you a return time that is equal to the current standby wait time. You will then come back at your time (or any point after your time comes up, it does not expire until the end of the day) and you will go through the Fast Pass line. 

You can only hold one return time at a time. Disney no longer offers any kind of front of the line instant access like in the old days unless you go through the Make A Wish program.

Most parades and fireworks have wheelchair seating but it is first come first serve. Disneyland is busy basically all the time thanks to the locals, so get to events that are important to you early.

There are no discounts for disabled folks or their caretakers. 

For Disneyland we stayed at the Holiday Inn and Express on Manchester and it was an easy 8 minute walk to the park. You don't need to stay at one of the expensive hotels at Disneyland in order to have easy access. There are dozens of much cheaper places to stay literally right across the street from the gate.

I highly recommend paying for the Max Pass system at Disneyland, it's $15 per person per day. This function lets you book your Fast Passes from your phone with the official App instead of having to physically travel to each individual ride and pulling a paper Fast Pass. You can also book a Fast Pass every 90 minutes instead of 2 hours, and it also includes ALL of your photos from the day for free. It's an absolute steal and a life saver when you have limited physical endurance.

WDW offers 3 free Fast Passes per day per person. You book these in advance: 60 days for onsite guests, 30 days for offsite guests. They must all be in the same park. Once you use all 3 for the day, you can book an additional Fast Pass depending on availability. You can use both DAS and Fast Passes at the same time together.

Feel free to ask me any questions, as I went to both WDW, Disneyland and Universal within the last year and am very current with their Disability policies.",,,4,0,0,

For std you need to be disabled from your specific occupation. For example a fireman needs to lift 100 pounds, a retail clerk needs to be on their feet all day, etc. 

Your doctor tells std what restrictions you have. So for example “ needs ability to sit or stand for comfort as needed”.  Std (assuming they agree) then compares what you can’t do to what your occupation requires you do. Any overlap and you’re approved. 

You have what’s called a sedentary occupation with ability to wah. Very unlikely from a physical standpoint you have restrictions that preclude you from working. You could actually be in a wheelchair and still not precluded from your occupation as honestly it is not at all physically demanding. 

However it is mentally intensive. You have to maintain focus and problem solve. Likely express your thoughts to others fairly frequently. Painkillers will often help physical pain but at the price of dulling you mentally. Someone on opiate painkillers for example shouldn’t drive, work at heights or around machinery as part of their job due to safety risks. 

If you feel your pain and/or medication is making you unable to mentally perform your job I would have that discussion with your care provider. Explain you aren’t wanting to file for social security disability but you can’t meet demands of your specific job right now (as opposed to permanently). 

Cognitive deficits are obviously harder to “prove”  than physical ailments but can be just as disabling. 

Hope some of this is helpful.  Cheers.",,,2,0,0,

39049bf8-b0e9-4c11-a45f-8cafb019a1bc,1561888157,"Here in the US people with disabilities sometimes have a choice depending on their abilities, ""cognitive levels"" and needs. Off the top of my head: living on your own with no support, living with family, living on your own with someone to help you get up and dressed and back into bed, care-homes, varying nursing facilities, supportive living and independent living.

I have worked in both an adult day program and an supportive/independent living agency. I have over 20 years of experience. Here is my perspective and opinion.

At the adult day program  the adults were not eligible to be in any work program because their disabilities were too profound. These adults were mostly non-verbal and needed support in most of their daily needs like toileting, eating and socializing. 

Of 50 clients, ages 18-75, only 15 had any family contact. Of those 15, only 5 lived at home. The remaining 10 lived in care homes or skilled nursing facilities because the family simply did not have the emotional, financial or physical ability to care for them properly anymore.

The rest were in care homes or a skilled nursing facility, and all were wards of the State. In other words, most were abandoned at a young age by the family. No contact at all. Their ages ranged from 25-75.

The clients I worked with at the agency fell into many areas. Most want to be away from family because, well they are adults. Or parents wanted their children to grow. Most had contact with family, visited at holidays and did the normal adult thing we all do: date, work, school, recreation.

1. My state shut down the state hospitals because of the rampant abuse and neglect (and cost). Those who did not return home or go into care-homes etc, were placed in agencies like ours. They were placed in apartments equipped with staff (me) who taught them decision making skills, and independence to the best of their ability. 

2. Adults still needing help who wanted to leave their family to gain more independence. Some are \*Conserved\*, others are not. Again, staff is there to assist them in their independence to the best of their ability. HOW MUCH help they need is assessed and the State deems how many staff hours they get. Most of these clients can and will find a work program of some sort.

3. Adults who are capable of living on their own, and capable of doing everything themselves with the exception of a few things go to Independent Living. Here a staff may pop in 1x a week to be sure all is well in the hygiene, cleanliness and bill paying department. They too are likely working in some capacity.

\*conserved means the parent still makes all of the client's decisions such as medical, financial, social situations because the client was deemed incapable of making such decisions. Sometimes it sucks because you sometimes have a client who is perfectly capable of making shopping decisions or wanting to date and the parent says No.",,,5,0,0,

I doubt you were working at 14 so you may only qualify for SSI. You can see your earnings record if you sign up for an account on [My SSA](https://secure.ssa.gov/SiView.action). If you have had enough quarters to qualify for SSDI, it will show an estimate of what you'd receive. It's based on how much you have contributed from your wages. (The part of your paycheck that says FICA.)

SSI has asset limits; you can keep your car and the house that you live in (if you own it), and $2000 in a bank account. But there are special types of savings accounts that you should research if you are approved. 

Other people have described the actual process. Be very thorough in listing your doctors, hospitalizations, medical tests, and medications. My memory isn't great so I went through my calendar to look up appointments I had, and my contacts on my phone to remember doctors names. Look up insurance statements and medical payments you've made. Your mom might be able to help. You can also get a list of your past prescriptions from your pharmacy (at least major ones like Walgreens and CVS). Be sure to make a list of any side effects you have from your current medications that affect your functioning, for example fatigue or dizziness. 

Basically they look at your functioning and not your diagnosis. Also your qualifications and your past work history. You may be able to physically do the job of a scientist but if you don't have a degree or work experience, then they can't suggest that.

Above all, be honest and consistent. Don't exaggerate **or** donwplay your symptoms.

I found a studio apartment right next door, so I think as far as dorms go I’m gonna say “private accessible dorm all four years or being allowed to live off campus” I’d rather live on campus, but if they won’t give that then this would be alternative. 

Sorry about your college! That sounds like an awful situation. I guess the best mindset for me would be to achieve the highest I can. So going to the best college I can, but not if that college would result in me getting lower grades than another college purely due to their lack of accommodations. 

Yeah and I feel like an initial meeting would really set the tone for how I should expect to be treated there, that and their students. So if they’re putting up a fight and making every little accommodation seem like they’re being generous... I’m not gonna want that headache for their next four years on top of already existing stress of school and medical life.

I am living with CP and have gone to a few festivals and had some fun nights of clubbing Hopefully what I have to say will be helpful.

I almost exclusively go to these events in my wheelchair. That said, I will commonly stand for the first and last five minutes or so to be eye level with my companions. I cannot stand for much longer than that and it sounds like we might have stamina issues in common.

I am not sure what your “many health issues” are so I don’t know that my experiences will be a helpful guide to you, but if you permit a long post here it is.

Being Treated Well

I’ve been treated badly a few times mostly out of ignorance and concern on the part of event staff.

Roughly half the time I go to festivals the security tell me that my wheelchair dance moves are dangerous and I need to stop. I explain that wheelies are my version of jumping up and down to the beat. If they don’t listen I wait for them to go away and than start the party again.

Several of my fellow ravers have treated me amazingly though. Many times someone has pushed me to the front with their crew when they saw I was struggling to move through the crowd. One time w bodybuilder lifted me up so I could see the lights and the stage (after making sure that was all good medically) 

I can’t speak for all music scenes, but EDM listeners are typically very accepting, kind, people with a few a-holes mixed in.


Access

It is very hard for me to get around festivals in my 
wheelchair. The events are crowded, grassy, and muddy. For the grass and mud I recommend bringing strong friends if you can. 

For the crowd I have another peace of advice CLAIM YOUR SPACE. Even nice people won’t see you in a crowd. If you need to go forward and people are in your way don’t be afraid to tap their ankles with your footplate. This will actually get them to recognize your presence. If you can’t weave through a crowd like and able person physical advertisements of your existence are a must.

Once you find a dance spot you like, stick with it for a while. Have your friends spread out and eventually the crowd will recognize that the space is not to be infringed upon.


Special Areas

I totally agree with you that paying more for a more accessible experience is a good thing if you have the option. Most of the outdoor festivals I’ve been to either don’t have specific areas for disabled people to dance, or they do, but those areas make you feel removed from the experience. 

Festivals do have VIP tickets. I’ve never been able to get those, but depending on the show they might give you more room to spread out.


Safety 

In my experience the crowd protects wheelchair users if they notice something wrong. One time a drunk guy knocked me out of my chair and a near by military guy  picked him up by his neck and threw him out of the club. 

That said, it’s always good to have an escape plan. I usually dance toward the back. In the wheelchair I can’t see anything anyway and there is roughly 10x more room per person in the back. 

I will also pick a specific exit route (if I’m in a club it’ll be a particular door, if I’m at a festival it’ll be making my way to a landmark outside of the action). All my friends know where I might go beforehand and I go there if it gets too crazy or my legs start cramping up.

Yet I’ve been asked many times because my resume says “medical leave of absence” or “disability leave of absence.” It especially confuses people in person because my disability is a mental illness, and doesn’t have any outward physical signs, so they feel compelled to know more. 

Usually I just say that it was a personal medical issue that required several hospital stays, but that I’m looking to go back to work now that it seems the worst of it is over. Some have pried into it even more than that. Recruiters seem especially nosy.

I think I’ll probably decline to answer in the future, because it only seems to hurt my chances of being hired, and never has it helped.

Since the establishments began eliminating plastic straws we have tried the alternatives but each have insurmountable issues. Steel reusable straws are hard to keep clean and rust free. Paper/pulp straws (probably hemp type ones too) are no good for hot coffee and fall apart and/or drop particles into the coffee which is a much inferior coffee experience compared to an able person’s.

I agree it would be great to eliminate plastic straws but the replacement should fulfill the utility of plastic straws.

Service dogs perform a very large number of tasks for their owners. There is no way to compile a complete list. This is why there is no national certification for service dogs. They have to be trained for various jobs and those jobs differ from handler to handler. Some alerts cannot even be trained, they come naturally to that particular pup. If someone gives you a certificate, they were scammed :(  


They might be an alert dog for epilepsy, narolepsy, low blood sugar as examples. They may perform physical duties such as being a counter balance for someone having trouble walking and keeping balance; I saw a little person on tv use his pitbull like you would use a crutch or walker; they can fetch objects and open doors. The most well known is guiding the blind -- they also can help Deaf people.  They might help someone with anxiety or autism by providing a weight on their stomach/chest (I'm not sure which, they are doing more than a emotional support animal because they are doing that specific task and not just existing.) These are just the tasks I've noted when I was looking into a service dog.  


There are service dog users on Youtube that can be living examples for you. You can also learn more about service dogs by watching them in action. I found those channels by putting ""service dog"" in the search field.  


BTW, a real service dog is highly trained and well behaved. If a dog is misbehaving and disruptive (bothering other customers for example, not calmly siting or laying down when their handler is sitting for example) they are likely a fake service dog.  You are allowed to kick disruptive dogs out, just as you would kick out any other customer who is being disruptive.  Note you cannot kick out a behaving service dog because someone is scared of dogs though, the dog has to be honestly making a commotion or creating problems). Of course I'm assuming you have that kind of policy.",,,10,0,0,

One looked at me and shook his head and said I was too young for this (knee replacements). The next doctor looked at me and said I was too old for this (wisdom teeth extraction)! We put off the knee replacement until just walking into the grocery store for milk, I would be in so much pain I would be in tears. In the waiting to be able to do the knees, I was put on a NSAID which gave me several bleeding ulcers at once and meant that when diagnosed with RA I couldn't take the first line of medications offered - NSAIDS. So for that, I was in a pickle to start with. Then we got the teeth out as the one he as most concerned with had an abscess starting under it. That left me with nerve damage and not able to feel half my tongue, half my lower jaw. I aspirated as well as pocketed food. Eventually had to have micro-surgery that I had to fly out to the doctor. It was partially successful as I got about 80% sensation back. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, I'm not going to wait around until I am too old or use stop-gap measures if something can be done now. I don't know what you might need surgery on, but what is your quality of life now and what is the probability of your quality of life possible if you go through the surgery now?

I would encourage you to talk to your parents about this. Be open and honest about how much it bothers you, and ask them to help you.

And bring specific ideas on how things can be improved. Maybe things like if you're in your room with the door shut then your siblings are not allowed to knock or bother you. Or if you have your headphones on outside your room then your siblings cannot bother you.

In addition, you could consider talking to your siblings about this. Sometimes younger siblings bother older siblings because they look up to them and just want to be around them. Maybe you could schedule specific one-on-one time with them, where they get your attention to just talk or play. That may help satisfy their desire to spend time with you and be more willing to give you alone-time.

As a child my disabilities were invisible (autism/ADHD) and kids avoided me.....and still do.... I never asked about this because I could never articulate that something about me was different, it's not something you can't ignore like a physical disability, or a quantifiable difference

But I would see the quantifiable differences between myself and other kids and I would point them out to my mom. ""Mom, why do other kids have dads and I don't?"" And apparently it broke her heart so much she sent me to go visit my dad. This ended very badly for me.

If we could do it over I wish she could have explained diversity to me. That sometimes we are surrounded by diversity and sometimes we just ARE the diversity. Sometimes other people that aren't as diverse don't understand diversity, because there isn't enough around them. Sometimes they haven't learned about it yet, and because no one has taught them, they don't understand it. Kids tend to avoid things they don't understand, like idk broccoli. It sucks when other people don't do their jobs and teach about diversity. Injustice sucks.

Idk how to convey any of that to a child, though. But as you've noticed, kids do see the differences. They do take it in. We absorb it one way or another, and it's up to us to guide them as best we can in a nurturing direction that helps their self esteem. Just make sure your kid knows it's not their fault other kids suck. That they aren't broken because they're disabled, that diversity is important and that they contribute differently. I like to think of humans as being a big team. Some people do the heavy lifting, some people do the planning, some people design, some people execute. We're all working together. Even if all you have to offer is your support for other people like you, that's valid. Again, kinda hard to convey to a kid.

How fussy is she with her hair? If you put in little clips in will she pull them out? [Barrettes](http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/200873905638-0-1/s-l1000.jpg) or [claw clips](http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/331387254164-0-1/s-l1000.jpg) are great for little girls, especially if they're fancy colours or have cute things stuck on them. If she's still sticking things in her mouth, skip the clips and go for larger barrettes. She can pick them out herself which makes brushing and doing hair fun family time rather than a chore. Headbands are comfortable, also in lots of colours and on in no time flat. 

How old is your son, would he help with your daughters hair? I cut my siblings hair as a kid as I was the oldest, it was a nice bonding moment for us. Boys though so no hairstyles!

bcd2197d-ea88-4998-8bab-6fb955ee0e74,1561313003,"Hey, I have CRPS. It sucks but there is definitely hope for learning to manage it. Some things to know, if you don't already:

1) With CRPS your sympathetic (flight or fight) nervous system is stuck ""on."" That means stress, anxiety, etc all increase the pain you feel. At the beginning, I had to work really hard at relaxing my sympathetic nervous system, but I've seen really good results, personally. I meditate twice a day and at the beginning I did restorative yoga or yoga nidra every day. Insight Timer, a meditation app, has a $5 course called ""methods for dealing with pain and illness"" that I got a LOT out of. I know that sounds like not enough, but trust me. 

2) A lot of doctors don't really understand CRPS. Plus, early on it can present differently.  Not everyone has every symptom. There is a document under the RSD organization website that has a list of doctors by area. I found my doctor there and he has been fantastic. Try a new doctor who will listen to you and work together *with* you.

3) There really is hope. My life looks different than it did, but I have learned how to pace myself and my abilities are increasing in time. I suggest talking to a pain psychologist who can help you cope, it was (and is) a life saver for me.

&gt; I believe depression is legitimate. But I also believe if you don't exercise, eat nutritious foods, get sunlight, get enough sleep, consume positive material, and surround yourself with support, you aren't giving yourself a fighting chance.

Someone's reply was this, and I couldn't agree more:

&gt; Pushing these kinds of insipid platitudes isn't ""helping"", it's just engaging in a popular redundancy others can agree to, so people appear to have done something... without actually doing anything significant. You're not saying anything special, you just want to hear yourself sound ""wise"" at the expense of easy prey.

Believing depression is ""legitimate"" doesn't come with throwing down a gauntlet for depressed people, especially when they are not motivated to do the things on the list. That's why it's depression and not just being sad.

As magpiegoo said, it's OK to acknowledge a struggle, and to lift people up who are having a hard time.

* **Lack of truly accessible spots** 1 in 5 Americans are disabled, yes not all likely need accessible parking but I would bet money it is a good percentage of those people.
* **Accessible spots that are too far from the door**, I get that the ramp is way the fuck down there but I have my placard because I can't walk way the fuck down there - move the ramp and the spot!
* **Abuse**. This ranges from people not having proper plates or placards to people using their child's or partner's placard--or worst of al--in states where placards don't expire people use or sell placards from their dead grandparents. These ""unexpiring"" placards congest an already failing system.
* People that think it's okay to use any part of an accessible spot as a loading zone.

Finally, I don't care if you're only going to be five minutes. Without a plate or placard you have as much right to park in that spot as I have to borrow your car while you run in and run out of the store.

As for the carts--I am guilty and I apologize. That said I don't willy-nilly throw my cart there, I specifically leave it well out of the way of any possible parking or door or lift/ramp use.

ace75150-4e2a-47e5-ab13-530ecb106c47,1560974797,"Adults often hesitate to bring up the subject of a terminal diagnosis with children, for fear that such a discussion will frighten or even traumatize them. The truth be known, children are aware of both death and serious illness whether or not they have experienced it in their immediate family. They know about it from Fairy Tails, television shows including nature shows oh, the death of a pet, and so on. And while their parents may not realize it, children are aware of many things, including terminal illness, through their classrooms.
The ways in which children respond to a terminal diagnosis is shaped in large part by their social environment. Most prominent in this regard our parents, teachers, and family. Children are very sensitive to the emotional moods and nonverbal Communications of adults around them, and they sense when a parent or other relative is upset even if these adults think that they are unaware of what may be happening. Given that reality, it makes sense to us to open communication rather than avoiding it.
Obviously the level and type of discussion you have with a child about a terminal diagnosis will depend in part on the child's developmental stage and the nature of the specific diagnosis. Of course some terminal patients die quickly. Increasingly, however, we can expect children to be confronted with a parent, friend, or other loved one who battles cancer for years, who may experience a prolonged remission, and who may or may not experience a recurrence.
All records and research shows that it is helpful for families to talk about death and dying as a normal part of the life process, beginning when children are young, in order to help them clarify their concepts of the life death process. Tell them what they need to know. Explanations of a terminal diagnosis and what it means do you need to change depending on the child's developmental stage. Regardless of age, however, allowing for a child's questions, and encouraging the child to express feelings, can go a long way toward providing reassurance and establishing a supportive relationship. It's also okay to answer a question with I don't know if that is the truth. For younger children in particular it's important to explain how treatment may affect the patient, along with how their own routines may change. For example it's important to explain that chemotherapy may cause temporary fatigue or nausea as well as loss of hair. When mother told her young son and daughter the following: ""daddy will be taking me for treatment once a week and afterwards I will be sleepy and need to rest but the next day I will feel better. And Susan will come over to help out on those nights, and daddy will be getting your favorite takeout food on his way home from work. Also, I will lose my hair, but that will grow back after I am better, and in the meantime I will have to wear a wig.""
When a child is dying, the hardest talk is worth having. In fact, the failure to discuss death with children who are old enough to understand the concept and who wish to have the conversation can make it harder for all involved. Conversation could help children who are brooding silently suffer less as they approach death. It would also ensure parents know more about the children's final wishes. If this is the case, I highly recommend you check out the website theconversationproject.org.",,,3,0,0,

It would really help to know what you are on, what you are doing to make this money by what means.  Different programs have different rules.

The research is also slow but there is research happening that could lead to better treatments. I personally just try and remind myself that there may not be any treatments now but there could be multiple on the horizon. Another thing that helps me is just making my immediate surroundings as functional and comforting as possible. I also make my health and comfort a priority. I’ve found getting upset at how awful things are just makes me feel crappy about feeling crappy So I try to be nauseatingly positive.

Whenever I have to be ~fancy~ or I know that I’m only going to be out for a very short time and walking minimal distances, I may use a cane. I was prescribed a power wheelchair at the age of 16 because of the sheer severity of my joint issues. I’m now 17, nearly 18. Here are my thoughts:

I really would’ve rather had a manual chair, but my doctors insisted on a power chair because of the fact that my shoulders simply do not stay in socket—gravity alone can and will dislocate them, so pushing myself in a wheelchair was unlikely. 

I got the power chair off of Facebook for $300, great condition. Check Facebook first, if you’re comfortable...   thrift stores may not be bad for finding a manual chair either, but I’d definitely recommend getting fitted for one. 

Second of all, my power chair is easily 200 pounds. In other words, it can’t be transported. My battery completely failed this April, so now I’m stuck without a wheelchair. I’m definitely getting a new battery and I’m going to try and get a manual chair at a thrift store before college.

The people I work with are intelligent, funny, kind- they run the gamut of wonderful qualities - and also some unpleasant ones! - They are such normal people, except that they share the amazing fact that have a hard time communicating. 
Because of their disabilities, it can be very challenging for many of them to fully and explicitly express their opinions on abstract subjects like ""identity"".  I would love to know what my clients feel about their disability status; how it makes them feel in the world. I'd love to be able to provide support for them, wherever they are in the process of identifying with their disability. But because of the very nature of their impairment, I'm often unable to know the nuances of what they feel.

So I really appreciate hearing from people who can express themselves. It gives me more perspectives on what some of the people I work with may be going through.

I grew up in a strict Christian household. I’ve definitely done my fair share of wrestling with those beliefs. But I don’t believe God will strike you down for not believing. In fact, Jesus explicitly says it’s better to be hot or cold, rather than lukewarm. This means it’s ok to not be in some sort of vague middle ground, although it’s fine to be in a place of discovery. But the God I believe in is no longer implementing the Old Testament “strike you down and poof you’re dead” because Jesus came to change that. Jesus came to put an end to the old law and makes it easy to be freed from all that. 

I know I’m not saying it perfectly but that’s what I understand to be true. God is not going to punish you for not believing in him. Give yourself freedom to explore what you want to believe. Maybe that will be the Christian God, but maybe not. Let it be your choice. Free yourself from that specific fear. It’s really hard to do that when everyone around you is saying otherwise, but I promise it’s ok to ask questions. We are made to be smart and not take everything at face value. 

I recommend the channel “God Is Gray” on YouTube.

&gt;EXR is a safety net for people who successfully return to work and lose their entitlement to Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits and payments. **If your cash payments ended because of your work and earnings, and you stop work within five years of when your benefits ended, you may be able to have your benefits started again right away through a request for EXR.**",,,1,0,0,
b6a13fef-aaa1-46ab-929f-f298a524c120,1560386361,"exactly correct. I don't know all of the answers, but I'd say that the entire safety net needs to be redesigned to encourage people to get off of it (perhaps, but not necessarily, including SSDI); maybe a person gets greater benefits for working, than for not? but maybe not. Certainly, having an hard 'cut off' line is absurd. ""get a small pay increase, but lose hundreds of dollars worth of benefits,"" is a dangerous incentive to work less, work less hard, and not seek out progression in any work environment. 

It should absolutely be a gradual cutoff. Maybe it's still an hard line for being accepted, but once a person's on the social program, gradual decline in benefits for increased earnings is the only intelligent way to go, at least which I've heard of.

I had heard from one social worker, but I've never seen nor heard anything else about it, that a person can be on ""partial SSDI"" - where their medical is covered, but their wages are not. That was back when I could still work, but my medical expenses were ramping up, and beginning to be a real strain on the family (we've kind of just accepted major debt as a way of life, for now.... which isn't any good, but it's that or... you know.... die.) 

Anyway, I like that kind of idea: and SSDI program which actually can be modified for each person's needs, maybe ""up to"" a certain point... but.... we should never have to worry about fully losing benefit because we accidentally worked more than we're allowed to. at worst, it should be like... ""you earned 60$ more than you're supposed to, so we're going to send you 60$ less this month"". I think it should actually be different than that, but no *worse* than that.",,,2,0,0,

b92b76fb-6d68-449f-8dae-33872eab7598,1561709988,"I fell ill at the end of my first year of college.  Because of the rarity of my disease, it took 3-years to finally reach a diagnosis.  I understand wholeheartedly just how hard a process applying for Social Security can be.  Here are my recommendations.....

&amp;#x200B;

Right off the bat, expect to be denied.  When that happens, appeal the decision.  Do not reapply.  If you reapply, your application date changes, which will directly affect your backpay once awarded.

&amp;#x200B;

Do not get a lawyer to assist you with the process, unless it comes down to a State Hearing, at which point it can be useful.  If you can do it by yourself, do it by yourself.  Any lawyer will take a large percentage of your backpay.  When I received my backpay, it all went to bills that had been piling up for years due to my inability to maintain gainful employment.

&amp;#x200B;

You cannot submit too much information.  The more, the better.  Diagnostics are the key.  X-rays, bloodwork, urinalysis.  Any test that has been done that lends useful information, no matter how small, is what you need.  You can also ask people who have seen your health deteriorate to write testimonials.  Just be sure that you're submitting honest and truthful testimonials from people that know you and your health issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I don't know how old your parents are, but if they are both of retirement age, it may be worth looking into the Disabled Adult Child (DAC) program.  Basically, if you were disabled before age 22 and have been unable to reach the necessary credits for full Social Security benefits, you can use a parent's work history as your own.  Doing so will not affect your parents' benefits whatsoever.  The fact you're married may keep you from being eligible for this program though, though it's still worth looking into if it means a higher monthly check.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of all, stay strong.  It took me a long 2-years to finally obtain my SS benefits, and the stress of it all destroyed the relationship I was in.  Good luck!",,,2,0,0,

You get to board aeroplanes first! Although you also have to disembark last. Have a nap and know it's impossible to forget your stuff when your row is empty. 

Funky lights and decorations are funky.

My rabbit can jump onto my lap the second I come home at night. Con: My rabbit always wants to jump onto my lap the second I come home at night. 

Hidden pockets on wheelchairs. People are amazed when I whip a shopping bag out of 'nowhere'. 

My best friends are all very short. I am not. If I could walk, it would be much harder to talk to them while walking along! 

Shoes last forever, Converse stay clean and you can wear ridiculous high heels that able bodied people can't stand up in.

My sister was stuck with a conversion disorder label until she found a doctor who diagnosed her with Ehrlos Danlos Syndrom (collagen disorder that usually has loose joints that subluxate and disconnect along with a bunch of other symptoms) Hers is a \*relatively\* mild case (not mild compared to 'normal"" people) and docs that did know of it only expected the most extreme cases. I've also heard of people with rare nerve disorders having problems getting diagnosed. (One youtuber I watch has a disorder that renders her temporarily paralyzed - most of it (she has some perm. damage) usually comes back but it creates a lot of questions because it is relatively transient. When she was a teen she lost use of her arms and hands -  she is still partially paralyzed in her hands. Posterioral Orthostatic (I think Tachicardia) Syndrom (POTS) another disorder that is often misdiagnosed as psychiatric. Fibromylagia \*still\* has trouble being taken seriously.   


Basically, if the majority of patients are women we are dismissed. There have been studies that show this discrepancy.  There are anecdotes in TwoX Reddit that show this behavior on the part of doctors and the public.   
My wife has something going on that we cannot pinpoint. Doctors want to label her with a specific kind of conversion disorder. One of very few psychological experts in that disorder  has said she does \*no\* fit the criteria. So we are on the same journey and struggling. Luckily my wife's GP believes there is \*something\* neurological going on that we cannot figure out  yet.  


Please keep pushing. That being said, people should not be such jerks about psychiatric disorders. I hate to say it but I've experienced that nonsense by other disabled peeps (I have bipolar as one of my diagnosis). People need to stop thinking that they have experienced psychological disorders when they've been sad or nervous - not depressed or anxious in the psychological sense. They need to stop thinking that any disability is contagious &gt;:(",,,7,0,0,

7716495d-928e-4a54-9274-1028888036f6,1561203612,"Keep in mind as well there's casual dating and then there's the serious shit. And in a lot of places, disability supports make the serious shit a bitch and a half. where I'm living, for example.

My only problem is I can't see my own hand in front of my face. But, if I quit this job and don't have something else lined up (I'm not, but play hypothetical for a second), that means all I'll have is disability income. If I meet an able-bodied person, we hit it off, decide hey let's give it a shot, and say we get to the point where we start talking about moving in. That conversation will go cold quick, fast and in a hurry, for one major reason. The second I start living with a partner who's working, disability supports take a walk. Now, in my case I have no medication or anything, but if I had, I'd have still kept as much of the coverage for that as I'd be used to having, but I'd have 0 income of my own. I would be entirely dependent, not physically but financially, on my partner. Because I'm working I'm not completely reliant on disability payments, so if the little I got took a walk I'd be fine--particularly considering moving in with someone would mean I'd keep more of my paycheck. But someone else who's not in my position would be screwed.

Now, let's look at that from the other side. I make $16/hour. In some places that's a nice chunk of change. This is not one of those places. I can afford to support me on $16/hour (I have no savings, but I make ends meet), but no way in hell could I afford to support two. No matter how much I loved someone, I couldn't afford that someone to live with me on what I make right now. If that someone isn't capable of working, it would suck, but moving them in anyway would be probably the most impractical thing I could do--for both of us.

My current GF and I have actually had that conversation--she's not in a wheelchair all the time, but there are days when she is. I'd have moved her in already, but at the moment she's not working and on disability. so on the one hand, moving her in would make her more independent--she'd have me there to lend an extra hand on days she needs it, but on the other hand, it would cost her the independence she already has. I don't want my partner to have to ask me for permission to go for coffee with a friend. And if you have to ask me to throw you $10 so you can go for coffee, you're basically asking me for permission. That's not cool, and way too freaking easy to abuse like mad.

Now, to more directly address your question, only about 6 years later, I don't know what kind of challenges you face on the daily basis. I can't--I'm not you. Presumedly (you can correct me if I'm wrong, of course) you've got some kind of home care service that comes in to help, or you're still living with parents, or somesuch. If you go the dating someone else in a wheelchair route, she'll probably be in exactly the same situation--either she's got some kind of home care service, or she's living with someone that helps with stuff like that. If it became more serious than casual dating, you'd have to work around those questions. The trick, like dating an able-bodied person, is to find the workaround that actually works for both of you and doesn't leave either one of you getting the short stick. Maybe, like my GF and I, moving in doesn't become an option until much further down the road, when you've figured out how to answer the sticky questions--like ""Can we find a service or something that will get us both out of bed?"". Maybe moving in doesn't happen at all. If that's what you're comfortable with, and if you can manage the risks, then I'd say maybe don't explicitly rule out dating someone in a wheelchair. You may not know if you can until you've met the right person, if you meet the right person. But also keep in mind, that woman in a wheelchair you swiped left on? 10 gets you 20 the same thought went through her head at least once. So at the very least, you know that if it gets to a point where you need to have that conversation it won't necessarily be as awkward a conversation as it would be if you were having it with someone else. Sure, it might not work out. But if you never try, you guarantee it won't work out. It's up to you if you're okay with that.

TL; DR: Dating is a pain in the ass if you're disabled, whether or not your date is. Pick your challenges.",,,1,0,0,

I am not autistic and my specific disabilities are not part of my identity, though other things are (gay, transgender).

But that's fine. I *am* a disabled person, because that informs how people immediately react to me. Whether it *should* doesn't matter. Me labeling myself as disabled means I am not ashamed of identifying myself, of reclaiming that word. It's political because abled people have power and privilege over disabled people.

Context also matters. If you're at a coffee shop with a friend and you happen to run into Bob, who you know has autism, you wouldn't introduce him like ""this is my autistic friend Bob"" or ""Bob is a person with autism"" because it's extremely unlikely to be relevant to a quick conversation.

b6a13fef-aaa1-46ab-929f-f298a524c120,1560383731,"one of the things which bugs me is the 'either on or off' attitude to ssdi.

What I mean is that the setup, as it stands, is designed to ensure that those who are disabled (if they can get onto the insurance program to begin with, which I'm still working on.... it's *only* been... 5 years since I could work? Something like that....), it's designed to ensure that the disabled can never *leave* the program.

Many people could work, being disabled, but not sufficiently to earn a living. There is a token allowance for this in the system, but it's a hard line: make more than *x*, and you're off.

Many people could work, maybe even enough to earn a living, but couldn't afford medical bills without being a part of the system. So it's better to stay entirely impoverished with medical coverage (which is financially crippling, even with medicare...), then to be destitute because of it.

The entirety of our social welfare system works in the same manner. 

Did you get a pay raise of 200$ as month? Great! Good for you! Even though your take home is only 150 (after taxes), you're now going to get cut off from your $300/month worth of food stamps. That's what you get for working hard for that promotion. 

You're working now? Good for you! No more medicaid, even if your job is just a part-time, minimum wage job. Clearly you're doing well enough to cover your medical expenses.

It just ticks me off. One of the most important long-term care things for a person with disabilities is to give up as little autonomy as possible. Our system is designed in a way to incentivize people on the social safety net to *stay* on it - long term. It's not just that there's no incentive to move on from it, the system *discourages* people from doing just a little better, from growing and developing their skills. 

And worse, the more people there are living on the system, the more bogged down and short-funded it is for those who *must* rely on the system, long term. And for those of us who are disabled, but want to work the couple of hours a week that we can (in my case, there's no rhyme or reason to those hours, if I get them at all.... so.... that sucks), it's better for us to *not*, because we risk being screwed at our next ssdi evaluation. 

The poverty among the disabled is part and partial to our system, no doubt. If we have to spend a great portion of our funds on medical care and living adjustments (a wheelchair accessable car, for example, is a bloody fortune), then there's not a lot left over for living. The further we are from public access to all the things, the harder that's going to be... though.... living away from the city has advantages too (like lower housing costs, more sociable neighbors, etc.... 

Still, the more we incentivize the system to discourage working, even if it's only a little, the more isolated and impoverished we remain. 

But there's no political will to alter the system... and insofar as the will exists, there's hardly a consensus on *what* to do about it (I've got almost no expectation that I would agree with most here, for example).",,,7,0,0,

I feel trapped, The energy I spend on cheap bus travel takes away from energy I could use to work more hours, the energy I save by ubering means I could work more, but the wages I make don't cover the cost of ubering to work all the time. I don't qualify for travel reimbursement from welfare/disability because I'm ""not working hard enough"". But reimbursing my travel would allow me to work harder!

------------------------

I'm not on a true disability pension, I'm in Australia and for those who understand our system i'm on Newstart with a 15 hour benchmark, meaning after being medically assessed by the welfare office they have determined that my disability limits me to 15 hours per week of work, a decision that I agree with, I can ""work"" 15 hours a week and this is a good balance of challenging myself without pushing myself into flare ups or utter exhaustion.

I had a job that was 15-18 hours per week, It was consultant work so my travel was 100% covered by the company, they'd order me a taxi for door-door service. So I know I can work 15 hours a week. That role only ran for a year, and afterwards I was between jobs for about 1 month, during that time the welfare agency gave me taxi-vouchers for ""Job interviews"", ""Job readiness"" and ""health maintenance"" meaning if I needed to go to the doctors, or go to the shops to buy interview clothes or go to the library to print off resumes, or go to an interview, the transport was direct (door to door via taxi) and 100% paid for by welfare. This is not ""special treatment"" many people without disabilities who are on Newstart qualify for petrol vouchers or bus fare, it's means based.

I now work as a community support officer/adult education teachers aide, my employer is very understanding and accommodating and does what they can to help, but it's a non-profit and there's only so much they can do. I work 3 days a week, just over 2 hours per day, helping to run various social programs for the community.

The problem I'm having is travel. I live only ~6km from the community centre so It's very local work. But there is no bus that goes directly there, I have to walk 1km to the bus stop closest to my house, then take a 20 minute bus, then transfer to a 15 minute train, then another 40 minute bus (this bus stop is fortunately right out front of my work). With the way the transit timetable works, when i'm including wait times at the station/stop for my connecting service this is a 90 minute commute one way - Assuming everything is running on time, last month it took me 4 hours to get home due to trains not stopping at the station and buses not stopping when I flagged them (It's a common issue in Melbourne) So I'm spending 3 hours commuting to my 2 hour job. that's 15 hours a week of doing something related to either getting to work or being at work.... 15 hours is what the welfare office agrees I can do in regards to work.

It's exhausting. I do not have the energy to spend 3 hours sitting on uncomfortable buses, waiting on uncomfortable metal chairs at bus stops, or walking 2km each day.

I am at my limit with my 6-8 hours work because the commute takes up the energy I could otherwise dedicate to working longer shifts.  Because as I am not hitting my paid work benchmark, I do not qualify for any mobility assistance, taxi-vouchers etc.

I am finding myself forced to take an uber at least one way, so I can arrive at work fresh and full of energy, then I will take the bus home to save money, and crash when I get home, with little energy and pain tolerance available to prepare food, clean my house or shower, I am managing at the moment, but barely.

Some days I over-do it at work, I don't have the ability to get home via bus, I have to order an uber home. I'm paid minimum wage for my award group. This means that if I uber both ways 50-60% of my daily income from paid work goes directly to my travel expenses (regular daily commute is not tax-deductible).

My income from work is basically pocket money, while my rent is paid entirely by my Newstart allowance (and it's over 50% of my allowance too!) When my welfare case manager asks why I'm not pushing for my 15 hour benchmark and I'm finding myself at my limits at 6-8, I have to remind them that I am doing up to 9 hours of travel on top of my 6-8 hours work, and for someone with a disability, commuting is just as exhausting as working, in fact, my commute is *harder* on my body than my paid work.

If I could uber to and from work all the time I think I would be able to increase my hours to 15, But right now I'm stuck, I don't have the energy on hand to increase my hours to increase my income to be able to afford to uber both ways, and right now I don't have the income to uber both ways to better allocate my energy so I can increase my hours.

When my case manager says ""well just work 4 hours a day instead of 2, You're getting 2x the income and you're still only having to pay uber 6 times a week the same fare you currently do"" .... I understand the maths, But am I just supposed to pull the energy needed for those 2 additional hours of work out of my ass? I don't have that right now.

Also, There isn't 4 hours of work *to do* at my current job, the programs I help run go for 90 minutes, we run 1 program a day, Set up and pack up time only takes 30-45 minutes, an hour tops. After that everyone goes home. I could sign up to run programs on the 2 days I am currently not working (so doing 5 programs a week instead of 3) but that means travelling to/from work an additional 4 times a week, which does not solve my ""I'm  doing too much travel"" problem. Getting a second job could work, but again, i'd be travelling to a whole new jobsite, and the mental exhaustion that would come from working for two different employers, managing my time between the two, learning a whole new system, etc, I don't have the energy for that in my current situation.",,,7,0,0,

ba452430-62ce-46dc-9207-a13ecd0ba570,1561190091,"Cast of characters, Me (Rach), my sister in law (sil), Sister in law's Mom (Abbie), Karen-(lipsense, hairspray, chunky highlights that scream ” my hairdresser is 50+”, and a humility problem). 

So, every year four of the kids in our family participate in a Bible knowledge competition, and the national championship is this huge event where thousands of dollars worth of prizes and scholarships are given out, and there is this amazing community vibe. My brother and his wife run a small business, and they have four kids, don't use sitters or nannies, and this event is enormous. Since I don't work and I have no kids, I go to help out, keep the kids entertained, and I get to travel ”on my own” without my husband but also not be completely helpless if something happens. 

The event is amazing, and the people who attend the event are helpful, wholesome, nobody swears, nobody hits on married women, nobody jumps on the elevator before the disabled person waiting (like carnival cruisers do all the damn time), nothing gets stolen, and it's just a really great vibe. I've never had to ask for help, it's offered in droves, and I really love going. 

It's normally held in an event center/resort. Last year, that changed. They changed the location to a megachurch, and for whatever reason the city fire Marshall had checked the night before and had been concerned about strollers. That's fine, that's normal. 

What wasn't normal, and what is really, really soul-crushing, is that in the design of most church buildings, disabled people are an afterthought. I could look the other way if this was ”ye olde clapboard church of legalism,” or a place that was built in a metal barn and then converted, but, it wasn't. It was a multi-floor, multi acre building, with new finishes, elevators, and you could easily fit 10,000 people in the building at any given time. What wheelchair seats were available were at the back of the room, and not elevated so as to be able to see when the people in front of you stand, which is like half of a church service. 

And in those back spaces, was camera equipment, lighting, rigging, and producer booths. I would have had to sit in the back row of the second floor. So, like I have at every one of these before, I sat in the aisle next to my family and the kids. 

Karen worked for the organization, and approaches . She squats next to me, grabs the arm of my chair to balance (which is a HUGE pet peeve of mine), and said, ”We can't have anything in the aisle, it's a fire hazard.” I said, ”Oh ok, I won't set anything down.” 

K-”No, you need to move. We can't have strollers or anything blocking the aisle.” 

”I am not something, I'm someone, if there's a fire I'm obviously going to head to the fire exit like  a normal human person.”

K-""No, no, we can't have anyone in the aisle.”

” You're in the aisle right now.” 

K- “But I- ”(at this point she stopped herself from saying something that would get her decked if I weren't a lady.) ” It's not my decision, it's up to the Fire Marshall.”

” Great, can you please inform him a wheelchair is not a stroller? I'd love to have grounds for a discrimination suit. Where is he?”

K ""No he was here last night. If he comes back he'll write a ticket.”

” Sounds great, send him straight to me, I'm happy to take this to court.” 

Now, if this were a small space, I might have seen the point, but you could have fit two more wheelchairs chairs across the aisle. I wasn't in the way at all. I asked behind me if I was blocking line of sight, I had intentionally sat in a wider, exterior aisle.

K- ” We can help you into a seat and put your wheelchair back with the strollers.”

” well what if there's a fire? What then?”

K-” We just really need to move you,”

” I can be anywhere a person with legs can be, legally.  For the last time, I'm good here. Thanks.”

”Ok well I'll have to let the director know!” 

To which I gave the southern woman reply of ”Well I look forward to hearing from him.” which is as close to ""Get Bent” as I will say in a house of God in front of children. 

Nobody staff wise said a word to me after that for the rest of the night, but not only had she made me mad, she'd made my SIL mad, which set off a hilarious chain reaction of her Mom (Abbie) getting mad, and between the three of us, it was over for Karen.

 My sister in law and I are two peas in a pod. We get asked if we're sisters, same height, same eye color, and some of her kids favor me looks wise, but no, no incest here. But we both have these personalities that are light and relaxed and easygoing, until we're really, really not, and our extended family has been through the wringer, so we are very, very protective of one another. 

Now, unbeknownst to me, Karen had pulled similar antics the year before. Because of their field of work and the horror stories they've seen, my Bro &amp; Sil have very, very specific and inflexible rules. Their kids are never, ever behind closed doors with adults not on ”the list,” of blood related and extremely trusted people, and the kids are not allowed in rooms with closed doors unless they're the only one in the room. (No more than one kid in the bathroom at a time, etc.) I guess you deal with enough CPS court cases, and you realize not everyone can be trusted. So, there's a part in competition where the kids answer a judge's questions, one kid, multiple adults, no spectators allowed. So my SIL says she needs to be able to see in a window, but she's not allowed to hear. So she had obtained permission, etc. Well, Karen tried to stop her, SIL is unwavering. Karen turns and loudly starts badmouthing these ”Overprotective” blah blah blah, background checks.... And then after my niece left and came to sit with her dad, SIL ripped Karen a new one. Told her about what they do for work, how background checks don't mean s*, etc. 

So SIL remembers Karen pulled that the year before, and now she's picking on me, and SIL is so beyond angry it's nuts. So she tells her mom about the year before, and what she said to me, and so Abbie pulls Karen aside at the end of the night, and specifically asks to talk to her and the director. Abbie is the nicest lady you'll ever meet, sometimes to a fault. 

I'm paraphrasing, but basically Abbie says with the director listening, ”Ya know, Karen, you've just really upset Rach, she is a cancer survivor, she spends all of her time either helping her community or fighting her illnesses. She makes a huge effort to be here and you were really unkind. She has a right to be where she is comfortable. Now last year, Karen, you were really ugly to my daughter. I have known Rach for 20 years and I have never heard her do or say anything hurtful or spiteful. So now last year we had a problem and this year, we have a problem, and we come here for fellowship and to encourage these kids to know their Bible, so let's bear that in mind.”

Karen objects, ”I don't remember being rude to your daughter,” 

And Abbie says, ” I'm sure you don't, because you do this all of the time, so it's not a memorable thing to you.”

Mic. Dropped. 

So, the next day was a day that's usually really long, and being that I tire easily, I didn't attend the full day so I would be well enough to travel, go to the wrap event, etc on the last couple of day. 

My Brother is a Lawyer, his Stepfather in law is a lawyer, and his brother in law is a lawyer. So they all look at case law, Abbie is pulling up information, and I find an interesting article about fire history, and never in the history of the world has a person in a wheelchair been a factor in a fire related death or injury of another person.

An email about the incident is sent, and what do you know, I get an apology, and a call that there's an area that is *already blocked with a boom camera* and they've reserved the seats there to accommodate us.

I don't know if I'll go back this year, I know the kids are doing more school and one had a minor health issue, and is leveling into a harder age division, so who knows what will happen this year, but the thing that really, really bugs me about it is that in a place that has felt like a home among strangers, there's a Karen trying to pull a power move on a disabled woman because she lacked the empathy and rational thought to differentiate between a stroller and a person. .",,,3,0,0,

65cd786b-2cb4-4e65-b4dc-934bc5caf43f,1560996488,"I have not done an ALJ hearing, but here's my advice.

[You have a right to representation.](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10075.pdf) I would recommend a disability lawyer if you're going to face a judge. A disability lawyer works on contingency based on your potential back-pay, and doesn't require any cash up-front. It is highly in your interest to hire one. Defending yourself in any situation is not advised, because the balance of power is strongly in the judge's favor.

My disability is also psychological, bipolar disorder. I got approved in a relatively short time in the second application. The things that helped me were a long medical history and a spotty work history after a steady career.

Therapist visits, psychiatrist visits, and hospital stays can help establish the medical part of your disability. Every medical provider has to make a diagnosis and treatment plan, and the more providers that concur on your diagnosis and disability, the better. If you haven't been getting psychological help due to financial hardship, your lawyer can help you prove that.

Unsuccessful Work Attempts (UWAs) help establish your disability's impact on your inability to work. UWAs are jobs that are six months or less, and your disability is the reason you left the job. It helps to have multiple UWAs, and also to have tried multiple levels of work, such as easier or lighter-duty jobs. If you don't have many UWAs, or haven't worked in a long time, a lawyer can help explain your situation to the judge.

-Be a translator. If you aren't already bilingual, learning a language can be relatively inexpensive. 
-Be a person who records audiobooks. 
-Participate in scientific studies. Most studies provide monetary compensation, and furthering research can benefit a large portion of the disabled community. 
-Be a tutor. Websites like Wyzant allow you to tutor people in your area and people online all over the world (or at least US). There's a wide range of postings, like people wanting help with ACT prep or learning how to use basic functions on a computer.

In that time I've been through 5 rheumatologist and 3 pcp, so make sure you accurately list all the drs you've been to. Don't hesitate to list any dr, even if you don't think they have anything to do with your primary condition. 

It took 3 months - and luckily no appeal, for me to get approved. Because I was so young (32) I started working with a lawyer from the beginning. It shocked everyone that it came through so quickly. They did have me examined by their doctor and I had about 15 years of tests, medications tried and failed, and job histories of excessive FMLA use. At the time I applied my SED rate was in the 90s, and my dr was seriously freaking out. 

I'm coming up on 2 years in September, so I'm sure I will be called in for a review sooner rather than later. 

Advice would be to not hold back with legitimate complaints. Don't put on a brave face with the doctor by trying to minimize the pain and other symptoms. There are also some apps out there to document symptoms so you can share them, but if they aren't in your medical records, they aren't documented. Contact some local disability lawyers, they are capped on what they can charge, and operate on contingency so they can tell you if you are likely to win.

Yes, it's possible they are wrong and you can get an second opinion.

More importantly, these diagnoses are just that, diagnoses. They do not define you and are only one way of measuring potential for academic success, not your actual success.

If you are planning to attend college, do it. Make sure to connect with the Disability Services office at the college you choose to attend and ask for accommodations. (Source: this is what I do for a living). 

I have accommodated students with any mixture of those disabilities, and with much lower IQ scores and they have graduated. Make sure to ask about accommodations when visiting colleges to find out what support is available.

Did you receive a written report with your scores? Those often give a much better picture of overall function than scores alone. They tend to explain specific strengths and weaknesses as well as the margin of error for the tests (how likely they are to be accurate). If you did not receive a written report, ask for one.

If you are in the United States, find your state's vocational rehabilitation agency and apply for services. In New York this is ACCES-VR. They can do additional testing, help with tuition or book expenses, and provide additional support services. 

Most importantly, a test does not define you or your potential. Good luck and make sure to update us when you do open that business!",,,9,0,0,

If you haven't you need to understand that it takes two years after SSD begins that MC kicks in (I wasn't eligible for Medicaid so I don't know if you can get that in the meantime), however, once MC kicks in, you need to get a supplement policy to cover what MC doesn't and the  prescription plan D. With those three, other than co-pays on meds (and no dental, vision other than medical vision problems, dentures are covered by MC) all of my medical bills are completely covered. I get a Remicade IV every 6 weeks that run thousands of dollars per IV (total charged $11,000/each!), MC pays its part my AARP supplemental policy pays the rest - I never pay a nickel of the cost. So while some think they don't need the policies, I can't afford to not pay that $200/month to AARP, they pay out every 6 weeks $1127! Yes, my biggest expense is my insurances because I am married and my husband has been working up to recently when his health just won't let him anymore. My in-laws get their insurance paid for through Medicaid and they don't pay nearly what I do. I guess what I am saying is once on MC your medical bills, assuming you pick the right insurance providers and supplement, can most likely trickle down to nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

As to being too poor to buy coverage, you will have part of the cost of MC taken directly from your SSD check monthly. SSD is set up to understand the needs of someone that is disabled and should be able to answer your questions. Trying to hire a manager to be sure that your medical expenses are covered, I think is a very expensive way to deal with finances unless you are making so much that even declared disabled, you are making more than SSD will allow for benefits. Many people are completely disabled and make more money than many of us, and still, work regular 40/hour week jobs, etc. and do not get SS checks because they make too much. I still think it sounds whether you think so or not that you are trying to make an end-run around the SSD and Medicaid and Medicare rules as well as IRS. Especially since on top of this person paying your medical expenses, their cost will also be taken out of the business for what they do and would make your business look as if you are making far less than you really are. Someone making say,  $1000 off the internet should not have to pay someone to handle the money for them. Earn much more than that and SS will really be taking a close look at what you are doing. They aren't stupid.",,,2,0,0,

My tech gets funded through the Arc of Northern Virginia, but there are different branches in most states. I think there’s a $5,000 assistive technology budget per year, and if you prove the necessity of a certain item, it’ll be funded. So, you couldn’t just get a new iPad because you want one. You have to go through an assistive tech evaluation. In my case, my first and original iPad—which was also funded through the Arc—was six years old and running iOS 9.3.5.

Look up a psychologist or a psychiatrist who has experience diagnosing and treating conversion disorder. Even if you do have it, you’ll need psychology to aid you in getting over it.  And if you don’t, having a psychologist vouch for that is very important, because you don’t want symptoms written off as psychological when it’s turns out they’re not.  Even stress and anxiety can provoke real symptoms as changes in adrenaline &amp; cortisol have affects on your body.

Regardless, please go see a mental health professional qualified to give a diagnosis, so that if you *do* have conversion disorder they can treat you, and if you *don’t* have conversion disorder they can inform your doctors that your symptoms are physiologically based.  Women especially are mislabeled with conversation disorder at a statistically unsound rate.

Suddenly they are reading the results of a doctor's evaluation that I had never seen, who practices in a city I haven't lived in since I was a baby (I was in my late 40s at this point) and the city was a good 8 hours away. According to this doctor who had NEVER seen me and which apparently the judge based her decision on, I could crawl, kneel, etc. At that point I had two artificial knees and kneeling on them is horrifically painful.  I can't knee, nor can I crawl, and if I fall it takes hubby and me usually 15-20 minutes to get me back up on my feet! Is this someone that can crawl? How can these decisions be made by doctors who have never seen us? It took a whole additional year to be approved for SSD which meant I had no Medicare coverage, no money coming in, etc. Because I was an RN as well as a college graduate, they saw no reason to help me train me for a different career that would fit in with my abilities as well as my disabilities, especially the need for a several hour nap every afternoon. Can you imagine telling a boss daily, I have to go take my nap now? 

&amp;#x200B;

Granted many of you go through far worse than I do, but to be told that I am not disabled because I could do a job that is not available anywhere in our county nor could I drive to it if there were such a job - watching packages go by  on a CCTV at a UPS sorting center! It doesn't matter if there isn't a job within 1000 miles that will accommodate you if you can do it you aren't disabled. I'd like to see that judge when she comes to the point of being disabled herself.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the problem is the people that set these laws and enforce them have no imagination, compassion, or understanding what each person's needs are. One hospital where I worked 2nd shift,  we had a 1st shift employee that was in a motorized w/c. If she would go out at night but then had to use the bathroom, would have to get in her conversion van, drive to the hospital, come find me so I could help her get onto the toilet, wipe her up and get her back into the w/c and back she would go back to her night out. Apparently, she didn't ask for help from her friends. The same situation that the poster has said. It isn't all about them being taken advantage of, but most would have no idea the proper method of moving someone in and out of a w/c.",,,5,0,0,

Take a look at question three.  There may be laws in your city or state, which protect the rights of those w/ emotional support animals.  Make certain that you aren't infringing against those, if they exist.  

As to your question regarding what types of answers you can expect, you should be prepared for any number of responses.  [Here's](https://www.psychdogpartners.org/resources/work-tasks/work-task-list) a fairly comprehensive list of assigned tasks service animals may be trained to do.  There's also a PDF print-out available on that site.  And, [here](https://www.iaadp.org/psd_tasks.html) is a document pertaining to tasks fulfilled by psychiatric service animals.  Be certain to note the legal distinction between an emotional support animal and a psychiatric service animal.  While some of the tasks psychiatric service animals may be assisting w/ would seemingly fall under an emotional support category, they are still considered every bit a legal service animal.

One other item of note, just so it's stated, b/c it's not something people often think about, but service animals are there in a working capacity.  This means that they aren't to be disturbed, played w/, fed, etc. w/out the handler's permission.  Many people are fine w/ others attending to their animal or playing w/ them, but others are not, and they have a legal right to prevent others from interfering w/ the duties of their service animal.  While I realize that you are unable to control the patrons of your establishment, especially young children who might be enamored by a friendly ""pet,"" I think that it's good to know that if someone requests that their service animal be left to their job, they have the right to reasonably expect this.  Additionally, this can create an awkward situation for those in need of a service animal, b/c who wants to tell a young child that they can't pet your dog?  But, ultimately, they have a job to do, and your support will always make it easier for the person in need of the service animal.  Just something to consider.

Aside from this, I would like to commend you for coming here and seeking information on this subject.  I think that if more people did what you've done, it would make the process of taking a service animal out in public easier.  Basically, what I'm saying is, thank you having been accountable enough  to inform yourself on this topic. :D",,,3,0,0,

The hearing generally ends with a ""vocational expert"" testifying about what jobs are available for someone who has the limitations that the ALJ thinks you have. Your goal for the hearing is to convince the ALJ that your impairments cause functional limitations that make you understand to work.

You always have the right to say something. This is your chance to stand up for yourself and tell a real person why you can't work. Being specific helps.

2. I performed these tests or examinations while I've been treating [your name]:  [names and dates of any examinations and/or tests]

3.  From my testing and examinations, I diagnosed [your name] with [list all the different diagnosises]. 

4. In my opinion [your name]'s [diagnosis] causes [list symptoms]. 

[Repeat that for every diagnosis]

5. [List the treatment that your doctors' have done]

6. [Address every medication and side effects they cause]

7. [Have your doctor state your functional limitations from symptoms of your diagnosises]

My cane nowadays is a tactical battle hammer and armor piercing pike as the hand grip, and a rubber cane tip on the end of the handle.

The head and pike are bout 8 inches or so, and seeing that I am a big fella, fit my hand rather well, girth-wise.

I created a ""cap"" to disguise the lethal nature of my cane out of brown shipping tape, drawing faux wood grains and crumpling it to greatly resemble a piece of driftwood to cut down on the side-eyes from cops and nosy types wondering why a guy with a battle hammer was wandering around the kroger.

I just completed one, and was diagnosed with sleep apnea. I don't think it's the only reason for my fatigue, but the doctor thinks it may help. If you are not getting good rest then your body can't properly recharge itself and you will feel fatigued, the longer it goes on the worse it can be. 

My rheumatologist also added welbutrin to my meds. She has seen some positive results with using low doses to treat patients with CFS. 

There are lots of causes for fatigue, and it may be more than one thing. It may help to keep a symptom journal for a while. Write down when you feel the symptoms, what you were doing at the time, and be specific with what you felt. Ex: At 2pm I was watching TV and my vision went blurry and I felt dizzy for aprox 10 min.  Take this data with you to your next doctor appointment.

That said, here are a few suggestionsyou mentioned you were diagnosed w PTSD, ect by a therapist. a therapist is essentially a counselor, whereas a psychiatrist or psychologist is a medical doctor and receives much more extensive training. You may have better results if you seek out an actual psychiatrist or psychologist as they are doctors and their diagnosis can hold more weightall of this I'm here a few things I think you might want to try you mentioned you were diagnosed with your mental health issues buy a therapist that's great however you may have better results if you seek out actual psychiatrist or psychologist and they are talking to me and their diagnosis can hold more weight and disability cases. If there are alternative treatments for your given condition, it helps to build a paper trail of h.c. providers who concur with your therapists' diagnosis/prognosis. additionally it may be helpful to use a multidisciplinary approach for example your pcp, therapist, and other specialists works in concert to develop a plan of care.really try to build a team of healthcare professionals who had vouched for your condition as a united front. Be your own advocate. If you're insured your insurance company ombuds if you need help with this. disability wants to see that you have a significant enough condition to interfere with any kind of work, and that you've tried everything to improve your condition to no avail. As far as hiring an atty, IMO, it's definitely worth it. Meet w a few n feel them out. A consultation is essentially a job interview; they work for you. They can help to obtain documents, complete paperwork, attend court for you, ect. Lowell is the law where I'm at make sure that you do not have to pay the attorney until you get your disability settlement at which time we will take a percentage of your awarded amount. so you mean get to skrt it's important to maintain consistency in your records and care.

So when you are approaching your doctor to help support your claim, you should address the specific limitations that prevent you from working. Keep in mind that the typical standard for Social Security if you're &lt; 50 years old is basically an inability to perform any job, not just jobs you have done in the past, so a description of your past job duties is not particularly helpful. Usually that will involve addressing questions such as:

Is there some physical reason you can't sit, stand, and/or walk a total of 8 hours per day?

Do you struggle focusing throughout the day due to your symptoms and/or medication side effects to the point it would substantially interfere with your ability to work?

Do you have conditions that would regularly require you to miss a significant amount of work each month? 

Or conditions that require unscheduled breaks during the workday?

Your representative really should be walking you through this process, especially when it comes to helping articulate what specific limitations you have that are disabling.

The main exception to the above is if your conditions meet or equal a listing, which is a set of medical criteria developed by Social Security where they presume you are disabled if you have/satisfy all of the criteria specific to your impairment(s).",,,10,0,0,

Or is your lifegoal living on your own, living independently?

Living with a caregiver is, for disabled people, that independence. That caregiver is not family *and that's the point*. They're not, when they're good, nosy, invasive, interfering, they're not embarrassing, you can have your sex toys out on the bed, you can have your pride flags on the wall, you can do what you want, it's all fine, because they're just an employee basically, they're there to help you.

Unlike family who *are* nosy and embarrassing and curious and invasive and frequently bigoted.

And living with your family does not feel like independence. Living with a caregiver is *you* living on your own, with support. Living with family is living dependent on family. The whole mental connection is different.

You also typically get a bigger space to yourself living independently, but I'm not sure how the system works where you are. Here, typically a bigger space.

No judgement, at all, to those who live with family, out of desire or necessity. We all do what's right for us. I'm writing about why disabled people tend to want one over the other, not why one is better than the other.

I moved out the *instant* I financially could. I have support workers 10 hours a week. I would be back living with family without them. The fact that I need the support workers changes nothing for me. I wanted my own, bigger space. I was about ready to kms living in a box with no privacy with my parents, who I hated in that space.

I've never had a physician, nurse, PT, or other health professional refer to me using one of those terms when I see them for any kind of physical health related issue and that's regardless of how they were paid (via cash/insurance/pro bono).

 I have had the opposite experience when dealing with social workers/mental health care providers also regardless of how they were actually paid. Because of that, I feel it increases the stigma around MH-related issues as if they need to have separate terms to use for us in order to conceal and/or sugarcoat the type of care we're receiving.  Even if you're only using separate terminology to differentiate the type/source of payment then I still find that problematic. Perhaps if it was only used in writing for billing purposes I'd be more accepting but I've been called ""client"" and ""consumer"" directly to my face and have had SW and MH providers refer to other patients the same way. They sound colder and less neutral than ""patient"".

I prefer the term patient whenever possible. 

I don't really use the term ""victim"" very often because of negative connotations but I do say that I was ""victimized"" when referring to some of the abuse I've experienced. I'm not sure what to replace that verb with and feel it emphasizes that I had something unwanted (and illegal) done to me but I don't feel like a ""victim"", really, and think it sounds like a more permanent term when many people are able to move forward after abuse/crime/trauma. I don't use it for anything medical related but can understand why others might.

I don't like the word ""survivor"", either. Survivor sounds absolutely ridiculous to me and I will never use it because I feel like it forces people to only acknowledge positive aspects of whatever they're going through and that people are less accepting of ""survivors"" that are still struggling. I correct people that refer to me as a survivor or victim but don't have a problem with other people using those words for themselves.

I use the terms ""sick/ill"" somewhat frequently to describe how I'm feeling from my physical disabilities. I think it's very easy for most people to identify with what it feels like to be sick/ill and do not feel like those words have negative connotations/stigma and they can be used for both temporary/acute and chronic conditions.

Unfortunately I cannot transfer the money in attempt to afford ourselves a repayment plan because it’s not even *my* money. It’s my husband’s money and the SSA already look into his accounts. He and I were forced to give SSA access to his accounts instead of simply terminating SSI and starting a repayment plan because I would immediately lose Medicaid coverage. They would learn his income next year from the IRS anyways. I believe there is no way for us to argue a repayment plan.

For every professor, I was given a letter from the disability resource center (it had a different name at my college)that informed them that I had a medical disability and what accommodations they would be required to provide, and the contact number of the resource center in case they had any questions. In the very rare cases that letter was not enough to convince a professor that my accommodations were necessary, I would email them (coping it to the coordinator at the disability resource center) stating politely but clearly what I expected and their legal obligations and how the issue needed to be resolved (like providing PowerPoint printouts, or allowing me to reschedule a test after I had been absent). That was always successful for me. 

Thankfully, my mother is incredibly supportive. She also has a chronic illness (she has lupus and we both have a blood clotting disorder), so she understands. It’s going to sound like I’m totally spoiled, but I had been seriously ill my senior year of high school (I missed well over 80 days of school). My mom did not want to limit me from accepting the scholarship to my dream school, but it was hundreds of miles away. So she moved to a town not too far from where I went to college so when I was sick I had support. My other family, my brother and extended family, are very ableist and either dismiss my need for accommodations (“you can’t expect the world to change for you”) or dismiss my abilities (“oh that’s impossible”).

If that’s your question...god where to even start.

1. These “magic words” do not exist. Period.
2. Each patient is individually evaluated based on the criteria on the SSA site.
3. The best way to communicate your situation to the SSA evaluator is to get your docs to support those criteria as outlined above.
4. Your “helper” or *lawyer* should be helping you to collect the correct info in an easy to digest format.
5. The fact that the person currently “helping” you (who will be paid the same as a lawyer but is not a lawyer and is clearly not doing lawyer level work) has not already made this clear is very distressing.

Look, I used to be an engineer, and the most important thing I learned was to be sure I was asking the right question, attempting to solve the real problem. Everyone is telling you that “What should I get the doc to write to get approved?” is the wrong question; it doesn’t work that way.

Think of it like a court case: the jury decides on the totality of the factual evidence, not on a few magic words. You must present a totality of evidence that is for your case. The person you are working with should be organizing and spearheading that.

I’m going to leave you with this, though it is clear you don’t want to hear it, and I don’t blame you as this is a tough situation, BUT, a 95% clearance rate, if that is even factual, means they pick “easy” cases.

Instead we have strangers com into our homes and assess our needs verbally but never see what those words are in actions. Allocating minutes to use the bathroom in a day, and how “fast” we have to get dressed by PCAs. It is a system that discriminates by need, trying to put those that are disabled “away” with the slogan being said the same time “we promote independence and equality for the disabled.” BULLSHIT! This young woman deserves the same chance, opportunity, and has the same rights as ANY AMERICAN! But because she, like so many, need extra help, she’s pushed aside by the system and written off. The ADA needs to be enforced more and not let people hide behind the “undue hardship” exceptions. We are punished for trying to make something of ourselves, because when we make over a certain salary, they cease all benefits. WE DO NOT CEASE BEING DISABLED BECAUSE WE MAKE A CERTAIN SALARY! We should stop being punished for pushing ourselves just as is our right.

You know with the double standard is here? I have over 1000 friends on Facebook, and only 99.5 of them responded in someway to this horrific example of the inequality people like us face every day of our lives. Too many people don’t look at our situation but rather ignore it because it doesn’t affect them. And until it actually affects them, Many don’t even care. And that’s what sad, because I’ve seen too many people get in accidents and at no fault of the victim, people flock around them and rally behind every word they say or do because they weren’t born like it. As horrible as it sounds, I’ve witnessed and experienced it first hand. And it is beyond the control of accident victims or those that have horrible diseases that manifest later in life, allowing them to live a somewhat normal life up until the moment the disease becomes obvious, people view them as different despite us all falling under the disabled community in someway. And that’s a double standard that needs to be broken. I Collett the Disability bubble, that anytime someone with a disability goes in a room and sits down/pulls into a desk most people leave a space of empty desks if they have the option to around that person that’s disabled in many instances. And I tested this thoroughly in college, and it held up  more times than not. butWe all deserve the attention that we are yearning for when seeking equality in for their discrimination the end. We don’t have a voice with only a small amount of us are actually heard. 

I’ve said it before and I will say it again, the disabled community is truly the last to be systematically discriminated against and in many instances segregated from the rest of the population under the auspice of places failing to accommodate the physically disabled. What a kick in the ass is, air travel is not regulated under ADA title III as a public accommodation, whereas trains public transportation like buses and subways and taxis are required to accommodate under the ADA. 

It is a major, major, MAJOR reason I am where I am, entering my final year of law school, because I wanna change the lives of anyone with a disability in whatever way, so they have more opportunities and they have now. I want equality, but I know it will never be truly obtained. And some people read this and say “But you have preferential treatment in parking lots, and cutting the line and other places, not have to pay at some events, etc.” And where that is true, it’s an attempt to make up for all the other things that people fail to recognize, at times due to no fault of their own, the amount of things that people like us cannot do and never will do at no fault of our own.

If you’re able to make it work, I recommend getting up front, but it all depends on your situation and how comfortable you are with it. I go to mostly small venue shows with general admission, no seats, just standing area on the floor. I went to a lot of metal shows in high school with my old man. These days it’s mostly punk and alt rock shows. But they’re usually always in smaller venues or bar venues. Some of the smaller venues have wheelchair accommodations, but most of the bar venues do not. In order to see the show I need to be right up front against the stage, or barriers if there are any. Being in a wheelchair if you’re anywhere else you’re going to have people taller than you blocking your view. I tend to get to shows right when the doors open so I can get right up front. I also don’t drink alcohol at most shows because then I’ll have to use the restroom and it’ll be a pain in the ass to get back to my spot. Or in the case of one popular local venue, the restroom isn’t accessible. Neither is the venue for that matter. The bouncers have to carry me up two flights of stairs to get into it. But yeah, up front is where it’s at. You get a great view most of the time and you get the energy of the crowd. Like I said though, your comfort level comes into play. I go to a lot of shows where the crowd can get pretty rowdy. Lots of people pressing up against you. The occasional limb from a crowd surfer. People on the outsides of the mosh pit getting shoved your way. I love it, but it’s not for everyone. Everyone in the crowd with you is happy to see you though. They’ll help if things get too crazy and they watch your back even if you don’t want or ask them to.",,,2,0,0,
b47643f6-0945-4465-845a-1ddeb4f08808,1560294678,"Hi, I have cerebral palsy and just finished my first year of physics. I have fatigue issues so here are my tips for specific points. I'm from Ontario and study at the University of Waterloo but I know disability laws are fairly consistent across western countries.

Residence: Live in residence. They should have accessible options but you will have to formally request them. You can request specific aspects for the room such as having a larger space; the building like having a ground floor room; or the location being close to campus. It is helpful because many services such as tutoring, meals, recreation and counselling are provided through the residence. This was very important for me since it was a lot less running around and I was able to select a residence very close to all of my science and math buildings. I expect to live in residence for my whole degree.

Academics: University is brutal. Nobody cares about your feelings. Just being smart will no longer get you by. I made it through secondary school with a 94 average without much work. I have to take a reduced load to produce work at a level that is required for my future plans. They expect it to be 40-45 hours a week. Get to know your professors well so they understand your accommodations. You cannot miss class and they will not just tell you what you missed. You have to do the learning independently.

Accommodations: It is your job to provide proof you are disabled, what your limitations are and what accommodations are appropriate. This will come from a doctor. Plan for multiple discussions with the disability office and contact them as soon as you accept your offer. My specific accommodations include notetaking, scribes for homework, extra time, reduced course load, computer use, breaks during exams and no evening exams. For funding I get 10 000 $ from the government to pay for services related to university. This money can only be used for disability related services or equipment. Get this arranged early.

Your rights: Your university cannot reject you simply because of a disability; However, if it is preventing you from being a student they will expel you. This will affect you with your hospital stays and you may need to do online terms if you miss classes that much. The university and professors must accommodate you according to the accommodation plan you make with the disability office. Non-accommodated assignments may be re-considered if you prove there was a mix-up.

Living the life: Organize yourself and all your medical needs. Figure out how to get medication and framiliarize yourself with the student medical centre if you anticipate needing it. Plan how you will get around efficiently to reduce fatigue. I use a trike for this. If walking really fatigues you, your school may have a mobility van. This van will be limiting so you may want to explore a device instead. Make friends around residence and in your program. Have fun.",,,2,0,0,

That's fantastic. I went through VR in 2009 &amp; they got me tested +enrolled in around 6 months or less. Unfortunately, I started getting spinal injections &amp; was only above to get an A in one class &amp; not the other. I was too ill to think straight enough for statistics. Anyways, in 2013, I contacted them again &amp; they set me up to get my Bachelor's in Psychology, due to my scoring highly in the human services area of the vocational aptitude test. Long story short, they ended up paying for my 2 yr. Bachelor's &amp; my 3 year Master's in Clinical Counseling. It was hell, due to my limitations &amp; chronic pain, but I worked my ass off &amp; it was beyond worth it. They ended up paying for around $150,000 for me to complete my education. But just know that you have to work hard and keep your grades up for them to keep supporting you. They reimbursed me for all of my counselor licensing &amp; program evaluations that added up to around $600, plus all of my textbooks, etc. They also have a gas reimbursement program, once you are enrolled. 

Essentially, I am telling you that don't let a measly thing like a $1.50 bus fare stop you from attaining the American dream of getting your entire college education paid for IN FULL with zero debt. I understand you are ill &amp; that even the idea of it working out is stressful, but IT IS WORTH it. Dig through couches, ask someone to lend you the bus fare, pawn something miniscule that will get you enough money to get that bus fare. Maybe sign up for the job app Fiverr where you just pick a small job task someone posts &amp; after you do it they pay you $5. Start a gofundme for transportation fees. There's a ton of ways to get your hands on that bus fare. Consider how little figuring out how to get $1.50 truly is when you can literally get VR to pay up to $150,000 for your education. You will have to work hard &amp; coordinate with your VR couselor. Don't demonize them for this one dumb rule. I think it's silly of them to not be willing to pay $1.50, but do what you have to to get it, because you may regret it the rest of your life if you don't at least try. Even if they annoy you, please try to be nice to them, because, ultimately, they are the person you presents your entire case to the program coordinator for your area, who approves or denies your admission into VR services. Try to be kind to them bc they hold your future in their hands. You will need them to be on your side. If you make an appointment, try your hardest to keep it. Literally, please try hard to refrain from open disdain for them. Sometimes we have to grin &amp; bear it, while also faking it til we make it lol but it's worth it!

Also, they have very specific testing to pinpoint the type of employment that would best suit you &amp; your interests. I never, ever got crap from my VR ppl exhibiting doubt from those test results. Is your disdain for them by saying they've been dragging their feet possibly due to the fact that you may want to go into an feild that your initial testing did not correlate to be a good match for you? Better yet, have you taken the initial tests yet?

Outdoors the faces I get as my arm spasms out randomly or my face is stuck or my head's rattling back and forth. The faces I get. Even from family.
My colleagues at the conventions I help at cope better than my family with my issues like seriously. Then again husband and I do joke a lot. And we have meds on site who were close with if shit hits the fan.
But I guess around family they just don't know how to react. Like half a dozen of us have conditions.  Even my dad but I guess maybe because it looks ""scary"" people don't quite get it. Only one person in my family knows ms and even then not that we'll (she specialised in speech n language for ms a few years).

Sorry I've gone off on one.

Just wish folks would understand yeah I'm young(26) I can't just go get a job or drive etc. It's not an option because my ms has taken everything that'd be reasonable to use for being a constructive member of society.

Some judges will ask the attorney all the questions and may not speak to you at all. Other judges, like mine, may ask you questions directly. He did not ask a lot. Mainly about my work history, what I did at job X, that kind of thing, and why/how I left. As for my medical record specifically, he spoke directly with my attorney regarding that. 

Overall, I'm glad it's over, and it was nothing like I thought it would be. My judge was nice and seemed very kind and knowledgable. He listened to my answers thoughtfully. The vocational expert never spoke with the exception of hellos and goodbyes. The clerk was an angel who could tell how scared I was and told me that it would be over so quickly that I'd be looking at her like ""that's it?"" so don't worry. She was right.

SSA has more information [here](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/returning-to-work.htm).

You will probably owe taxes on your SSDI income given your employment income, so if your art is paying the bills, just save your SSDI checks in the bank until you get some sort of final determination on your year-end tax return, and from SSA when your work trial period is said to be complete.

The whole process will probably take about a year to complete. Play by the rules and you'll be OK. It's people who screw the system by working and not reporting it that get in trouble.

I'm still on SSDI but I've had several work trial periods and that's how it's worked for me.",,,2,0,0,

I can drive. But I can't sleep at night knowing I'm a danger on the road and choosing to drive anyway. 

Even with training to mitigate my vision issues (I have after image issues so I can't tell if cars are moving or parked) the risk of an accident is still greater than someone without my condition.

I want to drive, but I want to drive *safely* or I won't drive at all. And driving safely is not an option with the current level of treatment and occupational therapy available to me.

There are some disabilities that you can overcome and be a safe driver, and it's important people are empowered to try.

But no offence to that guys sister, if she's crashing into things then she's not managing her disability in order to drive, she's ignoring her limits and putting herself and other's in danger. how does she feel comfortable getting behind the wheel when she knows she's prone to crashing? What if she crashed into a child?

I tell people ""I can't drive, I have a neurological condition"" since my vision issues are technically a processing problem in my brain and not a problem with my eyes, and while my connective tissue disorder causes the subluxations which cause the dysfunction in my joints it's my nerves that mean I can't control the pedals or wheel properly. So I feel like ""neurological condition"" is enough information to explain why glasses won't help, and why, yes, I look healthy, but there's more going on in my body that means it's not safe for me to drive and I don't want to put anyone else in danger by ignoring my issues and driving anyway.

I would urge you to do this before you accept an offer to attend. Take your power chair and be prepared to talk to them about your limitations and needs. Set up meetings with housing and disability teams and try and guage how much they are willing to work with you.

Tell them you need an accessible dorm so you can properly use your mobility aids and tell them you have medical needs that will mean sharing a room is not appropriate. Ask about being able to record lectures as needed so that you can pace yourself properly and make sure that you explain how not being able to do that will result in hospitalization. It would probably be better for you to be housed on campus for your entire degree so make sure to bring that up.

If they can't or don't seem to want to accommodate your needs, I would strongly suggest you look at other universities. There is no point in going to a good university if it means coming out with a poor degree. I was steered towards going to a better university with no real weight put on accommodations for my disability. It is one of my biggest regrets. I had a university that was going to have me live on campus for the entire degree and they had a student who has similar issues before me so knew how to deal with much of it. If she couldn't make it to lectures then each of the lecturers would catch her up on what she'd missed face to face in her flat if needed. Instead, I ended up having to fight my way through my degree with very few accommodations being made. It took me two years longer than it should have done and my grades suffered greatly as a result.

It is possible to do a degree, but you need to put your health needs first. It doesn't matter how good they are in a particular subject, if they won't give you the accommodations you need then I would suggest looking elsewhere. If they are able and willing to do what they can to help you then that is wonderful, but you need to find that out before you commit to going there.",,,1,0,0,

In special regards to ""Always Ask"", though, I would point out that a lot of students are unaware when coming to college that they have to ask at all - in K-12 they are often handled with kid gloves (in fairness most students before college are now). They have to learn to advocate. Additionally, accommodations are never retroactive. You have to have them in place before an issue or problem arises. Going forward, accommodations will be in place to assist, but they will not change the past. Meaning if you don't speak up and never get notes from your class and wait till the night before your midterm or final to reach out - there isn't a lot for us to do. 

I would, also, like to add that all students in college should develop relationships with their professors. Often times, professors are willing to do more than the law allows. At my particular university, professors set their own attendance policy and students are obviously allowed to miss if they have medical or disability reasons - but they have to be reported and documented. Many professors will let students miss though if they trust the student is working hard in their classes. I have seen professors allow students to make up work up to a full year after the class ended. 

I would love to see an episode on the actual processes to register at different universities. We are all online and many colleges have switched to this in our state. Higher Ed institutions never accept just IEPs or 504 plans - but high schools insist that this is all you need. Students sometimes assume that their disability records are sent with their transcripts to schools from their high school or that their disability accommodations transfer from previous community colleges and universities...",,,2,0,0,

[This](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/your-money/able-accounts-savings-disabled.html?login=email&amp;auth=login-email) article is a pretty good explanation of some of the benefits.

My understanding is that these accounts allow savings (from earnings, gifts, etc) to accumulate without impacting any other benefits being received, sort of like the 529 college savings accounts.

From the NYT article:

""The maximum from all contributors is pegged to the annual gift tax exclusion, currently $15,000 a year. Also, as a result of the 2017 tax  overhaul law, **ABLE account owners who work may contribute extra money** from their earnings — up to $12,140 in most states (the amount is tied  to the federal poverty level and is higher in Hawaii and Alaska), for a  total of about $27,000 a year.

In many states, balances in ABLE accounts can grow up to $300,000 and often much higher"" For example, in California, the account limit is $529,000.

This allows a disabled person to save for future needs or use the money for current disability-related costs, like health care, housing, transportation, education and training, without losing government help.

States which offer exempt ABLE accounts differ in their implementation but [here's a great website](http://ablenrc.org/) for comparison of state programs.

I really hope that more people become aware of these accounts...they can make a huge difference in the quality of our lives.",,,1,0,0,

7716495d-928e-4a54-9274-1028888036f6,1561087187,"Society I think pretty much the world over is geared towards distrusting the disabled at best, and hating the disabled at worst. Remember that not all that long ago if you had any kind of disability you were probably either extremely sheltered or put in an institution, or both. Unfortunately, there are typically two key reasons for it.

The first is almost innocent, in that most people wouldn't know what to do with a disabled person if we came with instruction manuals. Depending on the disability, there's about a 99% chance that you're going to be the first person John Q. Professional has actually seen with that disability. If I had a dime for everything in my life that I've been the first blind person to do, I wouldn't need to worry about whether or not I can convince someone to hire me despite the eyes being pretty much useless.

The second and probably more important of the two is there are people who's interests would be best served by us being out of the way. Unfortunately, most of those people end up in positions of influence--government, medical professions, employers, etc. The second costs need to be cut somewhere, expect most of them to hit us more than the average person. The second someone needs to look good, expect them to try to put the spotlight on us for reasons. And the second you look like you don't need what they're offering, they won't be able to process your exit fast enough. It's sad, but it's a fact of life.

But if/when you find it, if you’re willing/able to do low-level dev work in a low-stress setting, you’ll be an absolute steal for the company. If they aren’t stupid, they’ll work really hard to accommodate you and keep you happy, in my experience. 

Sorry this is so long, but I hope my experience helps. I also have a background in tech and am on SSDI and ran into a similar problem. I’d look through job listings for smaller companies that talk about why the applicant wants to work for them, rather than just their requirements for an applicant. I fell into a very lucky job situation by applying to exactly 1 job, a telemarketer position, at an office walking distance from my house, that I chose because the job was easy and met all of my physical requirements and the company looked like they genuinely cared about their employees (check glassdoor etc.). I majorly downplayed my resume to get the interview and then wowed them with my experience in the interview (still downplaying though). Turns out though they were advertising for a part time employee they actually wanted full time, but made an exception for me and let me create my own schedule. Within a month they put me in a data analysis position and by the next month I became their in house web-developer and started doing product management. The great thing about this is they are getting an experienced developer for pretty much no money, which makes me basically irreplaceable, and gives me a lot of goodwill to burn at the company. 

I’m not able to do the job I could have done before I was sick (I find myself needing to look up basic syntax and forgetting pretty basic stuff and I’m much slower) and I’m not as reliable as they’d want and deserve if they were paying me market rate, but it all works out in the end because they aren’t paying me market rate. So no stress, things get done when they get done, I can work from home when I need to, I don’t feel bad about calling out when I need to, and whenever I need accommodations they are more than happy to provide them.

End of the day, I think your best bet is find a company that needs tech work but can’t afford it. I’d look for places hiring part time marketing assistants who need Wordpress and other low-level development experience. I landed my current roll in the company by hearing them do phone interviews for that sort of position and realizing that I could way better give them what they actually needed. I find those sorts of rolls are generally the ones who actually need a developer but can’t afford it.",,,2,0,0,

I think *because* Apple products are so expensive, they can afford to invest more in features, including accessibility features. It’s just ridiculous that accessibility should be seen as a “premium” feature rather than something that is required for all products, but the ADA and similar laws aren’t really designed for that, and also can’t take into account the patents and stuff which makes accessibility features hard to standardize across the board. 

It’s yet another problem with profit-based capitalism...things that really do help people are considered “value” that you have to pay for to use, even if you should be able to get those features without the premium price tag. 

The best solution I can come up with, within the current system, would be a way for insurance to partially subsidize products that have a proven accessibility benefit. However, that kind of brings up the problem you describe, in a different way - it is incredibly difficult (and itself inaccessible) to police disability in a way that would allow fair distribution of these subsidies, and of course would be subject to abuse.",,,6,0,0,

-

but not all disabilities are like that. some disabilities are all curse and no blessing. you really have to ask yourself if you would be ok with your parents conceiving you knowing what kind of challenges you will face.

-

you also have to ask yourself if you can do your duty as a parent with the disability. if you got your disability from some sort of accident then there isn't any chance of passing that along to your children but it still might leave you unable to raise the child properly. if that is the case then you are putting a great burden on other people and on the child. thats just not fair.",,,4,0,0,

I decided that for me having a child would be too selfish and even self-sabotaging.I chose to have a hysterectomy when I was twenty-one. I have endometriosis, and the pain was debilitating through my teenage years.

I figured that if the hysterectomy helped, I could have a  better life, even though it meant I would never be able to have children in the usual way. It worked. I still have chronic pain, but it is manageable.

Before, I was bedridden 25% of the time, and taking opiates 50% of the time. I couldn't live alone, or work, or finish a semester of school. I didn't think that I could ever sign up to bring a child into that life. How could I tell my child that I don't want to read to her, or play with her, or even have her in the room with me? Not just once in a while, but for a week or more of every month? How could I ask a partner to be willing to be my love-in-nurse and a single parent for that same week? I just didn't want that for myself or my hypothetical family. 

But, my situation is unique(ish) to me. Having considered this question and answered it for myself, I think this question is one everyone considering having children should ask themselves. What would I want for my potential child, and can I provide that? 

You can avoid passing on genetic conditions by adopting or by using a sperm/egg donor. 

But kids take a lot of spoons, no matter how they come into your life. I love kids, but I'm going to have to be satisfied with the kids of my friends and family.

It's not 100% about money, but depending on the level of care needed, it can be exhausting (emotionally, physically, and financially) caring for a loved one. Using caregivers and SNFs may allow a family member to work and still provide support from a distance. Would you be able to financially support yourself and another person if you had to care for them, take extra time off work to go to doctors appointments, and help them get ready for bed/get ready in the morning every single day before you could go to work or go to sleep?

Parents and family members also have to plan for when they are unable to care for loved ones. Age and illness are very real things. Would you be able to care for someone while going through chemo or when you're 70?

I've was a young carer, I am a carer and I'm a caree. Caring for a family member is emotionally devistating and can give the caree a sense of feeling trapped and a burden. Long term that can screw with family dynamics. Having a sheltered accomodation (your own apparentment with care workers coming in and out regularly and staying in site) and care homes allows family dynamics to recover in some ways.

f93de254-4778-402f-8cfe-8ebea17b6f1f,1560285196,"Yep. I have a lot of stories, but this one is probably the most unique: at my high school, the elevators in he academic building were old and only faculty and people with elevator passes are allowed to use them. The only way to get an elevator pass was if you had a temporary injury or disability that impacted your ability to take the stairs.

I use crutches or a wheelchair on a daily basis, so I had a permanent elevator pass. Nearly every day, students expressed their jealousy that I was allowed to take the elevator. Look, the elevators are rickety and the cables have snapped more than once. If the elevators were down, I either would have to brave the stairs and risk injuring myself or just not go to class... and they were down a lot. If I could take the stairs every day, I would. 

One student even told me that she’d been faking a twisted ankle so that she didn’t have to take the stairs. If I could’ve knocked her lights out, I would’ve. People faking injuries were actually pretty common, though. 

Students took the elevators (with fake injuries or just entirely without a pass) all the time, and the more they were used, the more often they broke down... so it made me (the only student with a permanent mobility impairment) and the one disabled instructor. 

One time, the power was out and the elevators and air conditioning were down... on a 96° day. Heat worsens my heart problems, so I was ready to faint by the time I’d climbed up to the fifth floor. My instructor insisted on walking me back to my residence building because I was in such bad shape. 

Another anecdote: anyone was allowed to use the elevators in the residence building bc the building was new. I also depended on these elevators to get to class. However, able-bodied people would cram into the elevators just so they wouldn’t have to go down a single flight of stairs. There was more than one occasion where the elevator doors opened to reveal a crammed elevator and the students would just shrug and not attempt to make any room for me even though I was the only one who really needed the elevator. So... I be late to class because I’d have to struggle to go down the stairs and walk across campus. Thankfully, I had a solid 504 plan and really understanding instructors. I was rarely more than a minute late to class anyway.

Exactly this. Be wary when questions are mostly about your disability and not your hobbies and opinions. I've also been asked how I cath though thankfully not to video it! Eurghbleurghvom. Some are more subtle but a lot are brick in face level of obvious. I'd watch out for; 

- questions about personal health issues they will not be involved in 
- repeated prodding on one topic when you've given a clear answer
- 'worship', being a little too enamoured with your atrophy or overly precious about your chair 
- allowing you to struggle with a hill, transfer etc if you've made it clear you'd like help

So the therapist I saw actually did want to put me on a couple medications, but I turned them down cause I wouldn't have been able to afford them.
So I'm not sure if she was a therapist who was going to refer me to a psychiatrist for the meds or if she was a psychiatrist.


That was the 1st time I had ever been to one and ironically I wasn't able to make myself go back again cause of my anxiety lol



My experiences with people finding out I have anxiety is always dismissive. 
Or someone with a full time job in retail will say, ""Oh yeah, I have anxiety too""
Not saying that they don't, of course, but at this point in my life, I couldn't work a full time retail job without having panic attacks and an eventual mental break down...



So I guess I'm nervous about pursuing the disablity and being dismissed cause anxiety is ""not that bad"" and I can just suck it up and deal with it.",,,1,0,0,

I have dumping syndrome (stomach is too fast at emptying), intestinal neuropathy (everything after that is paralyzed), and hypoglycemia caused by hyperinsulinemia (pancreas over producing insulin) 

That’s awesome stats on your academics! Congrats! How did you educate staff without seeming ‘disrespectful’, (or with a backup plan to defend yourself)? That’s definitely good to know about professor thing as i wouldn’t have thought of that comment meaning they’ll fail me, but it definitely makes sense. Yeah I’m not to worried about the food situation, other than financial concerns which is irrelevant to the disability discussion. I did eat there on my tour and they had quite a bit of options, and I don’t think they care much about eating together or anything. Sounds kinda bad to say, but I don’t care too much about healthy, as long as my vitamins are good enough to not cause any other issues, I’m fine

If you don’t mind me asking how was your family support? I’m in a family of ableds so 1. They don’t understand disability issues 2. They don’t predict/expect them the way I do either, from my perspective, you give ableds an inch, they take a mile, so I don’t inch, whereas my family sees my as unreasonable over a little thing 3. They overly justify common forms of ableism/non-Accessibility, they essentially think it’d be impossible to make the world accessible (ex, ramps instead of stairs) and unless someone is disgustingly/overly ableist they chalk it up to ‘lack of education’ and my responsibility to educate them 4. Being quick to smash unrealistic dreams/jokes or basic plans. If I say it’d be cool to swim a mile one day, ill have them all up on me about how I’d fail at that and it’d never be an option, if I joke that I’d wanna climb Mount Everest or something, that would be teared into and probably insult me based on my disability a lot. If I say I wanna have a sleepover at a friends they’ll be like “What if you get sick”, and a ton of super unlikely scenarios.

To go to my son's wedding a 5-hour drive away, we decided to fly since a  5-hour ride in a car would almost guarantee I was too whooped to go to the wedding. So the first lap is okay and then a long extended delay until the sign said canceled and then they decided, without asking or talking to us, to put us on a bus and drive us the rest of the way! Uh, didn't I buy a plane ticket since I wouldn't have to ride in a car/bus? The driver was a maniac and on his phone the whole time. No seatbelts so hubby had to hold me in the set when we hit potholes at 65 MPH and also had to help brace my neck.

It doesn't justify their behavior, but I personally have always found explanations somewhat helpful in handling tough things. My short advice would be to try &amp; not let any of this get you down. You can only control the controllables and you only have so much energy in any day, so you have to consiously decide how to use it, and it would best be used in doing things that make you happier and healthier. I'm sure with time this will all become easier. Also, if you aren't already, get comfortable advocating for yourself. You are #1. Your feelings (all of them) are valid and you deserve to be treated like the lovely human that you are. I know when I first became disabled one of the hardest things about it was feeling useless / of little value to society. Add in the fact that I have to ask for help (from so many avenues) and it makes sense to question your worth and the way others treat you (if it's not great).

I would obviously be open to dating a woman with a disability if she wanted to date me as well (the girl I've been hanging out with has depression, which is considered a disability). I would probably be open to dating a woman who is also in a wheelchair, depending on our connection, but it is my preference to try and date able-bodied women. I don't think that makes me a hypocrite. In our culture people are surprised when a person in a wheelchair and someone who is not are dating, and I think it's ableist to assume that disabled people only date other disabled people.

And I will agree with the poster below - stickyDan - that many logistics would need to be considered if I were to date someone also in a chair. My diagnosis is very challenging in and of itself, and I don't think I would have the mental capacity to worry about both my condition and someone else's, who could have as many difficulties as myself, if not more. I have a hard enough time as it is trying to remain positive in my life. And as stickyDan also said, I am not expecting all women to accept me and my wheelchair - that would be ludicrous.

I have this coworker who gets very angry easily. If we don’t have an item, we often advise the customer on where they can go to get the item. I typically recommend a similar store to the one I work in that is close to where our store is. My coworker always recommends this one store that is a couple of miles across town. He gets angry when customers say that they don’t want to walk that far. I pointed out to him that they may not be able to walk that far. He said ‘these people are fine, you can tell they’re just lazy’ but like... you literally can’t tell?? Also, a huge portion of our customers are elderly. So of course they can’t walk all the way across town. But still, my coworker refuses to recommend the store that is closer to us.

Also, this same coworker was complaining about people walking slowly on footpaths. I pointed out that not everyone can walk quickly. He said ‘oh, I never think about that, I just get angry’ and brushed it off.

Now I’m doing uni online as well as lots of hobbies and spending time with friends. I’m still underweight, but not as extremely, and my diet is a lot better. You won’t get better, but you can learn to cope with your condition. 

It’s different with everyone: my sister who’s diagnosed as well got back into school by doing graded activity, whereas I just kind of threw myself in and figured out how to cope as I went along. I had to drop out of mainstream uni and live at home because I had a flare-up, but it’s given me the opportunity to learn healthy habits. For exercise I’d recommend swimming because it doesn’t put pressure on your joints. If you’re not well enough for swimming, see if theres anywhere near you that does hydrotherapy. I also have an inflatable hot tub (£500 from B&amp;Q) which cost a lot, but it does wonders for my joint pain. Electric blankets are excellent too - if I come home from a long day I’ll often spend the evening tucked under my electric blanket!

Look into elimination diets as well. I’ve gone vegan, and a lot of people who have ME have seen a lot of health benefits due to veganism (try Deliciously Ella), but for some people it’s gluten free that works, and for loads it’s cutting out sugar. Experiment, and figure out healthy quick recipes that don’t take too much effort to make. Leftovers are your friend!

Case in point: I emailed Nintendo using their “accessibility” email address seven months ago about adding more accessibility features to the Switch, requesting they either make future games compatible with the XBox’s adaptive controller or make an adaptive controller themselves. They responded back with a form letter thanking me for my input but saying they have no plans to do either option at this time.

&amp;#x200B;

If the response is just “We’re not going to do anything,” why bother even having an email address devoted to accessibility issues? I’m a customer who wants to give you my money, but I won’t if your product won’t work for me or if I have to spend hundreds of more dollars *making* it work for me.

I can't walk. The doctors can't figure out what is going on and I'm still in the process of being diagnosed. I'm seeing different specialists along the way. I was an independent contractor so I had no medical insurance. I just woke up one day and could no longer put any weight on my feet and have to be in a wheelchair for any mobility.

My main problem is that I can't walk and without being able to walk I can't be independent. So I need help. And in order to get help you have to apply for food stamps, emergency financial assistance, medicaid, ssi, transportation assistance, etc. etc.

It requires doctor appointments and medical staff to sign off on things, it requires tons of forms, phone calls, etc. with various agencies.

My issue isn't so much with the general public as it is with the industry that fuels these programs. Whether it's doctors, nurses, social workers, etc. there's just this constant stigma/tension about my authenticity. Most people that I used to meet would give me the benefit of the doubt when I told them something. Like if I told someone that my favorite color is orange, and that I like playing baseball, or I enjoy the summer, the natural response is to believe those things.

Dealing with these agencies for help it's the total opposite. If I tell them my favorite color is orange, I'm probably going to need to tell them 100 more times along the way, and provide 3 different forms of proof. They will ask me a hundred different ways what my favorite color is so that they can catch me saying that I might like blue instead of orange.

Kentucky expanded Medicaid to cover disabled people. Tennessee did not. If you don’t have Medicare yet, you would have to buy private insurance in Tennessee, which can be very costly. 

The downside to Kentucky is the lack of healthcare options outside of major metropolitan areas. I have lived in rural Kentucky and it’s hard to find doctors and specialists outside of the big cities like Louisville, Lexington, Covington/Cincinnati area, and possibly Bowling Green or Owensboro. Also, if you are food insecure, rural areas are going to be tough to find food banks without driving 30-50 miles.

A doctor will review your medical records and decide if they are complete enough, or if a second opinion from another doctor would be necessary.

You'll get letters in the mail letting you know if you've been approved or denied. About 60% of cases are denied the first time. If that happens, you can re-apply with a disability attorney to increase your likelihood of success.

If you are approved, you'll know how much your benefit will be, when it will start, and if you are entitled to any back-pay (starting five months after your date of disability).

I was in a unique case. I have bipolar disorder. I applied once after my disability started, but went back to work so I cancelled the application (it was denied by default). After trying to work multiple times, I applied again. During the application process, I went to the hospital twice (my fourth and fifth stays). I was approved in about six weeks. It's a miracle that it took such a short amount of time, and that I was approved without an attorney. They said my first application denial was a large part of the decision actually, it showed that I tried to work after becoming disabled and was unable to do so.

If you can, take the day at your own pace. Try to find maybe a couple of people who are familiar with your situation. They might be able to accompany you or at least keep an eye out for you in case you need to take a break or need to step aside from the events. If worse comes to worst, excuse yourself to go take a break and rest/recharge (if this is an option).

Try to adapt the situation to best suit your needs. If your cane will help, use it! People will understand. You have to look after your body. If using something to adapt yourself to the environment will help a little then you’ll be thankful for it at the end of the day.

c5747d8f-2bef-48c3-ba95-25d6d8449fb5,1561308888,"It’s such a messed up system. I am in my 20s and on SSDI, and I really don’t want to be on it for the rest of my life. I want to get healthy enough to go back to working and paying taxes and being (as they say, even though I hate the connotations and my apologies for the ableist language) a “contributing member of society”. You’d think the government would want that too. But I cannot work full time right now. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to work full time. So I got a part time job originally earning over the SGA and hoped I could make it work after my trial work period even losing my benefits. This was the only thing that allowed me to get off food stamps. I couldn’t manage though and had to cut back hours. Now I’m using up my work trial on my very part time return to work and if my earnings end up low enough to stay on disibility, I will never be given the opportunity to attempt upping my hours and testing my ability to work more and get off disibility without immediately losing my benefits because I already used up my trial working part time. 

As it is now, I’m hovering right at the SGA and sometimes go over depending on how many work days there are in the month. That is not enough to live on. I will lose 50% of my income and my health insurance if I can’t explain to my job that I have to work an hour less on months with more work days. And if I do cut back to stay under SGA, there are those who’d say I’m cheating the system. Over $20 because of the government’s rediculous all or nothing rules. 

Even with ssdi and working part time, I wouldn’t be able to make rent even with roommates without my partner, and I wouldn’t have the money to move somewhere cheaper. Literally my options would be starve in the street and die because I couldn’t afford healthcare, or go on government assistance everything. Food stamps, medicaid, public housing, etc. because I was working too much for disibility every couple months by $20. I would become the “drain on the system” so many are worried about because of their own stupid laws that prevent people with disabilities from building a stable future for themselves.

I had a bunch of issues throughout my training - POTS lead to near syncope making standing for surgeries, especially with holding awkward positions, even harder. I developed some major GI issues in the last 6 months of residency leading to a lot of ER visits after long (30h) shifts and eventual multiple admissions &amp; a feeding tube I initially in my nose. I was sicker than a lot of my patients &amp; it was awkward. I used a mask to cover my face/nose. It eventually was moved to the abdomen. I currently am on TPN (IV nutrition) &amp; some tube feeds. My joints issues have been worse as well.

I made it through residency (Pediatrics), fellowship (global health but did not travel), &amp; took a full time community pediatrician job. My issues suddenly got a lot worse in 2017. I worked another year (mostly with a backpack which pumped in tube feeds or TPN) but had to cancel 74! clinic days, lot of call coverage. I resigned in 2018 &amp; activated my individual disability policy. I did work about another 4 months in a sedentary medical consultant job at Social Security processing disability claims but struggled to maintain the 15h/wk agreement. I'm not working at all now. 

This is just to give an example. Medicine is rough, more so with health issues but it can be done. I'm not sure I would do it again but I am happy with what I have done. There are more &amp; more accommodations, recognition &amp; support for disabled doctors.

They looked at me like I was nuts sitting in the electric W/C!  But one girl said okay than told me that they were the remodeling crew and were waiting for the boss to show up. They were all wearing the W/M vest and looked liked regular employees and no reason, since their boss wasn't there yet that they couldn't help out! I told her she had explained that to me I would have understood. But still, don't masquerade as a WM employee and then not want to help.

Classic lines from the movie and I took them to heart. Granted there are lots of things I can no longer do, but there are many things that having this in my life has brought me, some of which I had longed for many years. I had always wanted to be a stay home mom and maybe have a little business on the side. Well too late to be a stay at home mom, but since initially we thought I was dying (took almost a year for a diagnosis) I started selling some of my mammoth collection of books online, amazingly enough, it started a business on the side (something I had wanted to do) and when I could no longer source inventory and handle the weight of the books (torture for someone like me that has read at least 30,000 books in my lifetime) I switched to sell sewing patterns online. Something that is my hobby, so even though I go through days that I can't work at my hobby, I am surrounded by it. 

You will find that as the days go on, you will find opportunities to do things that you enjoy. Things that will give you fulfillment. If you don't look for them or take advantage when they come your way, you will lose out on a wonderful life. Get busy living or get busy dying!

I got the SSI Disability maximum of $770 and now I owe them overpayments for months in which I had $0 income because, as I understand it, my husband is a 1099 contractor as opposed to being someone’s employee. They take a monthly average from the EXPECTED yearly income for contractors. He couldn’t find a job, so he made his own job and now we owe back thousands of dollars because of it. 

All while soon denying me disability Medicaid because we’re over the monthly income cap as of now. To get half the coverage I had under Medicaid, healthcare.gov quoted me at $13,000/year. 

I can’t file a waiver or negotiate a lower price because I do not yet have specific insurance costs nor have we yet to move and thus pay higher rent or possibly a mortgage. They would take every penny that wasn’t allocated for food, shelter, healthcare, and work related expenses anyways—including our money saved for taxes. We could even be denied a monthly repayment plan simply because of the money we saved to pay taxes, let alone what we saved for stable housing and medical expenses.  **They will look in our accounts in order to tell us whether or not we can even get a repayment plan as opposed to paying it all at once.**

I have seen this repeatedly and it's one I'm completely confused about.  I don't know why having small children is an excuse? I was a single mom,  ages ago,  as my daughter is 20 now,  so yes she survived what I'm about to say. Anyway,  when we went to the store, and I got groceries,  I simply loaded all the groceries,  with her still in the cart.  Then I pushed the cart to the cart return,  with her still in it. Then I carried her back to the car and put her in it.  It's really not that difficult. To others it is it seems.  It reminds me of the riddle of the guy getting the animals across the lake in a row boat individually,  but doing it a certain way to make sure the animals don't eat each other while they're alone. So having small children doesn't absolve you from being inconsiderate. It's not some puzzle to figure out how to do things and not inconvenience others.

I try everyday through everything I deal with,  to remember and be considerate to others dealing with the same,  or worse.  Just the other day,  I had to walk my cart all the way back into a different grocery store,  because there were no returns anywhere close.  But humans should care about other humans.",,,5,0,0,

Since you use a wheelchair the disability office will also ensure your class is held in an accessible location. Even if you don't have many accommodations, it is very important to register early. Your notetakers may not be the best unless you ask about funding a hired scribe. This was one of the best supports I have gotten. The medical centre at my university is equivalent to a doctors office and is staffed with doctors (I have no idea what nurses' offices are like, we don't have them in Canada). Six days a year is not bad as long as they are not in a row.

With the dorms, one of the accommodations can be a single room as you have a medical need for space. Another thing is the housing office may be separate from the academic disability office. Part of my housing accommodation was being placed near my program's key buildings. I really think you should learn about your residence options specifically as a disabled student because it seems pretty wild that they could not accommodate you. It really is good to live on campus particularly with fatigue issues. They got some demanding physical tasks covered for you like cooking and cleaning. I don't want to upset you but if your living situation is not ideal, your marks will be lower. If your university really cannot accommodate you, choose a different one. Again for reassurance, the situation you are describing sounds illegal on the basis of accessibility so there must be more they can do.",,,1,0,0,

It didn't click with me until I had some understanding of the Social Model, and how my 'disability' is different from my 'impairment'. I'm disabled by society (infrastructually, culturally etc), but its my impairment that nescessitates the use of my wheelchair. 

Some folk say that language doesn't matter, and I respectfully disagree - the way we interact, in society, is sometimes based in category placements, how people define each other and being defined as 'a person with a disability' is a very specific, medical-model-charity-model somewhat patronising way to view said person. It may not be consciously held, but to remove someone's lived experience and relate it to an add-on in language means that its easier to inherently justify it being an add-on in practise. For me to name myself as disabled calls attention to the barriers in society that disable me - even if its just 'Oh I'm disabled' '..No, you're not disabled' 'Break your spine and we'll see how able you are to climb the stairs ..' explictly, or the implict normalisation that some people, in this society, are disabled. 

Other words seem more about reclaimation. I'll easy call myself cripple or spastic, and those words are easy used to describe me by friends and other disabled folk but, much like queer they can still be said with ill intent and be slurs. PWD isn't quite a slur, but its non preferential as it shows a underlying adherance to the idea that disability is so bad that you have to highlight the person, just so we all know ... and that attitude kinda sucks imo.

Furthermore, our laws are NOT necessarily based on the morality of Christianity.

3b2a621e-f130-438b-a1d9-3ce61f3dbc52,1561390079," Any task that could actually assist with a disability.  There isn’t a “right answer” as much as there are “wrong answers”.  “Emotional support” is a wrong answer (ESAs are specifically excluded from public access).  “Anxiety” or “allergy” is a wrong answer (these could be disabilities, but are not tasks).  That being said, “sniffs for allergens” or “does DPT to calm anxiety” WOULD be tasks (and would not be a wrong answer).  Most often they’ll keep it short (as they don’t have to give away their disability, nor should they have to).  “You can’t ask me that!”, is a very wrong answer (and anyone with a legitimate service dog will be aware of the two questions you can ask, as they are the only two you can ask).

The important part is to ask about tasks and not try to figure out their actual disability.  I’ll use myself as an example.  My username pretty much gives away my disability (in case it’s not clear, I’m Autistic, specifically Asperger’s).  However, if you didn’t know that,  but could see that I’m proud that I served (Army, but obviously my disability is not service related), and my answers are “medical alert, body blocking and DPT (deep pressure therapy)”, you might make an assumption.  Most people assume I’ve got PTSD, but I never even left stateside, let alone saw combat (and don’t have PTSD).  Guessing is usually pointless.

Basically, if it’s a task (an action that can be taken) that could mitigate a disability (any disability really as you won’t always know what theirs is), then it’s good.  It’s really the “wrong answers” you’re looking for.  Something fakers would say (“emotional support” is probably the most common), when they don’t actually have a legitimate service dog.",,,13,0,0,

That should cover for a lot of the physical access stuff - but to hit on the cultural as much as I can in a reddit comment: don't ask questions like 'what is your disability?' rather ask 'what are your access requirements?' - this not only empowers your disabled client/customer to say what they need, it means that those who don't ID as disabled don't feel they can't use the access requirements. This should be asked to \*everyone\*.

The diagnosis of the person, whether that's CP or ASD or whatever doesn't tell you as an access faccilitator anything. Asking about what's needed does.

Disabled person is generally safe language to use, though persons with disabilities is unlikely to offend. Where possible, just use access 'accessible bathroom' 'access information'.

And keep all printed/audio/signed materials in simple english i.e. no jargon, but assume competence in everyone you talk to. And talk to the disabled person, not their PA or interpreter unless this is explictly shown or requested.

What will be in your favor are therapist notes, doctor visits, hospital stays, and unsuccessful work attempts (UWAs). If that information still concurs that you are still disabled in three years, you'll pass your CDR. If you do not pass your CDR, [you have the right to appeal the decision](https://www.disabilitysecrets.com/benefits-ceased-continuation.html), probably best with an attorney, and you have a two month grace period before your benefits are terminated.

I'm not sure why mental illness isn't viewed as a permanent disability by SSA, which would put the CDR period at 5-7 years. The mental illness I am familiar with is a chronic issue and can only incrementally improve, if it improves at all.

Take this time to improve things for yourself. Take all of the therapy, medication, and other medical resources you need. With Medicaid and eventually Medicare, your medical expenses will be much lower than private insurance. 

I did TMS therapy, it was a massive help to my anxiety, and is very effective for depression as well. It may help you too. I'm still not successfully working, but I'm going to try working extremely part-time (10 hours a week, under the SGA amount) in a couple of months to see if I can work in any capacity.

Disabled people are usually too serious about life and too worried about life and their safety, thats what stops them from having fun, not their disability. And Im saying this 100% from personal experience.

I'm at the stage now where I kind of enjoy and get a thrill  of putting myself in stupid situations. Not because I want something bad to happen, but just because I prefer randomness than being static.  In my opinion a bad thing happening is better than nothing happening. Even in worse case scenario, if a bad thing happens to you - you have a story to tell, something that happened in your life - it might be something to laugh with friends , it might be something sad we all can learn from , but thats better than overthinking why disabled people cant enjoy anything and just waiting life to pass.

&amp;#x200B;

When I sad a kid I had a huuge crush/ being in love with a girl which was the most beautiful and popular girl in our school, approached by everybody etc. We had really nice communication and it was really fun when we hang out,  I  gave her gifts etc. Nobody believes me ( even my best friend of 20 yrs who knew her) about what happened next , which is  that she said she loved me 3 times in a row, I was such an idiot and when she said it to me i didn't replied  with anything and just said ""Ok"", she ignored me for a while afterwards, few years later she lost her life.  I don't know if she was serious , i dont know if anything would have worked out if she was.  But being a coward, bugs me to this day. Her death absolutely destroyed me, but still I'm so happy I met her. Now I'm in a wonderful relationship with amazing girl, she is my soulmate and I couldn't have asked for more, but this happened because I took a risk in a bad situation.

The  point of writing all this is  that its better to be mugged on the streets, be in the middle of nowhere  wondering how you would get out etc. than spending your whole life watching Bojack Horseman or reading Dostoevsky and thinking about the tragedy of life in the safety of your home.

In the end, all of human activities is some search for meaning in life and the pressure of being safe can totally destroy every good experience you could have.

Sure "" slamming chairs into"" your wheelchair might not be pleasant, but if you don't take that too seriously , you have a story to tell about that, if you put yourself in such situations you can meet people who you didn't imagined meeting in a million years. I think that is way better than having the perfect trip where everything happened according to plan  and definitely better than waiting for the perfect opportunity  for a trip. I have no idea if you would agree with anything that I said, but I personally prefer to have few stories to tell , few experiences to have, which are unique to me and shaped who I am, than living with the idea that, since I'm disabled I can't or could have not did the things I really wanted to and exchanging them for whatever is safe and suitable for a disabled person .",,,1,0,0,

Why has this person you’re paying thousands of dollars *not already done this*??? You absolutely should not have to turn to the internet to get these answers if you have paid assistance.

We’re not trying to be negative; we’re trying to protect you. I’d wager a large number of people here have been victimized by people who know people applying for disability are often too weak (limited energy) and have too few resources to fight back. Some of us have been taken advantage of by family members and “friends”.

Personally, I made contact with a “disability assistance” firm, which is what your friend’s mom sounds like. They were very good at giving me positive referrals, but when they outlined what they actually did, it was much less than a lawyer, they had no liability if they dropped the ball (unlike a lawyer who you have a contract with and can file a complaint with the BAR), and they seemed a lot more interested in making a huge deal about filling out a form for you rather than doing a thorough, good job. Basically, they wanted to make a quick buck off cases they thought they could win, where the medical evidence work seemed pretty much done, without investing in people with law degrees. They’re glorified form fillers amd borderline scammers. Your state probably has a *free* service that will do this, and possibly better since those volunteers care about what they do, not just a quick buck.

If you want to have some sort of guide for disability criteria for people filling out these forms, first place to check is the ssdi site itself: https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-eligibility-ussi.htm  These are the legal criteria a *lawyer* will work to and a judge will use to determine disability.

Asking a bunch of randos on the internet what they guess worked for their single, unique case (when their legal reps may know the real answer), is much less useful than talking to someone who has handled hundres of cases...you guessed it, a *lawyer*. 

And where on earth did you get those awful forms??? Are they generic forms for your diagnoses from the company this person works for? Good god, what an excellent way to get your doc to hate you and be denied!!!! These don’t help the doc describe *at all* in concrete terms what your work limitations are. They’re vague questions open to interpretation that only marginally justify a diagnosis, NOT define the work limitation consequences. They’re the definition of what to *not* do.

Seriously, if those garbage forms are from this company you’re working with, dump them NOW. Get real legal representation. **GET. A. LAWYER.**

Good luck. Seriously. You’re really going to need it.",,,15,0,0,

You don't want to be in a situation where someone wholly unqualified to make an opinion about your medical condition is responsible for determining your disability outcome. Disability attorneys work on contingency, meaning you don't pay them unless they win your case, and get a portion of your back payment up to $6,000, so it's no cash out of pocket for you.

A (good) doctor won't make judgments outside of their specialty anyways, and would recommend you see another specialist. All a chiropractor could do would be to measure your blood pressure and find that it's high, and wouldn't be able to explain the reason behind it, which is crucial information for your disability claim.

Do you see a psychiatrist for your bipolar meds? I'm surprised they didn't take your psychiatrist's records for a medical opinion.

The OUTDOOR mall has a Tiffany and Louis Vuitton and The Third Street Promenade - as the reason I say “fancy”. Also, I wasn’t going shopping in the mall (which I do sometimes but don’t use the OW then - cause I park in the structure and walk to stores).  I live in Brentwood (Los Angeles) and had to take care of three things south of the mall (which has the Pier, Beach, and restaurants that make driving and parking horrible). I park a few blocks north of the touristy areas and ride down (through the Promenade and through the OUTDOOR mall.) Going through the mall has allowed me to avoid some of the tourist on the side walk (the mall has a wider path). 

I have been issued crutches and canes to help with my mobility - and I’m trying to stay away from the typical motorized devices they offer veterans at the V.A. Hospital. I have enough money to buy something better and a bit practical - so I bought a Onewheel 2 years ago - and it has increased my mobility and ability to do more things outside and by myself.

Have you tried going through your state's vocational rehabilitation office? The counselors there can assess you and suggest jobs you might be able to do. If they say they cannot place you and can only help you achieve daily living skills -- then you have that on paper and it will help your case. There are numerous accommodations you can seek. If you need help locating your voc rehab office (It is usually under health and human services let me know and I will help you find them).   


You are young enough that you can still go back to school if your mental health can handle it.  Note that schools have disability offices that help with accommodations. Once upon a time I worked as a tutor/tester for students with disabilities in a community college. I'm so ancient that voice to text and text to voice was not as reliable and quick as they are today;  so some students needed readers to help, others needed someone to write down what they wanted to say. I had to speech-read them and touch-type.  But under ADA I could have refused those particular students. (there were other tutors/testers) I was being paid by the hour, so if I did not work I did not get paid).   


Anyway, I had some students with mental health issues whose medications slowed down their mental processes and made it hard to concentrate. My job was to help break down the information in bite sizes, teach them tricks in taking tests and guide them through directions while taking the test. Most of them also had extra time under 508 (and now IDEA) accommodations. I also had students who got extra time and help in writing papers. I taught them how to write and we talked our way through it, I would not just do the work for them and I left their thoughts and ideas even if they were getting the answer wrong. I was just there to help them get the ideas into a document in a way that made sense.   


Have you tried office jobs? I worked office jobs with severe hearing loss. I even worked when I had larger meetings and needed an interpreter. I can only function on the phone with people I know very well (like my wife and my mom). Thank goodness for email and messaging apps. Most offices use both of those now - and under the ADA they can accommodate you by always communicating via text. Mind you, the job cannot have phone use as a \*primary\* duty (reception and call center work for example). But when duties are \*secondary\* (talking on the phone to co workers) and can be eliminated or adjusted - it is considered a reasonable accommodation under the ADA. (it is always better to get things in writing anyway!) While there are people trying to erode the ADA it is still in effect thank goodness.   


I had a period of disability in my 20s due to severe mental health issues that had me in a revolving door inpatient and multiple days a week outpatient. (as well as the hearing and somemobility issues). Once we got  my mental health under better control (and it took a LOT of work in therapy to do it) I was able to go try volunteering and learn to apply my coping skills in the real world. Volunteering helped me figure out what I was actually able to do and the kind of work I would like to do. You can also work a small amount while on disability.   
I went back to voc rehab and they decided to send me back to school for a graduate degree.   


In order to go to grad school voc rehab sent me to sign language classes so I could use a sign supported speech interpreter to get through classes that were more technical than my undergrad had been - as well as handling large groups where it is difficult to impossible to keep up and figure out who is speaking and what they are saying. Under the ADA, workplaces all had to have an interpreter for me during any large meetings (I'm ok 1-1 and in small groups).   


I'm back on disability now because I now have vision impairment (even with glasses and it started as adult) and worsening mobility issues, as well as mental health issues that reared back up and worsened. (I went from being diagnosed dissociative disorder/PTSD to also having Bipolar and bipolor worsened along with my physical health. )  


My hearing was from childhood, but worsened when I was a teen and \*adds\* to the complication of other disabilities. Childhood disabilities count when they complicate new disabilities. You need to point out to the person reviewing your disability application \*how\* your hearing complicates your ability to work while dealing with your mental health issues. In addition, you need to spell out how your adult onset disabilities affect your ability to function day to day. Focus on your activities not the diagnosis.   
If voc rehab says they cannot help you - I would hire a disability advocate. I did not go through a lawyer, it was an office of paralegals that helped me. (AllSup). They helped me gather all the records, complete the forms and generally get everything organized for the application. They got a chunk of my back pay but it was worth it.

I have been disabled since birth, and for a long time crutches were my primary mobility aid, and my independence has always been very important to me. A few years ago, I began experiencing severe leg pain and became primarily reliant on my mobility scooter since then. At the same time, I also acquired a service dog trained in mobility. For people who have known me, they have struggled to understand this change in my lack of mobility and it’s impact on my life. Personally, it’s the first time I’ve ever felt truly disabled because the impact has been so limiting. What has helped me get through this without going absolute apeshit on people is realizing that a lot of these comments come from people who don’t not spend significant amounts of time with me and do not see every challenge I face and what the processes are for me to do a task that is simple for a non-disabled person. This does not excuse the unsolicited garbage coming from other people’s mouths, but it acknowledges that a lot of people cannot expand their perspective or capacity for empathy. Since your disability is new to you, I imagine you are experiencing a lot of new things that are overwhelming and disheartening. I hope that you can find an understanding support system to help you through this transition and hopefully develop some solid relationships along the way.

You mentioned she has a limited work history. SSDI requires a certain amount of work credits, you can find the amount on the social security website; the amount you need varies by age but it looks the minimum is at least 16 credits, or four years of work. [This website] (https://www.disability-benefits-help.org/faq/work-requirement-qualify-social-security-disability) breaks the concept down pretty well. So if she hasn't worked enough she wouldn't qualify for SSDI.

Without enough work credits she could potentially still qualify for SSI, but her spouses income would count when they determine how much - SSI is already pretty low so if the spouse makes a high income she wouldn't get much,possibly nothing.

&gt;I actually met an able-bodied woman on Bumble, and we pretty much hit it off, so we’ve been hanging out a lot. But I just found out tonight that she might be dating another guy too, which I guess I’m cool with, but I don’t even know if we’ve been dating. Either way I think she wants to keep things casual. 

Don't know if you haven't already, but if you're unsure about your status together, it's a good idea to ask. But this is besides the main point.

&gt;But I just feel like I’m never going to be able to compete with an able-bodied guy. 

THIS is the main point. 

I suffer no (fewer than I used to, at least) illusions about how difficult, tedious and frustrating Dating While Disabled can be. It can really eat away at you to think that something about you -- something you have no control over, something that most other people don't have to deal with -- can do heavily affect how many people will even consider you. And it absolutely, undeniably DOES. But eventually, if this kind of connection is something you truly want, you kinda need to have a hard talk with yourself and realize a few things.

Every ""dateable"" person out there is playing the same game: they're all looking for somebody who best fits their wants and needs. They all have preferences that help define their own set of acceptable partners, and they all have hard limits that help define everyone else's. Some limits and preferences are more common, and this gives some people smaller sets to work with (eg, us).

It's not fair that the system screws us like this, and you can (and should) be upset and try to change the way people see the world, but unless somebody is personally harmed as a result, you can't begrudge individual people their relationship biases, even if it's pure prejudice. As you know, everybody swipes left sometimes, and there's always a reason they do. 

However, in your case I would examine your reasons for not dating anyone in a chair. Not because it's wrong of you to do so, but because, by your own admission,

&gt;I’m not sure what it is, but I just don’t think I could date a woman in a chair - perhaps it reminds me of myself too much for comfort.

it may have something to do with how you view yourself. 

When people make the judgment call on somebody's desirability, they're not really thinking about that person; they're thinking about themselves. And they should, because that's how they take care of their needs. The problem here is you are doing this backwards: you are making a judgment call on your own desirability because you know you don't fulfill their needs. This is the self-defeating behavior.

Internalized ableism is practically unavoidable because it is spit at us daily that we are not good enough for this world. However, we can't change our disabilities, and when you've accepted that you need to look at what can be changed. ADA law, for all its flaws and omissions, exists because people in power were forced to admit that people with disabilities are just as human and worthy as everyone else. It doesn't make everything completely accessible, but it makes a lot of things more accessible.

Take a minute and know that you are just as worthy as any other single person. Just to a smaller group of people. What can you do to make dating better in spite of the stacked odds? Change the things you can, and stop thinking about the things/people you can't. If you blame your lack of success on your disability, which is forever (I'm assuming), it takes all responsibility and agency away from you and gives you no reason to try. Forever. Which is way sadder than one relationship that didn't make it.

Tl;dr, the world sucks and while you have relatively limited options because of your impairment, that's no reason to beat yourself down and give up. Stop thinking that disability is the only thing stopping you; focus on doing what you can and meeting the people that are interested in you.

Also, final note:

&gt;...what the hell is the use?” Why would a woman, especially an attractive woman, ever want to date a guy in a chair, like me? Am I just doomed for aiming so high? Just fuck my life..,

Nobody is entitled to an attractive partner. Not even attractive people. And there are plenty of UNattractive people who are not interested in you. Again, you have the right to filter candidates by as many terms as you like, but if conventional good looks are this far forward in your mind, enough so to make you think in terms of ""aiming high""... certainly don't aim below your needs, but think about what your needs really are here.",,,5,0,0,

Otherwise they would have people cutting themselves off without a safety net when they attempt to work, and then trying to jump back on if work didn't go well. To reduce the processes of jumping on and off, there are long grace periods like the work trial process to ensure someone is truly ready to go back to work without assistance.

If you haven't been making the amount over SGA (which I think is $800 a month?), those months won't count towards your work trial period. You have to make at least nine months over SGA to end the work trial period.

For the first - Let’s take disability out of it for a second. If a teenage mother chooses to keep her baby, is she selfish, knowing that her child may spend their formative years at a socioeconomic disadvantage? Would the answer be the same if it she has strong family and financial support? What about family *or* financial, but not both?

Everyone has disadvantages. If there is a plan to care for the child, I don’t think a parent with a disability is any more selfish than any other parent.

For the second half (genetic inheritance) - if you want a child, the alternative is adoption. You do not know with 100% certainty the medical and social background of the parents. If you feel strongly about passing or not passing along your genes, that is a very personal decision that only you can make. But selfish, in the grand scheme of things?

The biggest thing for me just boils down to respecting their/my wishes which can be more difficult if verbal/written communication is a part of the disability but I'm sure you have other ways to tell when they're unhappy with something. 

 One of my disabilities is that I'm autistic but I also have several others. I have identified as disabled for a long time. I once had a psychiatrist berate me because I called myself disabled and he became agitated and disrespectful to me and he kept being adamant that ""you are not disabled; you ***have*** a disability"". He was so hell-bent on forcing me to use person-first language that I never went back. I hadn't even heard the terminology ""person-first"" or ""identity-first"" at that time and also struggled a little to explain my feelings about it especially since he rejected my views outright and was treating me like shit. His lecturing became the main focus of the visit.

I also refer to myself in what some others consider derogatory language (retarded, crippled, etc) and while I know that makes some people uncomfortable I ***hate*** when the non-disabled justice warriors attack me for my use of this language, especially when I'm referring to myself, or when someone I'm close to uses that kind of language towards me and they get berated by people that have no business inserting their opinions. I do not appreciate people getting offended on my behalf as if I can't decide for myself what is offensive or not. I'm not asking anyone else to use language they're uncomfortable with; I'm simply wanting them to respect my decision to use it (or my friends to use it) and to back off instead of thinking I'm some helpless, pitiful being that needs a savior to prevent me from having my feelings hurt. 



As a side note, I am likely in the minority when it comes to this but I cannot stand being referred to as a client and particularly dislike ""consumer"". I am really curious to see what other people's thoughts are when it comes to those two terms.

Your developers need to see how what they do impacts users. They need to see, from a website functional perspective -- does it meet the needs of the end user. When I've been on web teams, we tested functionality by using and, actually, trying to break the website. :) We would use it from the perspective of different user groups, based upon business analysis. (Publishers of content have different requirements than searchers/readers. Professionals have different needs than the general public. Treat this as one more user group in your website testing.   
Everyone else is posting excellent examples of how you can simulate different disabilities, but I wanted to assure you that you are not stepping on toes in this instance.   


Put the screen too far away, for blurry vision use smears of butter on a screen filter  for example.   
Have them use a screen reader. Use both an app for desktop and laptop computers. Have them \*also\* use the integrated screen reader that is in most modern cell phones. Many people with vision impairments use screen readers and website's navigation can really break down. Screen readers also benefit those with reading and vision processing disorders. It is also a way to understand how the alt tags for graphics and pictures work.

Have them use voice input.  
Forcing them to use voice input to navigate will help simulate the more severe hand mobility issues. When I worked with students in community college with severe reading disabilities -- they used both voice input and output.  
Have them use a keyboard only to navigate and \*interact\* with your site will help simulate both users with vision impairment and those with hand mobility/coordination issues.   


I'm not sure what to simulate to get them to understand why navigation and directions need to be simple, direct and clear. There are a variety of learning disabilities that benefit from this. But, it really benefits all of your users. 

Frankly, they don't even necessarily need to know the details -- just that different user groups are using different input and output devices. Put together the same kind of business analysis report you do with any user group.   


You might also benefit from running user studies with users that regularly use alternative ways to interact with your website. That way you can see how experienced users function on your website. Your developers may not be aware of all of the features within a screen reader for example. Those with vision loss can listen at faster than average speed for example. I would be curious to know if your website slows down their flow.

Freshmen had to live in one of three dorm sets. There were private rooms offered in these, but I was given “first choice” of rooms to guarantee my needs were met. For the upperclassmen years, housing choices were done based on a lottery system using points, but I was allowed to choose before the lottery took place. So there were only 3 female private rooms with private bathrooms on campus, but I was guaranteed one by not having to go through the lottery system. I definitely think you are within your rights to request a private room, but you might need more reasons than just the space (they might have a few rooms available that are larger than standard - my dorms did). You could probably get a doctor to support a private room by stating you need to have the ability to nap in a quiet environment when exhausted and that you require more sleep than your peers as well as access to privacy for your medical care and the ability to limit germs in your living environment to prevent illness. You will want to reach out to housing as soon as you accept at a college and make an accommodation request. At my college, housing was handled separately than all other accommodations. Oh, and if you need accommodations for dietary reasons that was separate too (like we were not normally allowed to take food out of the cafeteria, but I had a pass that allowed me to carry out meals back to my dorm room when I did not feel well but still wanted a meal; for food allergies they can or must provide ingredient lists if requested).",,,1,0,0,

While I can't say my disability has played much of a part in the opinion I've had about jobs in the past, I've been where you are--technically, am there. It's a decent job, but I'm definitely not as enthusiastic about it as I was a couple years ago. I know exactly why that is in my case, and am looking for a job that will help me solve that problem--decent job, but pay sucks out loud and advancement prospects are minimal.

I'm not going to play armchair counsellor here or anything, but I wouldn't be surprised if the way you're feeling has more to do with your previous job than your disability. I'm not saying it does, I'm not saying it doesn't, but even if you were 100% confident your disability has absolutely nothing to do with it, the environment you were in prior to the job you have now is... eh... let's just call it not good and leave it at that. That would wear anyone down, disabled or not. I don't know how long you put up with it before leaving that job, but it's very possible you might just need time.

They gave his parking pot to her and his argument was, ""is she going to slip and fall in her w/c trying to go the further distance? NO, but my chance of falls goes up with walking with my cane through the slush and ice. 

For those that don't know, cane tips freeze up in snow and slush and become almost dangerous in and of themselves as the slither. My entryway has marble tiles and when I walk in during the winter, yikes! Sorry off topic.

What is that movie that they were watching in Sleepless in Seattle when the woman had been hit by a car and that is why she couldn't meet the guy at the top of the Empire State Building on Valentine's Day? She was in a w/c. Lots of old shows I saw them often like on Perry Mason, but most of them turned out to be able to walk and were the culprit!

the time period until the first appeal is typically just a few months, so if you were able to do the immigration stuff i bet you could handle this too if you wanted. then one of the lawyers you talked to could take over for the multiple years part.

06cc45e0-1880-4f9c-9c76-8cd1d9866a92,1561551620,"A bit late to the party, but I’ve had ME/CFS for a bit over 5 years and have experience at both the mild and the moderate (mostly housebound the last 3.5 years) level of the illness. Apologies in advance for how long this got!

There can be so much grief in a situation like ours. It’s normal. It’s not wrong to be grieving, and to call it grieving. Many people won’t understand the legitimacy of this grieving process, but they don’t matter here— you do. 

Imagine a ball inside a box. Inside the box is also a “grief button”. At first, the box is small and that ball is pressing that button all the time. It feels awful and terrible and you’ve got the why-mes all day long. Feel those feelings as much as you need to, but also try to move towards other feelings. As time goes by, the box starts to get bigger, so that there are moments when the ball isn’t pushing the grief button. The box keeps getting bigger over time, and eventually you’ll have more hours, days or even weeks in a row where the ball isn’t constantly mashing the grief button. For me, seeing someone run by is a-ok some days, and other days it sends the ball straight to the grief button. Knowing  how normal that is has been really helpful for me. 

The most important ME/CFS-specific advice I can give is to try and learn to put your health first as much as you possibly can. If you’re trying to figure out if you have enough energy for something, or think maybe you shouldn’t do something— don’t do it! There’s gotta be energy left for processing everything that’s happening to you. 

A close second priority should be things you enjoy, things that are fun— I know the illness takes a lot of that, but whatever you have left that makes your life a little more enjoyable, make sure you prioritize it. It’s really really important to our overall well-being to try and do this. You might need to find new “bed friendly” hobbies, and this can take time, but don’t get discouraged. Everything takes more time with ME, even just coming up with a new thing you might like to try. 

It was a few years into being sick before I heard from any “medical” people that resting and having fun if possible were the best things I could do for myself, and I really wish I’d had this knowledge sooner, instead of feeling like I should keep working and cooking and cleaning until my body literally gave up.",,,6,0,0,

I'm not sure how things work over there, but it looks like her mother is not the person who actually makes decisions. It looks like the pregnant woman is in the care of the state - so the state is making the decisions. That is why the (grand) mother's offer to help raise the baby is not weighed into the decision.  


If someone is unable to make other medical decisions for themselves, at what point do we say that they can make \*this\* decision for themselves? It is always a very grey area when you get into those with cognitive disabilities. I mean if you are dealing with someone who is only at the level of an infant to preschooler then you know that pregnancy and birth would be traumatizing for them. But, when you start getting into those who are able to make basic day to day decisions, function in basic day to day tasks and communicate, it is harder to know where that line is.",,,10,0,0,

I say this partly because I am a singer, but I also think it’s a good place to meet people in general, and is relatively low stress on the body (I have never experienced problems when I tell directors that I need to sit down more than usual). (Although, community choirs tend to trend older in age, but I’ve still sung with a good amount of people in their 20s-40s, so it just depends). 

But yeah in general, do a hobby, and there are lots of hobbies that are very accessible for all sorts of disabilities. Book clubs, knitting, pottery/art, meditation, etc. 

Also I will say, if you’re religiously inclined, church/temple/synagogue/whatever can also be a good place to meet people, and they’re kind of spiritually obligated not to be judged (YMMV)",,,5,0,0,

I like the story here of what I can gather, however the main character is extremely flat and unbelievable. The idea of finding out you're not a real person would be world shattering. There would be no way her reaction would be so little. I don't think it'd be frantic more like shock and denial. She makes a decision and walks out before anyone would even be able to really process the situation. (Maybe this is due to time constraints I don't know) Then at the end her saying she's in with a smile. Just would never happen no matter who it happened to. Also, which it seems odd, the subtle movements of the other girl(you) are realistic but it doesn't feel real. Hard to explain. I guess just more subtlety would go a long way. The sarcastic humor is great but seems forced, and the eye roll seemed too forced. Anyway that's my weigh in. Not saying you're a bad actor at all, much better than I would ever do. I'm assuming you're relatively new to this considering  you're in college ( I saw your other post with the leg guy and someone commented about this being at MIT ) and also I'm only commenting on you because you posted this. Just an outside perspective from someone who loves movies and tv much more than the average person. I also know alot of making movies look 'real' is cinematography which I imagine is hard to do very well on a low budget. But maybe more close in cuts on the face instead of filming the whole room. Makes it more personal and less of a home movie look, the scene of you two talking to her just looked like someone filmed it in a home made video, just no camera movement or cuts to faces ect. Is this just a short film or is there more to it? You probably don't even care much about my comments on one tiny short film that may not even be a big deal but that's my input.

Also I reread this and it all seems dickish and negative I only stated the stuff I saw that could have improvement. I didn't say anything I liked about it because you know..constructive criticism.",,,1,0,0,

What most disability folks would argue is that, while Keller and Girma are both fascinating and compelling figures, it is social barriers that prevent most people with disabilities from achieving the same level of esteem. Rather than focusing on a personal narrative of “overcoming through hard work”, the important question would be, “What social constructs are standing in the way of people with disabilities that lead people to regard only a select few as remarkable?”

I’m not sure whether that’s exactly what you meant to imply, but it is such a pervasive stereotype about people with disabilities, that many of us are particularly sensitive to even the appearance of its traces...

She will need some updated medical records and they will send out some letters to her doctors. 

I would see if you can talk to your local county office and get her on Medicaid. There is sometimes a waiver for interim disabled people who are waiting for SSI/SSDI cases to be approved. I was on that for two years while I waited for my case to be approved.

We don't fall under the equal rights act, as it currently stands (it protects from discrimination by gender, race, religion). (this is an International site, I can only speak to the US). That is why it is important to get such legislation in the works and/or ensure we are included on the Equality act along with race, religion, gender, sexual orientation and gender identity (which is still in legislation). There is a bill currently to do with ensuring independence for disabled people - I'm not sure how that would impact things. The Americans with Disabilities Act is limited in authority and you have to actually have experienced the discrimination to bring a case before a board and it is not grounds for a lawsuit like other discrimination cases are. The ADA is also constantly being chipped away at and undermined -- unfortunately it is consistently a Republican legislation and conservative rulings that do so.  The way it is intepreted now, the gentleman that first developed the Act (which did cover himself) is ironically, tragically, no longer covered under the ADA (If treatment renders you ""non disabled"" you are not covered. For example if you have a disability that is stabilized with medication and that medication does not need special storage or leeway so you can take it - you are not covered) That being said, I think they would have trouble justifying extra requirements that they don't have for other parents -- such as a driver's license.

1. Is this a service dog for a disability?
2. What task have they been trained to perform?

They cannot ask what disability a customer has, and they can't ask that the dog demonstrate their task. 

However, if a dog is badly behaved, the patron *can* be asked to leave, whether it's a ""real"" service dog or not. Misbehavior is anything from sniffing merchandise and approaching other customers, like you described (service dogs should heel at their handler's side), to having accidents or becoming aggressive. Normal shedding, other people not liking dogs, or allergies do not count as misbehaving.

In your situation, you could point out the dog to a manager. A lot of people just don't know the ADA guidelines and are too scared to do anything (or if they have a chip on their shoulder about dogs and/or disabilities, overstep their capabilities and get their businesses in legal trouble).

This makes me rage, I love the phrase ""person with disabilities"" because to me it sounds more inclusive of disabilities as a wide and varied range of issues.

Back when I was a full time crutches user I was comfortable telling people ""I'm a disabled person"" or ""I have *a* disability"" because there was this visual representation of one of my biggest limitations (mobility) and people didn't question it. 

But now that I'm doing well with PT, my issues are almost all invisible, and I am ""able-passing"" (a term which in itself is problematic, but it's a social situation that exists and needs to be talked about) if I say ""I have a disability"" or ""I'm disabled"" it always leads to questions or statements about how I'm ""not *that* disabled"" (uh, thanks, but I didn't quantify my level of disability, I merely disclosed that I had one) 

So now I'm more likely to say ""I identity as person with disabilities"" because for me, it's not just one thing that I struggle with, how my singular medical condition effects me results in multiple disabilities (when you define disability as a dysfunctional ability to carry out a task), and my issues are of varying levels of interference on my life.

To me, the word ""disabled"" sounds ultimate, you either can or can't, but ""person with disabilities"" sounds like it describes the true spectrum that is disability, sometimes I can and sometimes I can't, I have disabilities, but right now I am might not be disabled.",,,2,0,0,

Clinical applications of stem cells are in their very early stages (lab work and some clinical trials), but that hasn't stopped a lot of unscrupulous people from running ahead of the science and offering treatments now.

I know I had to make due with a computer chair for a while before my wheelchair arrived.

There's a lot of features in a wheelchair friendly apartment that help. 

Electric outlets are higher up on the wall, light switches lowered, my front door is remote controlled, the hallways are wider. 

I also have a lot of grab bars around the toilet and the bathroom door slides like a closet door instead of opening plus the sink is lower while also having space underneath to get my wheelchair/legs underneath it so I'm close enough.

The kitchen I think is my favourite. The sink has no cabinets underneath so I can park my chair and do the dishes. My stovetop and oven are separated, with the stovetop being like the sink in that I can roll up to it and fit my legs underneath. The oven is actually in the wall at (for someone who is standing) torso level and opens like a microwave. It has pull-out cutting boards/countertops in the wall underneath it so I can slide things from the oven rack onto them and not get burned or have to put hot things in my lap.

Unfortunately these would be really expensive modifications to do on your own to a standard apartment.

But essentially you just want to prevent falls and maximize his independence.",,,2,0,0,

the way the ada works is that they don't have to give you the accommodation you want, but they can't refuse to give accommodations at all because they ""aren't fair"" and they can't give you an accommodation you don't agree is an accommodation. if they still refuse, you would not be out of place contacting a lawyer or reporting them to the equal employment opportunity commission.

reporting to the eeoc sounds really foreboding and is in fact a requirement to sue them, but the first step they will do is assign a mediator to see if they can work out something that works for everyone. even if you never intend to sue, it's still a good option to get a neutral party into the picture and if the employer fires you in response to you doing the report it looks really bad. the mediator doesn't cost the business anything either.

I saw a quote when I was younger (pre disability) that said ""I love thunderstorms. The hiss of the wind, the boom of the thunder, the lightning that lights up the sky. Why? Because of the chaos. Because sometimes in this boring, scheduled life, this waiting-for-friday-night life that we all lead, we just need the world to remind us that not everything is perfect. Sometimes nature can't handle the pressure. Sometimes the sky explodes. ""

Now that I'm older and disabled, I like to take out the waiting-for-Friday-night part and it speaks to me as a metaphor for disability. (my disability specifically, where my body gets overwhelmed then overcompensates on repeat until I just passout and reset) my body can't handle the chaos and sometimes that turns into an episode of pseudobulbar affect or something else uncontrollable. 

I think that taking something scary and destructive and flipping it to be beautiful can have a calming effect.
