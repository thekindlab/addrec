However, you might consider determining if there are potential accommodations that might help you in the classroom.  Good written communication skills are a valuable commodity in the workplace, so there are a lot of options for you.  My undergraduate degree is in Professional and Technical Communication (switched to that after abandoning English secondary education).  Worked as a grant writer and project manager for a few years and then transitioned to public safety management.  I used my writing skills extensively in both.  

There are also a lot of legitimate work from home jobs.  You might contact the Department for Vocational Rehabilitation to see if they can point you in the right direction.  Good luck!",,,2,0,0,

Honestly I would probably try to sue them if they tried enforce it. I mean of all people, I would almost say we need to work out the most. I can't tell you how extremely freeing it was to realize that I had attained a level of strength that would allow me to put myself back in my wheelchair if and when I fell out. before that there was always a shadow of fear any time I went anywhere by myself. It was small and it never really stopped me from doing to much, but there was always the knowledge that if something bad happened I may just be screwed. Because I was simply too weak if worst happened I would just have to lay there.
They probably do this because they're afraid of getting sued if someone falls off a machine and gets injured. That's life tho, you have to take risks if you want rewards. We all know that's going in. I've fallen several times at my gym. it just made me want to be stronger even more.

Unfortunately, these are also where the baby changing station is. As someone that needs an accessible toilet and in the past has used no aids and has dealt with a bitchy mother. I would recommend getting a RADAR key and accessing the locked toilet for the disabled.

With your own key the explaining isn't neccessary and if you sometimes require a larger stall even though you don't look disabled you still are disabled so just use what you need, when you need it.

I do the same with accessible parking. I am disabled, I have a placard and the right to use a reserved spot though I do not use one 100% of the time. If there is an equally close spot or one that is closer I use it and leave the others for someone that needs the extra space more.",,,2,0,0,

Does the base detach? 

What type of chair do you have, do you wheelie up and down kerbs in it independently? Will there be steep ramps at the convention that you use alone? That's when I could see a typical clip attachment being a problem, if the quad base is too close to the ground when it tucks under your backrest it'll hit the ground when you tip. Turning it upside down is just going to smack you in the back/neck/head. Specific quad cane holders exist but I've only seen them for electric chairs where tipping isn't an issue. 

If you push on the flat and have your husband tip you up and down you'd be fine as he can watch for the quad base when you tip. He could carry the cane for you. If suitable for short distances you could consider a plain straight cane with another cane/your husband for stability. 

You could ask to leave it at reception, though they would also need to be willing to take your chair and keep it safe when you're using the cane. Depends on how willing you are to leave your chair somewhere. If you need *a* chair rather than *your* chair specifically the centre may provide manuals that you can borrow while they keep your cane safe.

I still disagree with you and some of the other comments because I beleive you're  wrong and being rude and when we feel that way ...we should not be worried to say that. The fear of the  mob downvoting or upvoting etc or another person or their misguided friend  or shill (sadly a thing we see more and more) intervening and causing a chaos loop totally unrelated to the topic.  

That's what you're doing intentionally or otherwise and I'm sad to see this increasingly common social media  issue alive and well on this forum. 

As it's toxic and we see the concequences particularly on children and vulnerable adults daily as a increasing number of people with 'disability' and mental health turn to the internet as a safe haven or retreat... only to find it is a torturous trap and a posion prison.  

Systems set up to help are used to abuse as seen here and demonstrated on reddit through the voting system and , as exposed in 2016 and again yesterday (see front page) the use of shill accounts and corrupted content to promote one story or voice above all others.

The latter is exactly what I and organisations have fought (as it is a battle and a war) for years in government and public consciousness in the West.  But the internet is a new battle ground with new rules and it's a worse issue than ever.  The digital discrimination.  Same old bs but in new far more insidious guises.  

Many new ways to tell someone that they are wrong and less than you and their opinion doesn't matter...when the internet was formed on the opposite ideologies and philosophy.

None of this is related to the topic which  is my point and complaint.  

The perfectly valid discourse has been muddied by one user and then yourself by one challenging someones requested opinion and the other believing they needed an advocate.  As a real world advocate we ask the individual first before presuming they aren't strong enough to defend their own actions and weighing in as that can cause far more damage and problems than the original issue.  As arguably being demonstrated here.

An OP asking a community each individuals opinion.  Not asking a community to argue amongst themselves and passively and overtly attempt to censor opinion through the broken system.  That occurred and then some felt the need to criticise or comment individuals opinions. That's a problem as that wasn't the object of the op and if done in a hostile way, 'perceived or actual' , it causes people to stop joining in.  That's a problem for me.  And though you might disagree...I believe  everyone has a right to be heard without censor or fear of the mob.

This is an issue we see all the time in my work and if you yourself have any experience with what we're calling disability, then you'll know first hand how damaging such abuses of the system can be when bullying, harassing , and the downvote system is employed.  

We, I consider the downvote system to be part of that negative cycle when the upvotes system is enough.  The downvote is to shame and blame and victimised and discrimate and crap on people for speaking their mind.  An opinion which might not be popular but not necessarily wrong.  I don't need to be popular but I'm not wrong and if I was I still would not support the tactics of the mob.

I was banned from the Donald by mods for promoting nuclear warfare (lol) because I challenged their world ideologies in a polite and civil manner. I asked them to think about the victims of a totalitarian regime. 

Rather than accept my small but valid voice in a sea of many... they felt the need to silence it with downvotes and censorship.  Just as has been done to people with disability since time immortal.

That is the worst possible outcome of free speech. Censorship.  Downvoting is a form of that censorship.  Shouting a voice down until it goes silent which is the opposite of what I spend my days doing.  As is the constant muddying of the discourse when a request is made and answered and then others weigh in as a mob.

I now see it was **my bad** to even respond to the original person who questioned our experiences with our clients / guests.  

By following my own standards I should have ignored any request other than the op, as I was answering the op and not a crowd or a mob or anyone else.  My bad.

But though I support your right to disagree and make claims I disagree with and I'd like to say 'abuse' but as the system is broken ill say ' utilize' the system to sway me (6 to -4 Will do that haha)  I'm only willing to speak to you further via pm.  
As I already said and you ignored.

I won't be part of turning a valid question post to an opportunity for diminishing others opinions. I've already don't that haha
If I've done that , that is my mistake , as much as everyone who felt the need to comment on my opinion to the op.

This post was a question asked and a response given.  Anything after that is distracting from the intended discourse.  And I don't wish to contribute to that further... as it was never my intention and already I have strayed from my own rules.

I thank you or anyone though who expressed their view.  Though I would strongly advise doing so without the negative downvote and intervening in another's conversation or even challenging an opinion on a question thread just because it doesn't fit your world view.  But now I'm trying to 'fix' the internet , as well as the world haha (what's new! ;).

I can confidently say that you are not alone, a lot of chair users reading this are nodding along going 'I know those feels'. Every single permanent chair user I know, be it through degenerative disease, acute illness or injury, has felt like this. Every single one of us, even the ones who are years out from onset or injury, still have that day when you roll through dog shit or the lift is broken or someone makes a shitty comment and it's all bollocks again. But at that point it's just a bad day, and everyone on the planet has those. One day feeling how you feel will simply be a bad day rather than a bad life. 

-----------------

First things first. If your doctor says you should use a wheelchair, use the damn wheelchair. Get them to write you a prescription for a nice active user which is lightweight and fits like a glove. This makes every bit of difference, you're no longer stuck with clunky folding chairs that weigh a ton and don't manouver. Get it in a colour you like and personalise that fucker. I see my chair as a more important car, I want it to get me from A to B but I also want it to look nice and feel good to sit in. You don't have to drop your crutches, you can get a holder and stick them on the back of your chair in case you need them. Use a bit of both if you want to, it opens up access. But please listen to your doctor if they have told you to use a chair.

It will depend on your level of physical ability but if you can use crutches I'd assume you can build good upper body strength which gives you all the options. In my chair with intermediate strength I can kerb hop up and down several inches, turn in a tight circle, go up and down steep hills, bump over obstacles and potholes, go over grass and gravel, go up steps, down steps, turn in a wheelie. With my off road adaptations I can go through woods, thick mud and damp sand. The only surfaces I can't do without help are very loose, powdery sand, boggy mud and steep or rocky paths like mountains. 

After physical limitations wheelchair use is all about practice and learning new skills, you get out what you put in. Learn the skills and it opens up a lot of options for you. Cliches and all that but it does get better with time. How far out are you from injury? Relearning a whole new way to move and live is challenging and overwhelming, especially as an adult. It's fucking irritating and to begin with everything is *so slow*. You're doing bits of childhood all over again to learn new ways to do things and that's infuriating. But again the more you do it, the more you learn what suits and the faster you get.

-----------

Regarding adventure. I don't know your disability and your physical abilities, if you're comfortable sharing them people will be able to give more tailored advice. But so, so many adventure activities are doable from a chair. I've been freediving (sadly no SCUBA...yet). Hike and camp regularly with my offroad wheels, just need to choose lower paths. Adapted sailing has some incredible groups. And so many chair users travel internationally both on and off the beaten track.

I can add climbing, abseiling, horse riding, skating, kayaking, archery, zip lines and more standard sport to my list. I know other chair users who go skiing, mountain biking (handcycle), surfing, rowing, sledding, canoing. There are many conventional sports like swimming, athletics, weightlifting, badminton, basketball, tennis, rugby, curling, racing, dance, golf, various martial arts. I'm sure I've missed a lot more. There is a *lot* of stuff out there adaptable for people with a disability, especially if you have high upper body function.   

There is no reason you should have to give up an active, adventuring lifestyle. You may have to swap for a different activity or agree to adaptations but short of an illness that keeps you housebound or causes serious cardiovascular/respiratory issues, there will be some way round it. 

A lot of it is about confidence which you will build as you learn your new capabilities. You learn how far you can push it, what your limits are physically and mentally. How to recover if you push it a bit too far. This morning I overestimated my kerb hop ability and fell out of my chair. I stuck a finger up at the kerb and got back in. When it was new that was literally my worst nightmare, I woke up sweating dreaming I'd be stuck on the pavement somewhere. I was too scared to leave the house in case I came up across a surface I couldn't push over or a fall I couldn't get up from. Now I really do not give a hoot and only consider it when hiking. 

-----------

Your vocation is a truly shitty one and I'm really hurting for you there. If there was a way to stay within your field would you want to do it, or would you prefer to move to something else altogether? Sometimes it's possible to move to an advisory or support role in a career where you can't manage the physical aspects, or do some minor retraining to work in an associated role. It really depends on the job but look into it, sometimes it's an option you wouldn't expect. 

---------------

And finally. See a therapist if at all possible. This is a huge life change and your brain is going to be a prick about it for the near future. Talk to other people with similar disabilities, we get it, we'll empathise/rage together and share practical tips. Keep your friends close, and let them know what they can do to help. Want to go to a more accessible bar? Too tired and fancy a pizza, six pack the football at home? Fancy a trip with company? Let them know. Tell them what you can manage at that time. If it changes? Let them know. You don't need to give out the ins and outs of your health if you don't want to but keep them in the loop with your abilities. Tell them those abilities will change, sometimes with short notice, but that you still want to DO ALL THE THINGS. Just maybe at a later date. 
 
It's okay to be angry and imagine torching every Honda dealership in the universe while simultaneously stabbing that jackass with a steel pineapple. When someone is a dick about my chair I imagine ripping off the backbar, Hulk-style, and hamstringing them with it. It's normal and okay to be frustrated and sad. You're allowed to grieve for the life you lost.

What's not okay is letting those feelings take over your life and push away the people who love you. Don't shut yourself off from the world and the things you enjoy, find a way to put them into now. It's tempting to hide away because it's just so much new to deal with. But it never, ever helps. Keep pushing yourself out to do things and always ask for support if you need it. People who love you want to know how they can help but they might not know how, what or when to ask.",,,2,0,0,

I am not sure the nature of your disability, but I have mobility issues with both arms that require lots of surgery and recovery time. I'm a writer by trade and own my own business and nonprofit that works with agricultural and educational groups. My two friends and I are a triumvirate of computer programmer, scientist, and writer. I should also note that my disability status is under review with the US government. 

Pros: 

* Pick my own hours and work as much as I can
* Able to schedule doctor's appointments when I need them without having to worry about scheduling time off
* Take days off when I need to
* Pick my clients (especially helpful to work with clients that understand the nature of my disability and will work with me on their schedule). 
* At times, less stress do to the above points

Cons:

* Sometimes my disability makes it so I can't work and time = money, especially when working with yourself. 
* More stress because if I have a project I need to get done, I sometimes have to push through pain to get things done
* Taxes. Self-employment taxes (depending on your country) can be a major pain in the butt. Luckily, I have a fantastic accountant and have patience when talking directly with the IRS.
* Insurance -- you mentioned going on Medicaid which would be a good option. However, I think the IRS has some rules about making a certain amount of money while disabled. It sucks because you can't make ""too much"" money and thus it's hard to budget!
* Working by yourself. Working for oneself is very rewarding but it can also be devastatingly difficult. You'll need to think about things like marketing, advertisements, bookkeeping, taxes, budgets, banking, and a million other tiny little details that are required to run a small business!

My friend Bert went from doing motocross to being completely paralyzed from his chest down. He also once was in a coma for 2 years and has had to relearn everything. Its been 15 years since his accident. He says he uses his injury as a life lesson. He could have died and not been alive at all; never being able to love or see his niece get born or go to concerts. Sure he hurts and things are never going to be the same as before, but he tries to always look on the bright side of life. That's not saying he doesn't have bad days and days of frustration. Everyone does. It's normal to feel that way. But don't label yourself a failure. I, too, am slowly wearing away. I'm trying to live life, but my body is my own worst enemy. I try to take it easy. I've been writing in a journal, talking on forums, and discussing things with people to keep myself sane. Sure things won't ever be the same, but all I can think of is my loved ones and the future I can have and all the things I want to see and do. Sure I won't be able to do some things, but having dreams helps you to live on. 

You may not be able to do your career anymore, but that doesn't mean it was a waste. I'm still paying off my school loans for culinary school. I experienced so many things, both good and bad, in my time through culinary school. I used to hate on myself after my body started failing and I needed surgery on my arms and now I've lost so much usage that I can't do much else from packaging stuff and working part time. I used to label myself a failure. I felt dumb for wasting my time learning something I can no longer use. But then I realized that I gained life experience. I got to do things that not everyone gets to do. I have a lot of amazing stories to share. I have skills I can still use in different ways. I watch food Network and apply my knowledge to what I see. I help others cook and learn about food. I've even convinced people to learn to cook. Despite not being a chef, it was worth it in the long run. Whatever it is you did, definitely don't feel bad about not being able to do it now. In fact, try to think of the positives like I did. I mostly only regret the student loans since I'm becoming more and more disabled every day. However, as for a career; just cause you can't do what you trained for and used to do, doesn't mean you can't find something similar or something you'll love to do as much. I work as a clerk in a bakery; the closest thing to a chef as I can get with my issues. I have lots of fun helping make people happy and helping my team despite my issues. 

As for being injured by someone else's stupidity, you have my sympathies. I may not have wound up in the same situation as you, but I have some crappy stuff to deal with thanks to Jimmy John's. I fell at their restaurant because someone spilled water and didn't clean it up, causing me to knock out my front teeth, bang up my knees (hurting my meniscuses), fractured my right arm (which was disabled and had cost a lot to fix) and pulled my left arm out of place (which I had just had surgery on). All of this caused me to panic and they then had the nerve to make me walk to the hospital. Needless to say, I had to fight them in court for 2 years just to get the bare minimum treatment and then I still am not fixed. I can't eat much anymore thanks to my dead front teeth. My arms tire easily and now my knees are having trouble functioning properly. I still can't forgive them. I hope Karma bites them in the ass. I hope karma comes for the person who hurt you. It's not fair to be hurt due to the stupidity of others. I really hope you keep up the fight. Don't let them injuring you stop you from living life. My life has changed, but I just see it as another hurdle to make me stronger. Don't give up. If you do, you're letting them win. I constantly try to put Jimmy John's in their place and let them know that I will still live a full life even though they hurt me. 

At the end of the day, I know that you can't change the body you're in, but you can still try to enjoy life and those around you. Try to just think of the fact that you're alive. You can still enjoy and experience life. The world is getting better at being accessible for others. Do your best to still see the world. Talk to others, enjoy hobbies even if you have to change how you do them, etc. Your body may be failing you, but your brain is still there. Use it to your advantage. Help others out by using your education/career training to teach them. Think of people like Stephen Hawking and my friend Berto and let them be role models for you and give you the courage and inspiration you need to live on. It takes time to get used to your disability. I'm 30 and have been fighting to move since I was 12. You're always going to hate on yourself, and that's normal. Life is full of ups and downs, but that doesn't mean you can't try to make the best of life. I wish you the best of luck and hope you will fight for your future. 

Whenever I feel down, I think of these things to motivate myself to keep going:
*Loved ones such as family, friends, partners, etc. 
*Pets and animals
*Hobbies such as art and video games and writing
*Traveling this vast world 
*Meeting new people and learning new things
*Think of the people who have it worse than yourself and can't do everything you can do",,,1,0,0,

c52d51b9-5c84-421d-93a7-69936ae578f9,1554451217,"Here is some information about the CDR process and your options.

After your case is assigned to to a disability examiner at the state disability determination agency, you will probably get a letter or request for information from the state disability determination agency. It can take 2-4 months (more or less) for a CDR to be assigned. 

If you have a doctor who you have seen on numerous occasions and is available to provide additional information about your conditions and work related limitations, that is generally very helpful. As long as your doctor’s assessment is generally consistent with their treatment notes and other evidence, SSA should give your doctor’s opinion significant consideration. After your case is assigned to a disability examiner, you can request that they send you a form or questionnaire for your doctor to fill out.

After the state disability determination agency make a medical decision, you will receive written notice of a decision. 

If your CDR is denied, you can appeal the decision within 60 days. If you appeal the denial promptly (within 10 days of receiving it) you should have the option to elect to receive continuing benefits pending your appeal. 

If you receive continuing benefits pending an appeal, but SSA ultimately determines that you are no longer disabled, if your case is denied after appeals, and you get an overpayment, you can request that they waive this overpayment and by their rules as long as you requested continuing benefits in good faith (believing that you are still disabled) and complied with the appeal process (responded to requests for information, attended scheduled appointments and hearings), SSA should generally waive this type of overpayment.

Best wishes!",,,6,0,0,

Quick questions - might have been covered in other comments already. If so, apologies. I scanned through but didn't see them. 

1. Do you have a diagnosis though? Doctors...yeah. Doctors be doctors. Time efficiency and not much emotional affect, overall. �� But if you've got a term for what you've got, and you know your needed accommodations (even if you don't need them *all the time*, you still need them)...
2. What type of representation do you have at your place of employment? What's the HR departments comfort level with things like the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act, if you're in the US)? 

I hear you 100%. It's fucking *exhausting* trying to deal with other's expectations and ideas about who you are and what you're capable of. I try my best to give 0 fucks, but it's the same as everything else. Sometimes I'm better at it than others. �� I'm glad you do have a few people who you know you can count on and tell your full story too. �� That makes a ton of difference. Do your best mitigating the rest of the world (I don't remember which other commentator said it - people suck no matter what. Lol. That's a good sentiment), but it's *okay* to focus in sometimes on the few who will sit and listen to your full story. Thanks for including this community in on it. ��

We know from recent leaks on the surveillance programs PRISM and FIVE-EYES that our government has been working to get backdoors in social media platforms for years. There is a huge amount of data and information on that if you just google it.

However, they’ve recently become far more brazen. Facebook provided access to them at some level, but then Facebook developed Facebook Messenger, which they *encrypted*. That made it the only aspect of FB the government couldn’t access. Last summer, our government began to threaten Facebook if they refused to provide a [backdoor to Messenger](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-messenger-wiretap-backdoor-2018-8), which will likely be shared with the FIVE-EYES nations.

I know that sounds super tin-foil hat, but both PRISM and FIVE-EYES are now public information, and the requests regarding backdoors are no longer secret. This isn’t a “read between the lines” thing, it’s explicitly spelled out in [government documents](https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/prism-slides-nsa-document) — even if those documents look like a bad cross between 1990’s web design and 1990’s PowerPoint aesthetic.",,,4,0,0,

First off, keeping disabled stalls locked sounds incredibly discriminatory. I would say definitely yes, because disabled people shouldn't have to wait for a toilet/find someone to allow them to use it. If you're worried about it just make sure if there is a mother/baby you let them go first and if someone were to confront you explain you are disabled and it was an emergency and you couldn't wait to find someone to unlock the disabled toilet.

I know some don't agree but if there isn't any handicap parking available and there is mother of small children parking, I'll park there and put up my placard. It's often dangerous for me to walk long distances outdoors so the store isn't accessible to me without close parking.",,,2,0,0,

I don't think there's a single day since chairception I've been out in public alone amongst strangers and not had a disability related comment. With friends or family, around areas where I know people, sure. But put me in a new place with strangers where interaction happens and inevitably some comment about my chair or health will come up. It's really old now and it will probably never stop. I want to forget about my health and live my life, but other people won't let me while they can see it.

There is a full shovel of shit even if you are a fully independent person who lives and copes alone. It doesn't take needing full time care to make a visible illness difficult. And unless you count 'too sick to get out of bed' as visible, there are plenty of invisible illnesses that require full time care too. 

I'm not saying this to be a cunt. I'm saying it to give you a fresh look. It's not any easier over on this side of the grass, don't kid yourself that it is. Losing friends, keeping a job, pinning down a diagnosis are all things that happen with visible disabilities too. It's not a competition, we have to accept that we're all different, each of us got our own personalised shit sandwich and should support each other where we can. Comparing yourself to someone with a visible disability is as useful as comparing yourself to someone healthy which is as much use as a chocolate teapot.

There will always be 'some people' but you learn to filter them out, or at least the noise they make. You learn to pick friends who respect your limitations, and yes it is an effort. You may have less of them but they're better quality, the internet is great for this as you can build up longstanding friendships even with irregular conversation. Unless you tell them, no-one knows you work from home because you are unwell. If someone calls you lazy for working from home without context, they think everyone who works from home without context is lazy. If you feel your doctors are dismissing your concerns, get a second opinion. If you're not pressing quick enough to record an event, ask if a continuous holter with written diary of events is an option. If it's helpful for your symptoms, get a home security camera and leave it running to have evidence of events. Get a BP monitor and keep a home diary. When your nystagmus or other hard to pin down symptoms occur around a doctor, ask them to note it for you and send that to the person managing your overall care. Building up all these little bits helps give a fuller picture and may show a pattern or progression that is otherwise difficult to see. It's not as ideal as being able to perform for a test but it can help a lot.",,,22,0,0,

Just more shopping and sightseeing) were all wheelchair accessible. Some of the side streets were not and there is cobblestone roads in places but the sidewalks and crosswalks are paved smooth. 

There was also a beach wheelchair rental place so you can wheel right into the ocean or onto the beach. 

Check out Vallarta adventures (I’ll paste the link down below) . They were able to accommodate me and i was even able to swim with seals!! Also lots of hotels are wheelchair accessible and the one I went to even had one of those seats that helps lift someone in and out of the water. 

I know this is just one place but I had a great time there in a wheelchair.

At 2 of them the jobs of my team were very flexible and we allowed flex time, meaning show up between 8 and 10, stay 8.5 hours and leave. No punching in. As long as they were hitting their deadlines and worked 40 hours a week I didn't care if they left early and made up the next day, or took more breaks than agreed in the contract. It's the luxury of that sort of job. 
BUT... It's all shits and giggles until someone decides to abuse the freedom and drags others with them. If the quality of work sucks because they binged to hit the deadline, or they bother and distract others by talking too loud and drag the smell of smoke through the whole office something needs to change. It's common sense and courtesy and it soon became known that I don't extend contracts if that's how you roll. And well, I'm the one who was actually rolling, or on crutches. I was (almost) always lucky to have accommodating employers and managers. My abled friends struggle just as much finding a new job. It's not always because of the wheelchair.

It is easy to think nothing will ever change. I think there are better ways to go about screening fraudsters than social media surveillance.

If the application process is fair and regulated, it should be incredibly hard to be fraudulent in the first place.

There’s nothing wrong with taking some artistic liberties when making a historical fiction movie but a lot of people take those for fact. I especially didn’t like how they tried to portray PT Barnum as a good guy. You know Tom Thumb? The dude that rode on a horse dressed as Napoleon? He actually hired him when he was 4. One of the things he had him do to entertain people was drink beer and smoke cigars. He’s had him start drinking when he was five and smoking cigars when he was seven. Also his first “act“ was an 80 year old blind (and paralyzed) slave woman. He claimed she was 160 years old and said only a autopsy would prove her true age. Then when she died he sold tickets for people to watch her autopsy. It also is disrespectful to Jenny Lind who was actually pretty okay. She donated all the money she made to help make public schools in her home country. There was never any scandal involving her and Barnum. Not even any rumors. The real reason she left was because she didn’t like Barnums greedy advertising tactics.,,,1,0,0,

I've lived in about 7 different apartments in the last 10+ years and only encountered this once.  The reasoning is the convenience of living on the first floor.  It's just way easier for moving, groceries, easy access to your car/garage, taking the dog out, and things like that.  Also, you're on the first floor so in some cases you don't have to worry about certain noises.  In this particular apartment building it was more expensive to live on the first and 3rd floor.  The advantage of the 3rd floor being no one living above you to make noise and vaulted ceilings.  Also, they technically didn't consider it a higher rent for these perks, they called it a discount for those that choose to live on the second floor since they'd have neighbors above and below them potentially causing noise.  

I also once lived in an apartment that actually had units that were specially designed for wheelchair users, and they were oddly enough on the second floor.  The building did have elevators, not sure what the reasoning for the second floor was.  And instead of costing more, these units were actually offered at a discount to wheelchair users.  Wasn't a huge discount, like $50 or $75 a month if I recall right, but not shabby and a surprising thing for an apartment building to have.  They were nice 2 bedroom units in a brand new building.  I ended up renting a 3 bedroom on the first floor as I didn't need the extra wheelchair accommodations, as long as door frames were wide enough.",,,9,0,0,

I still remember [the very first time I saw Itzhak Perlman](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=z3richcoCUI). I was 4, I was eating breakfast watching Sesame Street. I remember screaming for my mom. I remember the exact feeling. I had never seen a disabled adult or anyone else walk with forearm crutches. It was utterly amazing.

Sharing something like this is OK. 

There was recently a video I saw on network news featuring a little girl with a disability, her mother and cashier. I immediately saw the intent, the context. It wasn't inspiration porn. We weren't expected to feel something because this girl was disabled and did something typical people do all of the time. It was more than that. 

That all said, my examples and yours are different than a picture posted on reddit with a misleading title and no backstory or context or humanity.

This post misses the mark. If a parent posted it, or the woman or even the child with context to the meeting I could see it's value as something more than it currently is, I don't even see it as inspiration porn. I see it as nothing more than karma whoring.

&gt;There is a story here, and a value to it that we shouldn't ignore or gloss over.

I need the story. The story is more important than the picture and I think that is important.

*Baby hugs a stranger*. I missed the woman's reaction because I was trying to figure out why it was so important that the baby was mentioned. I watched twice. Maybe that's my fault.

If you have  unearned income, it will reduce the benefit dollar for dollar, after the  first $20. So unearned income of $770 will eliminate one month's  benefit. If you have earned income, the first $65 is ignored. After  that, the benefit is reduced by 50 percent of your earnings. For  example, if you earn $685 in a month, the first $85 is ignored. Then  your benefits are reduced by 50 percent of the remaining $600, to $398.

Based  on this formula, you can earn $1,481 in a month before your SSI  benefits are reduced to zero. This computation is done on a  month-to-month basis, and your benefits are determined strictly by the  amount and type of your income. Once you begin working, substantial  gainful activity has no relevance for SSI benefits.

5d8fcb61-10fc-4404-ad1b-6faea8dcd780,1555020088,"&gt; So basically scam the system.... ???

My primary answer, contrary to what some people advocate here is to **not** scam the system nor should we advise other disabled people to scam the system because if we’re not able to fend for ourselves within the US welfare system, then we’re definitely not going to be able to defend ourselves against criminal charges. 

My secondary answer is that whole university courses are taught to social work and sociology students about the history, ideology, and shortcomings of the US welfare system. It can be brutal.

 It’s biased against married people with life-long disability. You completely lose SSI once your spouse makes more than $1,157/month (less than $14,000–which isn’t much when caring for a disabled person). You lose Medicaid when your spouse makes $16,500/year. Medicaid buy-in for a disabled person with a working spouse caps at $30,000/year. Given the rate with which disabled people use healthcare, private or marketplace insurance may not be affordable or offer good coverage. We never know when congress will renege guaranteed coverage of pre-existing conditions. 

You can have an income of $0/month and be ineligible for ADL assistance simply by having an able-bodied spouse. There is a big income difference between qualifying for home healthcare through Medicaid and being able to afford an ADL aide out of your own money.

I got a letter from my doctor stating that a first floor was medically necessary and wrote a letter with a short explanation and why I felt it qualified as an accommodation quoting the Fair Housing Act (I’m in the US). It was denied :/ They claimed since it was written into the rent that it would be a adjustment that doesn’t fall under the regulations (like I got the pet fee waved for an ESA since they claimed it was separate from rent). Manager even said to me that it’’d be discriminatory to adjust my rent and not the rent of the able bodied people (like bish they can choose what floor they want to be on because they can walk up some stairs). Anyway around it, I think it’s wrong morally but haven’t found any clear answers on if it’s wrong legally.

As I clearly wrote before the inevitable but disappointing downvotes. ' Ask the person in question. Support the person. Listen and hear the person.'
I've heard you and I'll be mindful of that in future.

Many people I meet though, via spending my day as a person with disability supporting others, don't like the term and we support everyone where possible.  

We understand that it's possible to disagree but still accommodate others and find room for everyone and every need.

The op was asking us all a question and i shared my opinion  based on my daily experience with hundreds of people in the requested demographic.  

And it was questioned by someone else entirely , in way I found rude...and then I'm mobbed ...but what's new on reddit haha

I'm ok with that but i still stand by  my original comment based on my experience.  

Don't judge or presume.  

Ask the individual or group.

Listen and hear and implement where possible.

Your friends may even realize what dicks they were eventually and ask you to forgive them. Or they may not; either way, it's about their immaturity more than your disability.

The thing that really hit me from OP's post was how difficult it can be to meet someone when shaking hands is the go-to greeting, which makes it impossible to get to know someone without their disability being sort of a prominent part of the initial meeting. I think humor is probably the best way to deal with this, too; maybe something like, ""Your choice; shake left-handed, or shake my ""good"" hand."" This can show people that they own it and are comfortable with it even while they are aware that others might feel uncomfortable about it.

When my face was paralyzed on one side, I couldn't close or blink that eye so I had to wear an eye patch to keep dust and dirt out and keep it from drying up or getting burned in the sun. I embraced the pirate look just like you did. I may have taken it too far, though; even though I no longer need to wear an eye patch, I still travel around the country and attend pirate-themed events, and I dress like a pirate fairly often. In fact my reddit user profile picture is me dressed as a pirate.

Adapting is so important when we have to deal with our disabilities. Life may never be what we would ideally wish for it to be. But we can adapt and find new ways to make the most of what we have been dealt. It's perfectly normal to feel like we have been cheated sometimes, and there's no harm in vent-complaining once in a while, so long as it doesn't become so habitual that it drives people away or fills our lives with self-pity. I think a positive attitude is important for us to be able to successful adapt.",,,4,0,0,

Calling it inconvenienced kind of understates the impact it has on our lives. Personally, I prefer to reclaim the word disabled and work to destigmatize it and us with it.

Just in material and construction, printing AFOs seems very logical, but I have two concerns: the first being the difficulty around finding a tall enough printer, and the second being finding a design of AFO that is both printable and does what it's supposed to.

Regarding the printer height: printers have a max height they can manage, so if her calf length exceeds that, so the trade is between finding someone with an abnormally tall printer or finding a design that can be made in several parts.

Which brings me on to the design. I'm not personally acquainted with AFOs, but I'm assuming that design makes a big difference in whether they are effective or not. That would probably mean a lot of prototyping or having an existing one to scan and scale up/tweak when she grows out of her current ones.

The governor is going to sign the bill although he is strongly opposed to work requirements, because if he doesn't, Medicaid expansion will end here in June, meaning 96,000 people would lose coverage. That's about 10% of my state's entire population. (Yeah, it's a very small population state.)

The hope is that work requirements will be ruled illegal by Federal courts, [as they recently were in one district](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/03/27/707401647/federal-judge-again-blocks-states-work-requirements-for-medicaid).

These idiots don't care that it costs more money to monitor compliance with work requirements than they'll save in kicking people off Medicaid. I mean, hello, most people on Medicaid are already working. Have they not heard the term ""working poor""? And they also don't care about the fact that Medicaid expansion has benefitted our state massively in economic terms.

The same problem exists with the Idiot in Chief's brilliant idea of monitoring SSI/SSDI recipient's social media. The time to do the monitoring, then to evaluate what's posted against each individual's condition to see if there's an appearance of conflict, then kick the person off benefits, then handle all the appeals of that decision: all that will cost a ton of money, way more than they'll save from booting a few people off the program. I bet it would cost at least 10 times as much as they'd save.

But these monsters don't care - they're perfectly happy to spend obscene amounts of money ruining people's lives. That lines up beautifully with their values.

To be medically eligible for SSDI (SSA’s definition of disability) means unable to perform substantial work due to medical conditions. With some limited exceptions, SSA presumes that earning more than $1220 per month in 2019 means that you are performing substantial work and are thus not medically eligible (disabled under their rules).",,,2,0,0,

&amp;#x200B;

There are a number of factors they look at. As others have mentioned, your income over the years and what you've paid into the system count for something. In addition to that, your disability has to either last more than a year to a lifetime.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest factor that I can tell is whether or not you can continue to do work you are qualified for and earn a certain amount every month. If there are tools available that allow you to do your job with minimal impact to your wrists and arms, they'll consider that. It's all very formulated and by the numbers. I had the aid of a disability attorney, and he made it clear that our personal stories count for very little in the course of this. They look at it as a practical matter. They look at the condition, its impact on your life, and whether or not you can obtain gainful employment despite the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe most disability attorneys work on a contingency basis. I think a good attorney would offer you a consultation and be honest with you about your chances. My guy really knew the systems, down to the judges and how they tend to operate. He was a huge help, and I can't imagine going through that hellish process without him.

Here's the issue...I'm fat. Therefore, people automatically assume I'm just lazy. People who know I had a stroke but don't know my medical history assume I had the stroke because of high blood pressure because I'm fat.

I get disgusted looks and even rude comments.

What they don't know is every disease I have is genetic or not my fault. My blood pressure is on the low end of the average range. My cholesterol is great. I'm fat because my thyroid doesn't work because my immune system killed it so I have an extremely slow metabolism. I have PCOS which causes my body to store fat around my midsection. I have crippling pain from Endometriosis, Fibromyalgia and Adenomyosis. I've also had a continuous migraine for almost 7 years. Often, I have two migraines at once. Frequently, I lose all my strength in one side of my body, am dizzy, and nauseated. I don't actually eat that much, which is just as bad as over eating in some ways. My husband works down in London during the week  (we live in North Wales) and I often don't have the energy to cook so I eat a lot of organic yogurt and plain cheerios.

At my disability hearing, after being rejected (of course) in my initial application, after the vocational expert testified, the judge had a small tirade, asking why the system had rejected my application in the first place. I had been told that I would have a ruling in 2 or 3 weeks. My hearing was on a Monday or Tuesday (don't remember which) and I had my decision letter (in my favor) by that Friday. Got to love a judge who actually reviews the medical info thoroughly and apparently pushes things through. 

Think positive. I know it's cliche, but try to take things one day at a time. Try not to worry about a future that hasn't happened. Try to recognize when you are in a downward mental spiral, and focus on today.

But when school and employment and the general world is just not made for people who can't always participate fully in the same capacity as everyone else, we just get left behind. I'm struggling hard to finish my degree, but my disability is directly affecting that by limiting the time I can spend out of the house. I'm trying to find a job in a meaningful career even slightly related to my degree, but they all require working long days in an office rather than working from home at least part-time. Anything that is remote/work from home is usually some kind of menial, soul-sucking job that hardly pays enough to be worth it.

While it's always appreciated for people to submit their own medical records, it's quite possible the records did not contain something specific that was needed- a diagnosis from a PhD, a specific test, etc.

There's often information in the medical records we can obtain that is NOT in the information available to patients. You don't know what is in your complete medical record, and you don't know what it may imply or say. You don't know what's in your initial file. There's a lot you DON'T KNOW, for someone who thinks she/he knows everything. 

You are accusing /u/e05c6193-ace5-4ebd-8c27-5d5db5e2aa36 of wanting to take your benefits, as if she/he is personally reviewing your claim. She/he has NOTHING to do with your claim, she/he is just trying to give advice. We get NOTHING for posting on this subreddit. There's no benefit to us.

Also, if the initial examiner really thought you were going to get better, they would have given you a 12 month or 18 month diary. A 3 year diary is standard. It is the policy set by Social Security, not by Disability. We don't write the award letter. It is language that is automatically generated when a decision is made. 

We have to follow the rules set by Social Security. It's not a choice for us. We CAN get fired for making wrong decisions. Our livelihoods ARE on the hook. 

We don't look at a claim thinking, ""Hmmm...how can I deny/cease this person? How can I completely ruin this person's life?"" There are guidelines, procedures, and policies SET BY CONGRESS that we have to follow. If you don't like it, write to your congressman. Having this type of attitude doesn't help anyone. If you approach your disability analyst like this, all you will do is come off as unhelpful, angry, and potentially violent. The more cooperative you are, the easier your claim is.

The cheap firewood is often softwood that burns hotter/faster but also can produce much more smoke. Not good for those with breathing issues.

On camp chairs, in [my photo](https://i.imgur.com/f602Q0X.jpg), you can see my camp chair. Folding, but have armrest and a side panel so I have a place to put my morning coffee and a book.  Those chairs are sturdy enough I can use them for a little support as I get up.

There are combo sprays that are sunscreen and bug repellent. 

You can also find ""screen tents"" so chairs and table can be set up inside a bug free room.

Pack extra feminine products. A variety of styles. I've been camping with friends who were caught off guard and didn't bring enough. 

Remind campers ZERO FOOD in the tents with them. Diabetics may need emergency candy bar, too much insulin, but   bears can smell OPEN wrappers (so maybe bite size product that can be opened and consumed). 

Cots - already mentioned

Water - I have five gallon jugs with spigots. Handy to fill up (as heavy as you can carry) then on their side, so now I have a facet at the table. I put my plate washing jug under this to catch any extra water (it will be used later for washing dishes). 

Spiral notebook, pen attached with a string, big clip to hold pages down (keeps wind from flippling them around).

Cooking -- I do use the ""moutain house"" meals. Pouches are usually 2.5 portions. That and Knorr Rice. Catch is how to boil water, measure 2 cups and pour. Most picnic tables have slats so spilling scalding water can still burn knees (can not move fast enough).  Rice takes 1 cup of water. Pour cold into a pan, cover pan to reduce evaporation. The two cups goes cold into my tea kettle (whistle on it) and brought to a boil. Kettle easy to pour into the bag (set timer to remember to stir, close bag, another time for soak time).  I'm not trying to measure and pour boiling water, just pouring. The multi time events is a challenge after a long day hiking. I've messed up dinner more than once!   Hence notebook to jot down times (I've made notes on first page about my timing).

Canned soup. Easy for car transport, and there are days when sipping ginger ale and a can of chicken noodle soup is all I can eat. So I pack about a dozen soups (simple to heat up and consume).

Yogurt. I need it in the morning to help swallow a dozen pills. Apple sauce also works (daily I take about 30 pills, some with food, some without. My phone/watch are my reminders... brings me to the next thing:

Solar Chargers for USB Charging phone and Watch. I keep them charged, but off grid most vehicles can use plugs. Still my watch has a custom cable. I also get lost, I did a simple hike out to a stage coach when my son hiked up tallest point in Texas. Easy walk for me, but coming back I missed a turn. My Golden Retriever blocked me and kept telling me ""this way"" brush had covered the trail (we pushed through on the way out, didn't see the turn on the way back).  Good doggy.

Whistles. Ya, pretty silly but not a bad thing to keep on you.  If every learns three short - three long - three short it is pretty obvious a distress signal. Let folks know to remain in place (we teach kids to talk to a tree and not leave that tree). Even adults who know better have panicked when alone and night falls. So everyone in the group should be taught to stay with ONE tree and remain in place.  Nights get cold, so loose wind pants and wind jacket can be stuffed with pine needles/leaves so additional insulation. Oh I had a bear slobber me. No moon, pitch black night, and I was out there by myself. I kept thinking I was imaging things, but bear slobber stinks. Next day the back of my jacket was a mess (slobbered). Bear probably thinking what the hell are you doing out here.  Now I always carry extra flashlights.

I have PTSD, severe social anxiety, and a genetic connective tissue disorder. At the time only my psychiatric disabilities were diagnosed.

Yes. I had a psychotic break due to an extended PTSD trigger before my second semester and stopped attending classes. I also had to move out of the dorm due to panic attacks that would occur multiple times per day. I didn’t understand what was happening to me and it was not controlled in time for me to get through the following fall semester; I dropped out entirely during the first week of my sophomore year.

I didn’t have a social experience. I couldn’t make friends or talk to anyone due to my psychiatric issues. I spent all of my free time with my boyfriend, who attended a different school and came to pick me up frequently (he commuted from home and I was at school nearby.) I was friendly with my coworkers at work off-campus.

I did not get support until after my first year, and it wasn’t through the school. I was not comfortable using the college’s services for assistance as I had already had a rough experience there. Unfortunately I had to go through several professionals before I found ones that helped me.

I did not have accommodations and took a full schedule. I plan to return to school in the fall and it will be drastically different in order to accommodate my physical and psychiatric conditions - online classes, disability paperwork on file, etc.

I am currently in a much better place, living mostly independently with my now-fiancé and my service dog. I work full-time in a supervisory capacity and am more active socially. My disabilities are much better controlled, though they require complex treatment and management. I would not have reached this point had I remained at school.

I’m going to combine my answers for these last two. Adaptability is important. Willingness to get help, and also the ability to look for help - because your college will not reach out proactively. A sense of humor. A relaxed attitude. And just being mindful of what college you choose and why you want to go there. Don’t lose sight of your support system.",,,4,0,0,

I have an 8 year old with CP... so, what do I do?? What are the rules!!?? /s.. but in all seriousness, this subreddit is great for advice. So, what do you guys think? How hard do you push therapy, how hard on socializing, etc... 

I tend to push about as hard as a moderate coach with therapy and that feels fine (tbh, he's very self-motivated with therapy so it's not a big issue), but I'm at a total loss with the social stuff. He's recently made some friends, so this doesn't keep me up at night quite as much --  but sometimes we go to cub scouts or whatever and he's just not into it, doesn't want to participate, and my gut is to push him out there -- you don't want it to become a habit -- but shit, I don't know, it's just so hard for him to be heard and understood and he's absolutely brimming with funny, creative things to say. I know he's frustrated but I can't sit by and let him become a shut it in... there are days, where if I let him, he would sit on the couch all day and stim (he self-soothes by 'stimming', which for him is basically him rocking on the couch and making car like noises. Most of the time he's making up stories while he stims (kid's gonna be a writer, I'm sure of it) , and there's no harm in it, and it makes him feel good, but I can't let him do it for hours...)

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: I've noticed he's really not very accepting of other kids with disabilities. It's like he wants to separate himself from them, but his tactics -- ramming into people's chairs, shouting at them-- are not so cool. I'm sure it's a phase, but that doesn't mean I'm going to allow him to be a jerk. Does anyone here remember going through that when they were younger?",,,1,0,0,

d2dc87fa-aae1-4ce9-8ced-322ec2d467b4,1556392559,"Q. Any advice on what we can do?  

A. Go with your friend to police station so that she can report the sexual assault and ongoing unwanted contact by suspect male and other possible sexual assaults by 

same individual.

Q. What organizations can I contact, or are their legal ways to ensure that he stays away?  

A. Tell your friend to ask the police for assistance in this matter and follow their advice.  This is a complicated matter because the individual involved has a criminal record, history of violence, mental health issues, and so on and so on.

NB: Tell your friend to ask the police for appropriate mental health resources in her community to help her deal with the trauma caused by her interactions with that individual.  Tell your friend to also change her telephone number, get an unlisted number, and never post that telephone number for anyone to see.   If the individual involved also knows where your friend lives help your friend find a new place to live and advise the old landlord to not pass on those details to anyone except by court order.  Until these actions are taken your friend's well being and perhaps her life maybe at risk.  She might wish to have a peephole installed in her front and back door.   
 You may also be at risk if you happen to be visiting your friend at a place the individual may already know.

98258667-73a0-442d-b8f7-98d4b4ad2629,1554834706,"Transitioning is a good word for what you're going through. I like to call it ""adapting"" because it makes me feel like a badass overcoming nature, but that's just me. I used to call it ""lowering my expectations"" which just wasn't healthy at all, or accurate. My therapist called it ""grieving,"" as the process does seem to mirror the five stages of grief. I got stuck in anger and denial for a long time, but that depression is sneaky, it creeps up on you. Acceptance was difficult, and I don't always feel like I'm all-the-way-there, but it's something to strive towards I guess. I'm so sorry you're going through this, OP. But I'm going to go through some things that helped me a lot.

First of all, let's talk mobility devices. I was really stubborn about this, too. Part of my stubbornness includes completely throwing out options that I don't like. I didn't want to *need* to use a wheelchair, so that wasn't an option for me. To me, the chair was a symbol of everything I'd lost. And I held on to that for a long time, and I think that's partially a good thing. I needed to learn to push through the pain to a certain extent, I'm going to have pain forever so I'd better get really good at it. But at the same time, other aspects of my disability had already eliminated so many options that my world became very small, and very sad. You talk about living in a prison, and that's truly what that felt like. Except I had built up some of the walls myself, and I was the only person keeping me there. 

At some point, I got fed up. I got tired of sitting in bed crying because I was in too much pain to leave the house. I'm not trying to say that you aren't sick of hurting, but I think this might be similar to what addicts refer to as ""rock bottom,"" though I've never been an addict so I can't say for sure. Basically, I was so miserable and frustrated and lonely and *bored* that all of a sudden, using a wheelchair didn't seem so bad. It's all about perspective, really, and I got a really good view of what my life will look like if I don't utilize all the tools at my disposal. 

So I planned a trip to the mall with my husband, and we brought my second-hand wheelchair that I'd never used outside my apartment. I hadn't been able to go to the mall in years, all that walking and standing would send me into a week-long flare. But oh. My. Goodness. I could *do* so much more with my chair! We went to three different stores, getting lost navigating elevators in between, and I felt amazing! Afterwards we even went out to lunch, and I was fine! I realized that the chair wasn't the prison, the chair was the bulldozer that knocked down all the walls I built up in my anger. It doesn't *confine* me, it frees me. And that's a really important distinction. 

Here's my main point: Once I stopped rejecting those options that I didn't like, my world got bigger. And I don't know about you, OP, but I really needed my world to get bigger. My disability takes away enough options from me without me eliminating more. I don't think I could have realized this right away, this was a lesson I really had to learn on the journey, so to speak. But my conditions are progressive, so I had to kind of get a walking start. Your situation is a little different because it's from an accident, it must feel like being thrown in the deep end. But I believe in you, OP. Humans are amazingly adaptable creatures, and you're going to learn to tread water because you *have* to. I know that's a shitty answer, obviously you want to get back on dry land where you're comfortable. But it's the answer we have, and you're gonna be a great swimmer, OP. 

Another thing I wanted to ask, are you a writer? Or did you ever want to be? I ask because I really enjoyed your style in your post; you talk like you're a writer. When I was healthy I was convinced I needed to pursue more ""practical"" career paths, be a banker or some shit. But my dreams of gainful employment were more-or-less dashed when I got sick (not saying yours are, I got all sorts of health issues unrelated to pain and mobility in my way) and I realized there was no reason for me *not* to write anymore. There was also no reason for me not to get all the tattoos, crazy haircuts, and piercings I wanted. I actually keep a list of things my disability has *given* me, as opposed to all the things it's taken away. It took me time to find these things, but it might help to know that being disabled isn't all about losing. You can't beat dat VIP parking, and I never wait in lines if I go to a sportsball game or something. I've had my disabilities for 6 years now, and I can honestly say I'm pretty happy most days, and I'm a hell of a lot stronger. I wouldn't change anything. I would have been a terrible banker, and I'm a pretty damn good writer. This is one of the few fields where I feel my disability gives me an advantage, I'm a lot smarter and a lot wiser than I was Before, and I'm a lot more observant. Now, I can't imagine going to a Normal job in my Normal life, I like what I've built too much - pain or not, disability or not. 

Good luck with everything, OP. I'm here if you want to talk. I just want you to know that you're stronger than you know, you're going to adapt, and it's not always going to feel this horrible. It doesn't make right now any easier, but you are moving towards something better &lt;3",,,2,0,0,

You can't fairly compare your disabilities to others, either.

I've often wondered if a definition of pain is being forced to concentrate on something.  Just like you might be forced to concentrate on an  injured body part, you are finding it hard to take your mind off of your hand.  You are letting it take up too many brain cells, letting it define you even to yourself.  You should recognize this and seek out some sort of counseling.  You can't make up your own tools to deal with this, you need a real counselor.  And at your age, trying to find one on your own can seem insurmountable. You should have a school counselor who could help you, or could help you find someone.  I don't know anything about your parents.

Maybe a prosthetic would help you be less self-conscious about your hand.  It wouldn't be so obvious to the casual observer and you wouldn't have to feel like everyone around you is noticing it.  And I don't know how many hands I had to shake at your age.  I've gotten to an advanced age without shaking that many hands, I think.

That's all I can think of, except I don't know why ""pirate"" refers to your hand.  A pirate might have a missing eye or a peg-leg or a parrot on his shoulder, but missing fingers?  That's pretty lame as insults go.   Oh, there's a pirate with a hook for a hand, isn't there?  It's still lame.  ",,,8,0,0,

I may have missed what kind of insurance you have, but it may be worth getting on Medicaid or figuring out a way to go through physical therapy. It may work, it may not, but doctors want to see you’re trying and SSD wants to see that you’ve tried multiple treatments and it’s not working or you’re still having issues.    

As far as a lawyer, just google around. They will tell you what they think of your chances because they see lots of these cases and usually have a good idea of how it may turn out. They will be paid from your back pay if you win your appeal.

See listing 8.06 https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/8.00-Skin-Adult.htm. Also if the lesions and abscesses due to HS result in an inability to ambulate effectively, this condition can also equal the SSA listings for musculoskeletal disorders, or result in a determination of an inability to meet the basic physical demands of any work.

If you have a doctor you have seen on numerous occasions and is available to provide additional information about your conditions and work related limitations that is generally very helpful. As long as your doctor’s opinion is generally consistent with their treatment notes and other evidence, SSA should give your doctor’s assessment significant consideration. 

On a personal note, I have relatively mild hidradenitis suppurativa outbreaks, at least since my surgery years ago.

My father is convinced that there is nothing physically wrong with me. It doesn't matter what doctors say, he still thinks I have a form of muchausen by proxy. He thinks my mother is intentionally making me ill, despite the fact I haven't actually lived with her for nearly 10 years now. My father has a lot of mental health issues that he refuses to accept and is extremely abusive and manipulative towards me and my siblings. There is nothing that I can say or do that will change his mind so the best approach I have is to just not speak to him anymore. Obviously, this approach is not possible if you have to live with the person, but for me, it was the best option.

The situation with my mother is rather different. Her hostility towards my disability stems from her own insecurities and misconceptions about disability. She has an SCI as a result of cauda equina syndrome and she has not worked a day since. Until recently, her disability has not been at a point where she couldn't work, but her own ideas about disability made it very difficult to challenge misconceptions about disability. She doesn't see disabled people as being productive members of society and projected this view heavily onto me. I think another part of her didn't want to accept that I have life changing disabilities. She told me that there was no point trying to finish my degree, because the chances of me succeeding were minimal, and even then, I wouldn't be able to hold down a job so what was the point? In her eyes, the thought of me using a power chair was quite alarming, so she was trying to tell me that I ""wasn't disabled enough"" (I mainly need it for work), yet I was too disabled to ever hold down a job... Confusing, but it was just a mix of her not wanting to accept my being disabled, coupled with her misconceptions about disability. In time, she has come to see that what she said was not right and that has helped her to change her behaviour towards me.

Coping with disability is often a kind of grieving process, and it is not just those of us with disabilities that grieve. My mother still had to grieve for the life she thought I would have. That includes going through the denial stage and I do my best to understand that she wasnt trying to hurt me and be unkind, but it was how she could best cope with it at that moment in time. My father on the other hand is an arsehole through and through. Nothing will change that and it simply isn't worth my time trying to build or rectify a relationship with such a manipulative and abusive person.  I guess you need to try and evaluate whether or not this is something you can work past with them or whether or not it would be best to cut down on contact for a while a reevaluate your relationships.",,,8,0,0,

This is a irresponsible mischaracterization of what is happening. Under the Obama administration your social media could be used to *supplement* other evidence, and it could only be accessed *after* they had reasonable suspicion that you were fraudulently on disability.

The change by the trump administration will allow them to **proactively** view your social media in an attempt to *find* people who are “faking”. 

This is a huge fucking difference, because in the past posting a vacation photo was harmless so long as there wasn’t anything else that would raise suspicion and cause them to investigate you. Now, posting that same photo is enough to spur a full investigation and more than one will likely be enough to remove you entirely.

The biggest problem with this bill is that this sort of “check whenever” mentality goes hand-in-hand with automated searches using facial recognition. Mark my words now, we aren’t but a few years away from bots trawling your social media *every single day* looking for updated posts that it believes don’t fit with your pattern of disability. Those posts will be forwarded on and you’ll be under review in a matter of moments. 

Finally, there’s no way to stop it, Previously, the check was an optional tool that could be used to support existing evidence. Since it’s now a proactive measure of gathering first-line evidence, they have a fair argument that making your profile private is an attempt to evade their investigation. I know this sounds like I need a tinfoil hat, but we know (through leaks of the PRISM and FIVE-EYES programs) that the US government is already working with social media companies to get unrestricted access to your information.

It’s GOOD to use whatever mobility aids you need to live life.. but it’s also really important to use the correct ones and to use them in a way that helps improve your health and doesn’t risk injury. 

Talk to whichever doctor is most involved in your diagnostic process and tell them how you are feeling like you need a wheelchair and ask if they can help you go about this the right way.

&amp;#x200B;

Are you a current college student?  

1983-1991 

What is your disability?

Learning Disabled. 

Can you describe your disability? 

I had/have difficulty taking notes and concentrating on lectures simultaneously. Taking tests. Typically essays and research papers would take me days to complete whereas ""normal"" students would take less than half the time. Learning always takes me 2-3x longer than ""normal"" people. Writing is fairly neat but my hands tire quickly. I cannot write without lines. Math is also bad to the point I need help with basic forms like the Easy Tax forms and I need paper to work out sales.

Do/did you face any difficulties in college due to your disability?

In the beginning, there was little or no sympathy with professors. (bf ADA). I did get help and tutoring from Disabled Services

After ADA, it was  new to the University and the Professors. So navigating and advocating for our rights was precarious at best. Most allowed ""extra time"" but with suspicion.

\*I had a OT student friend who was seriously dyslexic to the point he needed his books on tape, and Dragon Dictate to do papers. He had 1 class  Kinesiology  he could not pass because the OT Dean AND ONLY Kinesiology Prof refused to allow his exams to be oral. I regret losing track of him as he was in the process of suing or appealing.

What  is/was your social experience like in college? How satisfied are/were  you (4 being very satisfied and 1 being not satisfied)?

I have always been socially awkward. I made no friends in college that stayed friends after graduation. For me, it took too much time and energy to study to have a real social life. So i would have to say 2.

Although, by University (San Jose State), I had a group of people I hanged out with during breaks. We were all disabled in some way. We called ourselves ""Gimps R Us.""

How do/did you find support? What types of support do/did you get? 

Both before and after ADA I received Support. Before ADA, you had to ask/plead with professors to get extra time on exams. Before ADA, I had Specialist try teaching me study habits, tricks with reading and note taking. By 1989, I got the university Backing for the Profs to comply. I found just borrowing other people's notes better than relying on note takers because  my disability was not a priority for note taking.

What is/was your educational experience like in college? Do/did you have accommodations?

I received free computer training, free tutoring for math and science and extra time for exams. I occasionally needed help with proofreading.

Were you able to overcome your struggles caused by your disabilities? How were you able to overcome it?

I am still socially awkward as fuck. It affects my work and personal life. I never quite learned to ""read"" people properly. (No I do not think I am Autistic) I come across as ""weird"" although I still do not get why.

I still have difficulties typing fast on the computer and writing is sometimes physically painful.

Math is still very hard and causes anxiety

What five traits do you think disabled students should develop in order to have a great college experience?

1. Learn the Art of Manipulation. Ideally, anyone with a disability should be treated just like everyone else. We do not want to be treated as second class citizens, children or broken. BUT when it comes to accommodations: YOU MUST USE YOUR DISABILITY TO YOUR ADVANTAGE. Any backsliding is only going to cause you to LOSE benefits and assistance. If you have a minor disability (like me), you need to make it look worse than it is.
2. Know your Rights. Learn to Advocate. Profs are not going to believe you. Health Services are going to be assholes and if you have gait or speech  difficulties Campus Law Enforcement are going to be ignorant. 

\*had a friend with minor CP -a speech impediment and dragging foot repeatedly accused of drunk in public.

3.  Use Financial Aide, Grants etc, to your advantage. Some of these Grants never accessed! Investigate everything about yourself: ethnicity, experiences, religion.

4. Patience.

5. Thick Skin. Other peers are going to see you receive extra accomodations and resent it.

What should disabled students do to have a great college experience?

I did, in fact, make much more money in the past that did not have concurrent increases in my upside disability benefit.   I paid for an income stream that was fixed on the upside and apparently could be reduced on the downside to zero.   I am trying to review the terms but that was never disclosed by the agent and I guess I should have reviewed the 40-page plus policy in detail to see all the outs NW had built in for themselves.    I believe my lower income made my insurable interest disappear if they have the right to reduce the payout based upon lower income.   I guess the company should be more upfront about changes in income.  Very unclear on their sales pitch and not very specific in the policy.  I make deals every 3 to 5 years and my income fluctuates wildly.  Having a disability during a low or no income period basically means all the years I have paid into the policy are eliminated.  Probably should have killed the policy when I really did not need it but I assumed it would pay should I become disabled.  A bad assumption I guess.   I have found like many others the policies are fraught with many loopholes in favor of Northwestern.   Now they are trying to sell me a longterm policy....",,,1,0,0,

A lot of people don't realize that SSI is a poverty-based disability program and that SSDI and Medicare are not accessible to most people with life-long disability. If you haven't earned enough working credits comparable to your age, you’re not SSDI eligible. 

The SSI income limit for a disabled SSI recipient married to a non-SSI recipient is $1,157/month of countable income. That means if your spouse is making $1,157/month at a job—you are disqualified from SSI. That’s an income cap of $13,884/year for 2 people. The federal poverty guideline for a household of 2 people is $16,460/year. Your spouse must support themself and your disabled self on an income $2,576 below the federal poverty guideline without you receiving a penny of SSI Disability. 

The SSI income cap for a single disabled individual is $771/month of countable income. That’s $9,252/year. The federal poverty guideline for a single person household is $12,140/year. 

You might say that some of these people qualify for uncounted income by way of food stamps/SNAP—but food stamps doesn’t take into consideration special nutritional needs disabled people are more likely to have. Also, cooking and prepping your own food is cheaper—but is more difficult or impossible for disabled people. If you’re disabled and buying pre-made salads, frozen entrees, and generic Ensure, that food stamp money is going to go fast. 

It’s doable, but it’s so hard. 

And then there is all the judgement of society (and even within the disability community) of SSI Disability recipients needing to work part-time in order to supplement benefits—e.g. “THEY’RE NOT DISABLED ENOUGH!1!!”— or not working when maybe they could try working a little because they will lose some or all SSI benefits which they cannot risk given the instability of their health, the job market and legal accessibility issues or hidden job discrimination—as if one’s ability to work or not work is totally black-and-white. 
Like those people who lose their minds when they see a wheelchair user stand or walk, because in their minds, wheelchair = paralyzed legs. Disabled people are scrutinized no matter what.  

&gt; And it's not like there's a whole bunch of other ways to disqualify someone from SSI/SSDI.

Exactly. In addition to the reasons listed above, the SS Administration Offices have online forms to report benefits fraud. 

Hello, Big Brother. 

When people think you’re not disabled enough to receive benefits, they get nasty. I know I’ve been publicly shamed by a cashier for using food stamps. I’ve been shamed by family too—despite trying to hide my disability benefits. 

That’s hostility towards disabled people.",,,21,0,0,

(I've always wanted a baby but I lost the ability at 25, we were at the hospital to pick up a baby boy when his bio mom changed her mind, and then the surrogate couldn't conceive and we were out of money.) 

So I walk into church with my brother and his kids and my sister in law, and this woman I've never met walks up to me and says, ” I'm sorry for what happened.” And I look a little shocked and said ” I'm hanging in there,” wondering if this woman has some psychic ability to know that I'm dying inside knowing I'm probably going to die childless. 

So a few weeks later I'm visiting my family again and my sister in law says, ” you remember Hope (not her name, can't remember), she was the one that said she's sorry about your leg.”

And so I had to laugh because here I'm thinking she's this gifted mind reader, because 9 years later I forget that people notice my leg, and for weeks I've been wondering how she knew how upset I was since I'm notoriously stone-faced when I'm upset because I hate showing weakness.

I've literally had surgery just cause I hit my elbow. So, I use this stall to prevent my arms from getting hurt. Also, my arms stick and I can't move as easily to use the restroom thanks to my arthritis and bone disease. A normal stall is too small for me to try to move around in to unlock my elbows.

 What is STABLE?  A STABLE Account is an investment account that allows qualified individuals with disabilities to save and invest money without losing eligibility for certain public benefit programs including, but not limited to, Medicaid or SSI.  STABLE Accounts are made possible by the federal Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act passed by Congress in 2014.  STABLE Accounts, administered by the State of Ohio Treasurer’s Office, launched June 1, 2016. Ohio was the first state in the nation to launch an ABLE program.  STABLE Accounts are similar to a 529 college savings account and can work alongside Special Needs Trusts. They also function similar to a regular checking account. What are the Benefits?  STABLE Accounts provide financial independence and empowerment for individuals with disabilities by dramatically increasing the ability to save and invest.  Before, individuals with disabilities could only save $2,000 before losing needs-based benefits.  Now, STABLE Accounts allow individuals with disabilities to save and invest up to $15,000 annually without affecting eligibility for certain public benefits programs.  Account funds are used on Qualified Disability Expenses including: education, housing, transportation, healthcare, assistive technology, employment needs, basic living expenses, etc.  Earnings on a STABLE Account grow tax-free and are not subject to federal income tax, so long as they are spent on Qualified Disability Expenses. Who is Eligible?  An “Eligible Individual” is someone whose disability began before the age of 26, has been living with their disability for at least one year, or expects their disability to last for at least a year.  An individual must also do one of the following: 1. Be eligible for SSI or SSDI; 2. Have a condition listed on the Social Security Administration’s List of Compassionate Allowances Conditions; or 3. Self-Certify their diagnosis.  Visit stableaccount.com/eligibility/ to take the quick and easy eligibility quiz to learn more. What is the STABLE Card?  The STABLE Card is a debit card participants can use to easily spend money from a STABLE Account. It is available at no cost to all STABLE Account holders.  The STABLE Card is a loadable debit card. Individuals can take specific amounts of money from their STABLE Account and load it onto their STABLE Card for Qualified Disability Expenses. How do I Enroll?  A STABLE Account can be opened by a qualifying person with a disability or an Authorized Legal Representative (ALR). An ALR is a parent, guardian of an eligible individual, or a designated Power of Attorney.  Online enrollment is free. Account set up and enrollment is done online at [stableaccount.com](https://stableaccount.com).

2ac304c7-2647-401b-882a-1b648b9c18f9,1554645910,"Kids are assholes. Initially, the questions or looks come from a place of curiosity. Our brains are wired to see differences, and ask about them. 

Around middle school, kids start forming deeper social identities. They want to fit in. And if the popular kids make a joke about someone, they'll copy that behavior to fit in. 

Part of the issue could be solved by you confronting some of these friends. They might not realize these jokes make you feel like shit, if you don't make any point to show how upset you are. Some of your true friends might stop if you call them out, and they might even confront others. 

A couple of pieces of advice:

1. Know that people grow out of those behaviors. You'll still occasionally have an adult ask something kind of rude, but for the most part, all of this will be a distant memory. 

2. Own it. Their jokes don't have the power to hurt you if you joke about it yourself. ""You can count on me, but only up to 7!"" or ""Could someone lend me a hand?"" -- This path will encourage others to make jokes, too. After all, if you're ok joking about it, then they should be, too. But it takes away their power if you're able to laugh with them instead of them laughing at you. Maybe next Halloween, fashion up a hook hand and dress as a pirate. Own the jokes, so that the jokes don't own you. 

Just to give you some background with myself: I was in a bad motorcycle accident in August 2016. My left leg was severely injured, and I'm getting it amputated below the knee this summer. Since day 1, I've cracked jokes about my leg (""this'll make it hard to get my foot in the door at a job interview, but as long as I have a leg up on the competition I should be fine."" -- literally one of the first things I said to my mom). If friends joke about me being gimpy or a pirate or something, I just own it. Hell, my nickname in one group chat is literally ""Gimpy McPirateFace"".

Part of wanting to get an amputation is so I can get back into sports. Currently can't do much of anything, but I should be able to be more active on a prosthetic. If you enjoy soccer, you should look into amputee soccer. Not sure the exact rules (since you're not an amputee, but are missing some digits). But the goalies are all arm amputees. Either way, it's a cool sport to watch and follow. ",,,18,0,0,

6616b026-83d3-41af-afac-8d6a93a5e747,1556140160,"Hi; what you are saying SOUNDS correct, in that (if you are found eligible for Social Security Disability) you would pay BACK to the insurer for the months (up to the amount of the monthly SSDI benefit) in which you received benefits, I would also urge you to get hold of the actual plan documents through your company or through the insurer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some things (like whether benefits from LTD are ""income"" for tax purposes) depend on whether the company provided and paid for LTD insurance or whether you did (paid for the policy) and there are clauses regarding whether (their listing you as being able to go back to work) you are supposed to be ""fit"" fit for ANY occupation (probably the usual) or the work you did previously. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even though you didn't fight their decision at the time, it might not hurt to get more information from the insurer, as well, to determine what information led to their decision. Was it based in medical information? I'd get as much information as possible AND the plan documents, because it might not hurt to check with an attorney at some point. I'm just a ""regular person"" whose husband ended up on LTD and then Social Security ... but I did find his LTD benefits had been miscalculated (which amounted to a couple hundred dollars extra, which he then received IN ADDITION to the SSDI). I did a LOT of research and never needed to hire an attorney, to that point. Checking with an attorney will probably be a lot easier and less costly if you have things like W-2s, the insurance documents and and records related to the matter that can be reviewed at an initial consultation.

&amp;#x200B;

Even with the ""any occupation"" clause I think is a feature of most employer offered LTD insurance, there may be stipulations in law (legislative or case) that you would have to have at least a reasonable chance of making enough to sustain yourself ... that's something, depending on the amounts involved, that may influence your decision to seek a legal consultation. For example, say you can work 2 hours a day (based in your disability's limitations) ... that isn't going to cut it in terms of paying bills, etc. I never got into that area of researching the matter, so I can't really say. But I do know that costs RELATED TO YOUR DISABILITY that make it possible for you to work (Income Related Work Expenses) ARE deductible from any employment income, per Social Security, so their may also be some provisions there that are relevant to LTD insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

BTW: reason I suggest possibly consulting attorney is that my husband ended up getting hit with being told the LTD insurer decided he was fit for (any) work ... AND he was getting dependent benefits for our children. When he signed up for the insurance and was disabled, he was a single man, no children. Something didn't ""smell right"" about the ""fact"" that the insurer could come along 5 years after the children were born and claim their benefits, as well (which he'd never have been ""eligible"" for otherwise). Turns out, they ""can't""; there's case where that was ruled on. SSDI dependent benefits aren't those of the person on the record (from which they are drawn), they are the dependent's. Nonetheless, he was (and remains) on the hook paying them back $30k because he didn't challenge it or look into it (he divorced me and made it ""scorched earth"" divorce) so I never followed up on it).  So I know from research and experience that there can be many ""mistakes"" made by LTD insurers. And while I'n not an attorney or professional, I know there are things that can extend the time that you may have to challenge the LTD insurer's claim that you are ""fit"" to return to work, etc. Again, depending on whether the amount involved makes it worthwhile is up to you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully, this brings up some questions for your situation that may be relevant. I met my husband shortly before he became disabled and there was a lot to learn, in addition to dealing with all the other matters, feelings and stuff that goes on. But I doubt he'd have ever realized they had shorted him in his monthly benefits at the beginning ... he had more than enough to deal with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully, this also answers your original question (or at least provides confidence you have it right). You went on LTD November 2016, 5 month waiting period (before eligibility for SSDI benefit payment kicks in) and therefore, LTD insurance was your only income during that time. In March 2017, you begin benefits (SSDI, retroactive) and LTD paid ... so you pay them back (up to the amount of the month's benefit or what LTD paid, if less). I would just check your plan to MAKE SURE; it sounds correct based on the general employer offered LTD, whether the employer or you paid for the policy. Hope this helps.",,,1,0,0,

And if so, is it deemed inspiring because it is, or because its not something that typically disabled people do' - a very good example is the 2014 'superhumans' coverage of the Paralympics (on the UK channel 4). On one hand, yes its inspiring that these sportspeople do amazing things and they deserve to held in a high regard for their athleticism, but should that regard be different from nondisabled athletes?

I don't know the answer - on one hand, everyone's working within their boundaries but on the other, disabled athletes need to overcome more societal barriers to achieve athletic success, and at times yes, their impairment can cause barriers as well. So, I end up boiling it down to someone can be inspirational, but not because of their disability i.e. it is inspiring to see athletes, with impairments, who have to cross additional social barriers achieving - but, if someone is maintaining that such and such is so inspirational \*because\* of their disability, I nope out.

It's almost an argument of onus - what's emphasised, personal lived experience or social role of disability?

If I was to be optimistic, I would say that conversations surrounding inspo porn give us (the entire community, nondisabled and disabled people alike) the space to critically examine these concepts and potentially progress beyond them. People need to be recognised, not the hypothetical inspirational-disabled-person-who-did-a-thing archetype. 

TL:DR - inspo porn often equals objectifying and ignoring lived exp. Its fine to be inspired, but be inspired by the person's actions and not the social ideals of supercrip, which is just another way to separate disabled people not only from general society, but from other disabled people.

—
Just to relate a little, I also became disabled with an extremely painful and progressive condition when I was incredibly active and felt that I had my whole life ahead of me. 
I relied on my body. On its ability to perform at peak and on demand. I was a National level figure skater, a a dancer, and only a few years into my career as a professional horse trainer and instructor. I thought those things were important because they made up who I was; how I spent my time. I was used to unloading and stacking 400 bales of hay and prepping and riding five horses on a quiet day. Plus all the farm chores- feeding, moving animals from one place to another, etc. Being physically capable was my entire identity. I used to feel guilty and frustrated if I got a virus and had to take it easy for a day. Like I was slacking off. 

When I got injured and it set off a debilitating progression, I fought tooth and nail. I found myself getting more injured and very ill because I couldn’t process what my body was telling me now compared to before when I was the dictator of my limitations or lack thereof. 
I was so exhausted, everything hurt so badly, I couldn’t DO what I used to do, I was so fucking angry about it, ashamed at what looked to me like failure, etc etc. 

It was a long and ugly spiral. I became irrational. I won’t go through the whole thing here, but in short, this several years long stage ended for me in a failed suicide attempt. The moment I realized I would die in minutes if I did nothing, my mind was changed. I wanted to live, but NOT LIKE THIS. 

I couldn’t physically get better, but I could DO better. Better at managing pain, better at dealing with disability, better at how I thought about it all. 
I had to let go completely of who and what I thought I was. 
Just because I couldn’t do or be what I used to do or be didn’t mean I couldn’t find ways to enjoy life, or do things that matter to myself/my family/society..

I started making lists: things I cannot do anymore. Things that make me feel physically worse. Things I can still do. Things I might be able to do in time or with help. Ways to spend my time and limited energy that are fun. Ways to spend my time that have meaning beyond the moment. Goals I could still accomplish. Things I’m angry about. Things I’m sad about. Things I need to mourn. What I still have to offer. Things I want to try. Treatments that help. Treatments that don’t help or make things worse. Treatments I would like to try. Creative solutions for specific disabilities or symptoms. 
blah, blah, blah. 

It sounds childish, maybe, but it was a starting point. We only have so much time in life even when we are perfectly healthy. We can’t do it all. Before I chose to do active things I other my body because it made me happy and K was good at it. Later when I was physically falling apart, I tried to working desk jobs or doing things by project so I could save my body (it was still way too much) and even then, there were plenty of things I cared about that I wouldn’t have time for even though I still had the ability. 

For me, my life started again with those lists when I was pretty much bed-bound (and on good days housebound) and just weeks past that suicide attempt. I started reading fiction again. I could do that flat on my back in between sleep. A little while past that, I started getting into cooking as a hobby. Just a little at a time and on good days. Then writing which I used to love to do. Years before horses I dreamed of being a writer. What was stopping me from trying that now? Not work. Not the farm. Not skating. 

There were tons of little steps like that. Slow steps in the right direction.

And other types of steps, like getting the right doctors who really cared, which meant getting medication that made a difference and mobility aids that made things better and learning about how much rest I needed in proportion to which kinds of activity. 

The road towards having a new life was just too long to detail here.. but it went in the right direction and each year my outlook was better and my actual lifestyle was better, too. 
I volunteered on political campaigns making calls from home. I spent evenings playing tabletop games on my big front porch. I gained enough weight and calibrated my medications so that I could get pregnant. I put my 21 month old son on my lap on my wheelchair and take him to accessible local parks and watch him be a kid. He thinks I’m a goddamn superhero. Flew to Denver and pigged out in great restaurants and found accessible state parks to see great views and trails. Things I would have been to busy to do before.. or too anxious to enjoy. 

I know that the pain and it’s friend insomnia are even harder to combat than things like not being able to walk or lift stuff, and I still have to take each day as it comes. I’m not going to pretend it’s some special gift to have to push down that misery. But I’ve been able to do it. To not have so many emotional feelings about the physical feelings. To be a better person and friend and wife and mom than I could have been before I had to consciously look at my life so closely.  And I know that what worked for me won’t be what worked for you. 

But my advice to you would be: be patient with yourself. Let yourself feel what you feel. Work through the anger and loss. And start taking one tiny step at a time to design a life that will work for you with what you have now. 

And if you want to talk or vent or problem solve or reminisce or ANYTHING about any specifics, message me anytime. Your title is accurate in that it’s a transition. This is the worst part. That stage before you have been able to fully process the loss of the Before, let alone configure what will be your After. 

My hope for you is that in a year or two you can watch that TNG episode where Worf gets temporarily paralyzed and wants to die and you’ll want to shake him because he’s being so shortsighted and can’t see how much more there is in life than all the things we already got to do, if not for as long as we hoped. It’s hard when we’re still in the Worf phase but it truly is just transition. 

Anyways, I believe in you. Anyone who can live day in and day out with severe pain and still type up such a witty and humorous-albeit-brutal post has a lot going for them.",,,3,0,0,

""Is it policy to write 100% employable and not 100% unemployable like the award letter says?""

VA is NOT SSA. We literally do not care what they say. We do not care if your disability is 100% related to military service, work, or recreational activities. We don't care why you are disabled, only if you ARE disabled under our rules, which have nothing to do with VA rules.

""Is it policy for 100% TDIU vets to go through this constantly? Is it policy for SSA to ignore Va doctors and what they know from seeing someone every month or less or trust your hired state appointed doctors more? I sent over 1000 pages of current medical reports to SSA last time just for them to turn around and say I didn't provide enough info, Is that normal?""

I don't know what TDIU means. We don't ignore any medical evidence. 1000 pages you submitted? Ignored because we don't have time to look at that because we are required by law to ALREADY REQUEST IT so you are wasting our time and your own tax dollars by sending it. Thanks.

""It""s really easy for you to sit there and say don't take it personal when it's not your livelihood on the hook.""

It isn't personal. It's law. If you want federal money, you deal with federal rules.

""Have you ever been homeless because of your disabilities?""

Honestly, you don't care at this point whether I've been hospitalized, jobless, divorced, etc. because of my issues, which actually INSPIRE me to do what I do.

If you haven't already done this you need to forcibly change your perception of your disability. It is an asset, not a liability. Just being alive and going through your everyday life is immensely more difficult than some scrub skipping his way through life, crying about how starbucks got their order wrong. You on the other hand, are going through life with a thousand-pound rock strapped to your back and are a stronger and more enlightened person because of it. Tenacity, courage, and strength are all attributes you can offer to a potential date that are much more attractive than the bullshit others have to offer.

Just believe in yourself, and it will show. Don't fixate on what you need to do, or what you need to say, just believe in yourself bro. It will shine through and people will respect you and admire you for it.

There's a short window to file for an appeal. If it's  been more than 90 days(I think) your mother's  case is closed. You can petition to have it reopened but it depends on why she was denied.

If all else fails, you can file a new claim but her benefits will likely be less than quoted in the original claim.

If it's  been multiple years since she's been employed, the first step is to call SSA and ask for her ""date last insured"". Hopefully, that date hasn't passed.

Next is to gather as much information as possible. Everything wrong with her, every doctor she's seen, and when she saw them. The medical evidence is the ""meat &amp; potatoes"" of their investigation.

The second is do you enjoy reading at all? I ask because you're a rambler like me, and I thought maybe that means you like words and stories as much as I do. Or maybe you would. Would you be able to make a trip to the library? I know you say you're not comfortable volunteering, but this would be a little different. There wouldn't be any expectations of you, and they have comfortable seating usually. They're free, and if you're in a populated enough area they probably have a huge selection of things. Not just books but magazines, movies, graphic novels, music, audiobooks. Some will have regular events like free showings of old movies and art/culture exhibits. I love my library, and I think it might be a more engaging way to discover new interests? It's a lovely way to kill an afternoon regardless. 

Beyond that, I love going to parks on weekend mornings/early afternoons. They're usually pretty empty (great for my social anxiety) and I'll take a walk or sit under a tree with my dog. On that note, I get all my errands done when everyone else is at work to avoid the crowds. No one is at the store at 9:30 AM on a Monday. I'm a writer, so sometimes when I need to get out of the house I'll just go to a coffee shop with my laptop. I've gotten to know the owner and we're friendly. I really like tabletop and role playing games, sometimes I'll go down to my local game shop and talk with the people who work there about their games, sometimes they'll have demos and they'll sit down and play with me. I know my shop hosts D&amp;D groups and others, that's a great place to meet other people who won't make you feel weird for having social anxiety. There are also online groups you can join where you won't have to leave the house.

Other suggestions that don't involve leaving: for music, have you tried websites like musicroamer that help you find related music? I thought mathcore was dead before I decided to look up some of my favorite bands from high school. Started going to concerts again (which is a terrible idea medically speaking but way too much fun) which is great. I also spend a lot of time writing, but if that's not your thing that's cool. I'm a PC gamer, I'm embarrassed by how many hours I've logged on my origin account. Lately I've been thinking about getting into programming, mainly so I can getting into making my own mods. Programming is relatively easy to teach yourself online, and there are stupid amounts of applications. You can even earn some side money once you get good. I buy adult coloring books, which sounds weird but it's oddly soothing. I read voraciously, I've been working through some old classics that just got added to the free domain. I spend a lot of time on subreddits like this talking to people like me.

f4d18fa8-4341-4c9e-9b7b-df64934a1b8c,1554428784,"I also need the handrails for safety, especially on a bad day. On a really good day I can sometimes flat-palm the wall of the stall to brace myself, and at family member's homes I do this weird thing where I put my hand directly on the toilet seat between my legs and lower myself down though this has sometimes caused elbow and shoulder injuries - But I am NOT putting my hand on the seat of a public toilet, even though my bum is going on the seat, something about putting my hand on the seat just feels too disgusting. And being alone in a public toilet is the last place I want to injure myself or fall, so handrails are important for me.

Anyway, I was on a holiday with my partner in a new state and I was using my crutches so I definitely needed handrails, the bathroom at this park was surprisingly well equipped, they had a male and female wheelchair accessible stall at the front as opposed to just 1 wheelchair accessible stall, and then the standard male and female bathrooms where through a heavy door off to the side. (Not so great for non-binary folk though :/ )

I was busting and unfortunately both wheelchair accessible stalls where occupied because that was also the baby-changing station/family bathroom. So I clenched and waited. While I was waiting a man on crutches walked up, and didn't even blink at the accessible stalls, he just walked right into the standard male bathrooms. 

So I sort of had this moment of ""is there something he knows that I don't, is there a stall in there I can use?"" and asked my partner to open the heavy door for me.

As soon as I got into the standard stall section there was this sign on one of the stall doors [""Ambulatory stall""](https://imgur.com/NMCLbAh) and low and behold, it was a standard width stall, with handrails!

We continued on our holiday, and over the next 3 days, every single major building or major park with a public toilet I went to, I checked in the standard stall section and EVERY SINGLE BATHROOM had an ambulatory stall *as well* as a wheelchair accessible stall.

I could not shut up about the bathrooms and my partner kept laughing that my first time travelling out of my home state (Victoria) to a new state (Tasmania) and the thing I loved most was the public toilets. They could still be better, having the *only* baby change station in the wheelchair accessible stall means that able-bodied parents take up a stall that people with wheelchairs need. And the baby changing station in that stall is set to an able-bodied persons height so parents who are also wheelchair users can't change their babies. Having both a wheelchair acsessible stall *and* an ambulatory stall is great though because it means someone in my situation doesn't need to take up the wheelchair accessible stall, But the signage could be better because there was no indication from the front of the building that there was an ambulatory stall inside the main bathroom.

It's common in Australia for the wheelchair acsessible stall to be seperate from the other stalls, so this isn't unique, It was the ambulatory stall that was new to me!

1) Get a lawyer. Absolutely. It is incredibly difficult to get approved for disability and you’re already working against an incomplete file. Lawyers know exactly the key terms and phrases that the courts greenlight.

2) You don’t have to pay a lawyer up front, they take a percentage from the back pay you get from disability, and there are laws about how much they can take so they won’t be predatory

3). I had confirmations from 9 specialists &amp; 5 surgeries, and SSA’s own doctor said I’d be disabled. They *STILL* denied me

4) It took me 3 years to get I front of a judge, where she look one look at me and apologized for dragging me in, and threw out the old judgement, but at that point, I had my lawyer.

It isn't the words themselves that can be particularly offensive, it is how and when they were used. Able-bodied is fine for example, but 'the superior and mighty able-bodied, beacons of the future and the holy land' is not. It is just in context. Both in how you use it in the sentence and how that sentence plays against either the chapter it is in or the entire book.   


Eventually, it just gets confusing. Given neurotypical is a recent thing and the only way I learned about it is someone calling me non-neurotypical, but it wasn't in rude a way. Least not to me, I am quite aware I come off as peculiar and if iirc it was in relation towards my lovely mental deck of madness as opposed to my blood disease. When it comes to physical nature, as the term to describe me seems to be disabled, it seems perfectly sensible for the opposite to be abled. 

&amp;#x200B;

If a book such as yours, where you look and compare the differences between the two groups in relation to how culture and society effects us, it is only natural to have a term in order to be able to mention them as you explain and elaborate. Aim to be respectful, aim to see both sides, and aim to have empathy towards the symptoms and nature of the issue, and I believe you will do fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have rarely seen the ones who have the courtesy to ask truly say something that is offensive at its core or deeply unsettled me. It is the ones who clearly wouldn't care to have asked in the first place. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not to try and advertise or anything, but should you need any inspiration or further reading material on the subject of how the US system has driven me mad in the attempts to treat and understand my disorders, both physical and mental especially with how related my mindset is to my blood disease, I have been writing a series of articles on the subject. I hope it isn't rude to link anything, but that is why I made a subreddit for it so I can share it when I see the need. r/PotDA as I took to calling it 'Plight of the Disabled American' because I am an over-dramatic writer as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for taking the time to write the books, as I see many cracks that people are allowing to grow. Especially when it comes to disability and medicine. Anyone can find themselves in a situation where they need proper healthcare, it shouldn't be a luck of the draw on if you get that.

7552a8b6-9ca5-4a1d-ae6b-78f23e86325c,1555195439,"my apologies. i just really hate getting into arguments or even debates on the internet. they don't normally amount to a good use of my time.

-

i find that when it comes to dealing with people who don't have a lot of understanding of disabilities, they tend to see people with disabilities as alien and ""other"". they react to us by ignoring us, or pitting us, us stumbling all over their words in an effort not to say anything stupid. in this ableist world the best we can hope for is being treated like everyone else, but even that can be a mixed blessing since we aren't like everyone else and in some situations we do need special accommodations.

-

by using the term ""normie"" it injects a little humour into the situation and loosens the situation up. once you get people laughing a little and show them that you have a bit of a sense of humour about the topic they can relate with you. they stop seeing you as ""alien"" and they stop tripping over their words as they struggle to find words that aren't offensive.

-

also, i just like the term ""normie"" over other similar terms. i guess we can call them ""average"" but i actually find that term to be much more of a pejorative. nothing is special about a person that is average. its also a boring term. i guess you could also use the term ""able"" but that is so serious and formal, not my style at all. the term ""able"" is also sort of a misnomer since most people with disabilities are able bodied.

-

at the same time i don't really see how normie is even much of a pejorative. i don't think there is any serious negative connotation. at the very least i think you would be hard pressed to find a normie who was actually hurt my the term. its all about how you use it i guess. i could call you a ""redditor"" with enough hate in my heart to offend or i could lovingly call you something much worse and make you laugh.",,,1,0,0,

So if a homeschooler isn’t smooth and practiced in talking to another person, it’s because they’re homeschooled. Whereas there’s plenty of shy awkward inarticulate kids who attend public school and it’s not noted because schooled children aren’t unusual so they’re not placed in a mental file of oddities. My youngest has been homeschooled from day one and is the most charming and articulate kid you’d ever meet...I can’t count the number of times that people are shocked he’s homeschooled and make some condescending comment because he’s socially adept. My oldest is shy and tends to be anxious about talking to people, so that’s all attributed to his schooling. Huh, two kids, same house, same education, couldn’t possibly be due to differences in personality or capability, huh?  My absolute favorite is when my son’s shyness is attributed to his disability.  

I get pretty angry about this.  Schooling for a kid who moves every 1-2 years with a physical disability, inability to eat one of the most common allergens in food, and immune issues is awful.  He’s at the mercy of shitty school systems in whatever corner the military sends us who want to fight about 504 accommodations, or don’t have decent programs, or in one case, even achieved basic literacy for their kids.

The basic premise is that SSI and SSDI are for people who are unable to work due to disability.

SSDI is for people who have paid enough FICA taxes through employment. SSI is for people who have never worked OR have worked but not paid enough FICA taxes.

Neither are going to give you an ""easy to live on"" income. SSDI is roughly 60% of what you'd get if you were to collect retirement Social Security on that date.  SSI is fixed at $750/month.

This isn't something to take lightly. *You will have to prove that you are unable to work* and that's usually not an easy battle.

There's zero reason he couldn't have changed in one of the smaller stalls. I had just had a hip prosthesis placed, and bending my hip past 90° was impossible as I was still in a brace, so the low toilets meant i couldn't get back up.

&amp;#x200B;

The passive aggressive projecting of financial stress is just the cherry on top of a pile of never ending bullshit... I need out of here in the worst way but my injury is invisible and therefore I am never getting any form of government income to help me be independent again, they've made that very clear. I am hoping to find a live in landlord situation where I can basically be a babysitter for contractors who takes rent and deals with noise complaints and building security... but those types of jobs are not common, typically attained by family/friends of the building owners and unless common area cleaning and snow removal are done by contractors I am not physically capable of doing the job anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I looked into r/vandwellers but I don't have 100k to build a livable van setup, otherwise i'd be out of here in an instant, regardless of whether or not I can truly survive on my own. I appreciate my dad helping but there's a time when he needs to let both myself and my brother sink or swim... I honestly don't care if I freeze to death next winter, so long as I don't have to live through anymore of this crap it'll be better in the end.

What is resilience?


Resilience is the ability to cope when things go wrong.

Resilience can also be described as:

Bouncing back after difficult times

Dealing with challenges and still holding your head up

Giving things a go or trying your best

Being strong on the inside

Being able to cope with what life throws at you and shrug it off

Standing up for yourself

Getting back into shape after you have been bent or stretched

What helps develop resilience?


Some things that can help develop resilience are:

Having a positive attitude

Finding good friends

Feeling good about yourself

Feeling like you belong

Having a supportive family

Helpling others or 'giving back'

Being able to solve problems and overcome challenges

Good communication with the people around you


What can I do when I’m facing a challenge?

You can start to build resilience by asking yourself:

What can I do to get back on track?

I can’t control everything, so what is in my control?

Can I change something I’m doing to make things better?

What can I learn from this?

Who can help?

How can I move forward?

""By dealing with challenges you can learn resilience and find inner strength you didn’t know you had!""

How to build your own resilience


There are lots of things you can do to develop your own resilience.

 Here are some ideas:

Think positive thoughts

Look after yourself

Keep trying

Talk to someone

Learn from mistakes

Work towards your goals

Look for the positives in the situation

Accept that change happens all the time

Accept that negative things can happen

Improve your problem solving skills

Find things that help you feel calm

Get help when you need it


The earlier you learn resilience the better it is for you...I learnt it when I was 40....wish I learnt it at your age.

You are OK

you will be OK

There are people better off than you

there are people worse off than you

You are perfect just the way you are, you don’t know what is happening for anyone else...there is plenty of stuff going on for other people that we can’t see..we can just see yours...doesn’t make it better or worse...just what it is...

Good luck ....hope this helps ❤️

f4d18fa8-4341-4c9e-9b7b-df64934a1b8c,1556018794,"When I was 18-19 I was really struggling for income, I lived in a rural town in Australia, I couldn't drive, I used forearm crutches full time, there weren't many accessible job opportunities for someone with my qualifications and availability (I was studying at uni and was already exhausted from that and being sick.... But I had bills to pay)

I lived with my boyfriend (at the time) and his family, his mother told me she knew an Avon lady and I should chat.

I was recruited before I even knew what I was signing up for. I was 18, I'd never had a job, I suffer brain fog, I was bombarded with information I didn't understand about commission.... But I'd heard of Avon, I knew it was multilevel marketing but it had been around so long and the products seemed legit so it must be at least possible to make some beer money. 


What I didn't find out until after I'd signed everything is that I have to pay for the catalogues I hand out. $3 per book, and if you don't return it within 4 weeks to headquarters you never see that money again. I bought 6 books, and went walking around my neighbourhood.

.... Walking around a rural town, on crutches... My neighbours are a good 100m apart from each other, and I quickly realised that the majority of people in my town are 40 year old men because it's an agricultural town.

My boyfriends sisters bought products, they ordered $15-20 worth of stuff. I paid $70 shipping to get it, I couldn't bring myself to tell them how much the shipping cost and make them pay for that when the customer catalogue prices didn't mention anything about shipping.

My upline said I need to sell more so my commission covers shipping.

Avon randomly sent me a $270 sample pack without any warning. Sell what you can, return what you can't, pay for what you don't return.... I tried to sell some of it for a few weeks but the return deadline was fast approaching, I went to the post office to arrange the return and because of the weight it was almost $100 to send it back.

My upline knew I was struggling. She asked me for a favour while she was on holiday - stop by her house, pick up the Avon product delivery, sort it, then go take the products to her customers door. She'd give me the direct commission.

I took a taxi to her house since she lived a town over. The box was huge, I had to just sort it in her verandah because I couldn't carry it with my crutches. I then had to load up my backpack and deliver products one by taxi because buses didn't run out here... I don't even want to try and remember how much that cost.

I eventually called legal aide and explained I needed help getting out of this. They provided a consultant for free who helped me understand the paperwork I needed to fill out to leave. I had to take a long train to Melbourne to see them, my health was a shambles from all of this, physical activity, emotional stress and financial stress.

It doesn't take a genius to realise that someone on crutches without a car can't sell Avon in a male dominated rural town, I was naive. But all It takes is a manipulative upline to get someone like that recruited.

10 years later and my old upline has called three times. The first two times I've been honest with her, I have to focus on my health, I am too disabled to be of any value to her as a downline, and I'm too much of a goody two shoes doormat to ever make money in an MLM. The third time I just answered and pretended I'd just bought a new sim card, I don't know who DearyDairy is, wrong number stop calling.",,,2,0,0,

I can relate to the mind numbing boredom and I too am beyond tired of watching tv/looking at stuff on the internet. 

Unlike you, I love to read, but my current medications prevent me from being able to focus long enough to really get through a book.  I found that listening to PODCASTS is a great alternative.

I am struggling with depression as well and focus half of my podcasts on positive thinking... Anything about how to be happier with yourself and improving your existence, despite physical/emotional/mental limitations. That helps me a lot with my attitude.  

I find that if I decide to be happier and interested in something (even if I'm not), I feel better.  It's the old ""fake it til you make it"" strategy. 

Ofc, there are many days that I don't have the mental fortitude to use this strategy, but I've been doing it for about 5 years and I am definitely a happier person and in a better place mentally overall because of it.

The other podcasts I choose are things that either will educate me or that I have gravitated towards as I've developed interest in certain subjects. Listening to some general podcasts was a good first step because it introduced me to different topics and that's how I found some that I was actually interested in.

I'm hearing impaired so this was a challenging approach for me and it was actually suggested by my audiologist as it helps me to continue ""hearing"" by practicing listening to podcasts.

Take time to take care of yourself, whether that's spending time with friends, getting enough sleep, doing hobbies, praying/meditating/keeping in touch with your spirituality, etc. Take breaks from worrying and caring for your mom. You can't help her if you don't take care of yourself first.

I would encourage you to contact disability advocacy organizations in your area to help you figure out what to do to help your mom. Do a Google search. Since it sounds like your mom has both mental and physical disabilities, you could try NAMI (national alliance on mental illness), disability rights groups, a community mental health center, development councils, agencies on aging (they can help people with disabilities regardless of age), a state mental health ombudsman, etc.

As for disability, I'm on Social Security for chronic mental illness. I was told by an attorney that about 90% of people get denied at first. If they appeal, 70% then get approved. And if you have to appeal a second time, the approval rate is even higher. So DEFINITELY appeal your mom's denial right away.

It's really easy - you basically just send a letter saying, I appeal this denial. Talk to the Social Security office where you live if you need help. They're really helpful and kind in my experience. They're not the ones who make the decision: that's actually done by the state department of health and human services, or whatever it's called in your state. Each state has employees who review Social Security applications and decide whether the person is disabled or not.

Even if your mom doesn't get approved for Social Security (although I think she will, eventually) you should contact your state department of health ASAP. They can offer resources like Medicaid and food assistance for your mom, caretakers, transportation, case managers, vocational rehabilitation and supported employment, and a ton of other things depending on your state. Even if you don't want to or can't get guardianship/conservatorship, a case manager can do a lot to help you and your mom. They can connect you to resources and take a big load off your plate.

I'm really rooting for you. I've taken care of my mom through mental illness and my dad through end-of-life physical illness so I can imagine how you're feeling right now. I'm sending you big hugs and lots of love.",,,5,0,0,

Kids in middle school and high school are far more focused on the future, as building for the future is their whole life. But building for the future boils down to accumulating sufficient resources to live in the present, and accumulating resources gets more and more difficult as you get older, so it's fairly normal to find yourself hitting your mid-twenties and identifying resources you haven't accumulated that are far more difficult to accumulate in your mid-twenties than they were when you were a teen. I think many people have some semblance of that experience, even if their concerns feel a lot milder than yours do.

We are also very strongly affected by our reproductive window. I don't mean some obsolete dogma about fertile years or years when it's ""safe"" to have a baby. I mean being during the stage of life where you are most likely to be of interest to potential reproductive mates. While you are in that stage of life it's very, very difficult not to obsess with where you stand in terms of the resources you need to secure mating and care for your children properly when you have them. But if you're a man then at some point you start to lose interest in mating because of normal changes not only in how you live but in your physiology over time. 

Suppose that you're in your early fifties with maybe ten or fifteen years of life expectancy for health reasons, so any kid you had would be barely starting high school, if that, when you dropped dead and unwillingly abandoned the kid. Add to that resource deficits such as insufficient trial and error experience with up-close involvement with women, sexual activity, and appearing young enough to be a good match to necessarily ageist people early in their reproductive window--including other men! Combined with normal physiological changes you stop feeling that your future is reproduction and accept that, well, heck, you didn't reproduce, and now you have better things to do.

tl;dr what you're experiencing is normal and gets better with age.",,,1,0,0,

72a4b557-d4a1-4633-9957-4a87f28862df,1554316353,"Hello:

I'm a lawyer that litigates disability claims. I also have experience with Social Security. 

Starting with question 2 - it sounds like your father should have applied for SSDI (disability) benefits instead of early retirement. His PD may not have yet progressed to the point where he is totally disabled, but SSA eases the standard of disability as one approaches their Soc Sec Normal Retirement Age. So the closer you are to SSNRA, the easier it is to qualify for SSDI. I would assume he will qualify. SSDI has a 5 month waiting period, which will coincide with his STD period, and he'll end up having a slightly higher Soc Sec benefit overall (although probably not by much, as he's very close to SSNRA already). Ask SSA what his SSDI benefit would be, crunch the numbers, and see what makes sense. 

Question 1 - yes, he should apply for LTD as well. CIGNA will generally do it automatically in cases where they sponsor both STD and LTD, but be aware that it's still technically a separate policy and he has the obligation to resubmit for LTD (in other words, don't assume CIGNA will do it properly). There are offsets for SSA benefits under the LTD plan as well.

I would suggest that he request a copy of the LTD policy and review what other income may be offset from LTD payments. Sometimes a disbursement of 401k benefits, receipt of pension plan payments, etc can all reduce the amount of LTD benefits. To the extent that those might be delayed, it would be wise to do so. 

I wish your father the very best of luck. ",,,3,0,0,
c52d51b9-5c84-421d-93a7-69936ae578f9,1554322339,"It is pretty standard for SSA to send the 821 work activity report to anyone up for a continuing disability review who has been employed since their last disability review or determination. If you are unsure about your reported earnings going back that far, you can contact SSA to get clarification about the time periods and sources they have earnings reported for. Also you might want to check with SSA about whether they sent you the right form, work for uber is generally self employment and there is a different form for self employment. 

This form can used to determine substantial gainful activity. SSA generally presumes the performance of SGA if your earnings are above a certain level, but there are exceptions where they might not count as SGA, such as if the work period was very short, or if the work was in a sheltered or subsidized workplace, or if the pay was from sick or vacation time. This form screens for these exceptions.

A large part of the form gives you the opportunity to detail any types of assistance, accommodation, or help you got at work due to disabling conditions (such as lighter or more flexible scheduling, or use of adaptive technologies). Work performed and any limitations or assistance received may be considered as part of assessing your work related capabilities and limitations as part of the review.",,,1,0,0,

I made the mistake of creating an imgur account to share photos with friends not realizing I had to set photos to private otherwise anyone on there could see it. Uploaded some vacation pics of me and my bf at the beach, a couple weeks later noticed random guys had posted a bunch of insulting remarks about the surgical scar on my abdomen (was in a bikini so it was clearly visible).  Someone thought it was from a “bad tummy tuck” and that I clearly needed to go back in “to get more work done”.  I posted a polite response about having had multiple spinal surgeries just to be able to walk and was more concerned with how my body functions than how it looks. I would like to be able to say I don’t care about how I look but it’s hard not to be effected on some level when a group of people decide to tell you how ugly you are because of something relating to your disability. I would like to educate those kind of people about how lucky they are to have the luxury of worrying about superficial things like how they look in a bathing suit while there are many people like me out there who have larger concerns like can I afford the medication that gives me the ability to get out of bed for more than just trips to the bathroom.

My friend who has CP actually screamed at me about how I was ""able bodied"" and pretty much mocked me for trying to explain my limitations. It's a long and painful story that I won't go into.

 So when I see the words ""able bodied"" it rubs me the wrong way, as yeah sure I can walk, but I don't see myself as abled (for the million other things I struggle with physically) If that makes sense? Like you can be technically able-bodied in societies eyes, but still have a disability? Think of like Chiari or epilepsy I guess. So if someone who has an invisible disability read your book, maybe they would feel the same and couldn't relate well?

In Australia it's generally all about being inclusive, so it's usually ""person living with disability"" and ""people living without impairment/disability"", avoiding sugar coating things. Here's a link I found if you're interested. https://www.and.org.au/pages/inclusive-language.html

Just to be clear, I wasn’t at all trying to imply that there aren’t good disabled actors, or that they can’t do the job well. There are absolutely some great disabled actors out there. Marlee Matlin is one of my favorite actors all around, and casting disabled actors is the right thing to do when it’s possible. But it’s disingenuous to act like there aren’t additional barriers presented which, in the case of severe disabilities, can have a damaging impact on production.

What I was trying to be a bit delicate around in that post was the difference in casting an amputee, wheelchair user, or even a deaf person in the lead role of a multi-camera production with a super strict shooting schedule on multiple sets across multiple months, vs. casting a blind actress in the same role.

All of our disabilities are different, and they all present different challenges. Being blind is a huge challenge to film acting. Even if we assume she is already a phenomenal actor, learning each set and where everything has been placed, then moved, then adjusted, then replaced, then removed, and so on, between each 30-second segment of shooting is a massive barrier in its own right. Then there are static vs. moving camera locations, cue locations for composite shots and full green screen effects, figuring out how to enable them to to re-dub their own lines when they can’t see their own lips moving in post-production, CG correction, etc., etc., etc. 

It’s a *huge* burden on production. The cost for shooting her scenes alone would be more than double what it is with a sighted lead. When you double the cost of an already spec/niche show, you are increasing the chances that the show will fail by an absolutely spectacular amount. That alone is enough to prevent the show from ever being made in the first place. 

Then there’s the question about whether you have a responsibility to bring the best production possible to your audience. Is there something a blind lead can do that a sighted lead with blind advisors can’t reproduce? If not, what if the blind actors simply aren’t as good as the sighted actors? Do you have a responsibility to produce the best content you can showing disabled people because doing so increases the likelihood of the show’s success, which increases the possibility that other shows featuring disabled leads will be made in the future? And you have a responsibility to your audience to bring the best production you can. Choosing a sub-par actor based on superficial reasons, whether it’s skin color, disability, or age borders on treason against the production. 

I *know* that there are quality productions out there featuring disabled people, and I love when a project, like Quantico, has the leverage necessary to hire disabled talent to play disabled characters. But the severity of disability has a direct relation to it’s impact on production costs/scheduling, and those are two of the biggest factors in determining whether or not a show gets made. If we insist on only disabled actors playing disabled roles, we’re going to see far fewer disabled roles, and almost no disabled leads.

To me it’s more important to see the representation rather than having it be 100% authentic (at this point, any way). Other people feel differently and that’s fine, but I just want them to understand the effects of what they’re asking for.  

I spent &gt;1/3 my life in acting and production, and I still have friends working in both Hollywood and on Broadway. I don’t know everything, but I’m more tied in than most.",,,2,0,0,

I couldn’t even pay full rent for a year.

I was talking about how my health has impacted my career and education. I've always wanted to be a teacher, especially a special education teacher. As I was talking a girl about my age (20) ekes up and started asking us if we went here and what were majoring in. I could tell she had some type of a disability and she said so later in the conversation. She wants to be special education math teacher because she knows, as a person with a disability, special education is important. 

A few years ago I was at our family's cabin that is on the campus of Christian retreat. A church was their and I was listening to their music. I see a young girl being lead closer to the sanctuary by her parents. She had different proportions than most kids her age and had a tracheostomy. She and her mom came over to where I was sitting and she walks up to me and asks with no preamble ""Why do you walk with a cane?"" She asked same way a kid would ask why my shirt is blue. Disability hadn't been stigmatized to her. Over the next few days I got to know her and her family better. I learned she loved stickers so I went out and bought some. She helped me upgrade my cane and even named some of them. She left a great impression on my heart and gave me so much joy in what was a difficult time in my health.

I ended up making some business cards for his mom and other parents/folks in the spectrum to hand out when people are staring.

Thankfully I save my reports that showed 100% compliance. 

Also sometimes I will listen to an audiobook while wearing the mask or music until I can fall back asleep. 

Finally has your pain management doctor mentioned biofeedback as a potential method to help with pain? I’m just beginning but initial results seem promising, not that I expect no pain but since the pills and injections are temporary at best and become less effective over time, even if Biofeedback only provides a small incremental improvement it’s worth it to me.

I've been in a few stores where it really, really does not seem like there was a whole lot of thought into where the perfumey products are located.  A lot of these seem to be in stores that are older and the number of products that are available now are crowding things and forcing them to make some decisions that don't work well.

I ran into a store to get milk about a year ago, and the milk dairy section was right at the end of several aisles of strongly scented cleaners.  Did not go to that store again.

One of the grocery stores in town recently remodeled, and put the floral department right next to the bakery.  Aside from wheeziness, floral smells do not go great with bakery smells.  I buy all my fresh bakery stuff from another store now and avoid the bakery area in that store.

Several of the grocery stores in my area have started selling soap by the slice - highly scented stuff.  In one store it is right next to the baby products - I want to buy my baby food in wheeze free peace, and I don't want to bring baby stuff home that are scented from being so close to soap bars that are just out in the open.

So one thing that would be very helpful to me would be to put some thought into the location of strongly scented products in the store, or at least use air control/ventilation to mitigate it.

Another thing that I notice - in many store parking lots, the disability parking becomes downright dangerous in winter weather.  They are often near curbs and collect water or the snow gets plowed up and collects, and then it freezes and gets super slippery.  Its a place where an employee hour or two with some hand shoveling and hand spread ice melt would make things a lot safer.",,,2,0,0,

Someone with a stoma or urethrostomy might need extra room and some privacy if they need to fix their bag (probably not correct terminology so apologies if that's the case). Same goes for someone who needs to catheterise to empty their bladder, accessible bathroom generally has a sink in it which means they can wash their hands and get to business without having to touch gross public bathroom doors etc to get into a stall (plus I imagine the extra room is also helpful.

Someone with a prosthetic might need a private space to be able to adjust their device or need handrails etc to safely use the facilities. 

A girl at school had crohns disease so if she needed a loo in a hurry she'd use the accessible loo. 

If someone is honestly at risk of having an accident and the only available toilet is the accessible one then in my opinion they should be able to use it (obviously not just in the sense of ""gah the line for the 'regular' toilets is long and I don't wanna wait""). In this situation obviously it's a case of go in do their business and leave as quickly as possible. An example of this is a little girl at an event crying because she felt she was going to wet herself while her mum was begging her to hold on (they were in a line of 2-3 people.

One of the things I have strived for over the years is educating young ones. Back when I could still walk several blocks with a cane assist two young girls maybe 7-10 were looking at me and whispering. Finally one got brave enough to ask me if I was blind. I told them no and explained how a blind cane would differ from mine. Then I told them briefly what I was dealing with (RA &amp; OA, and post knee replacement). Another time I was at a hotel swimming pool and my gorgeous knees were exposed, yet again some kids asked me what had happened. Of course, the parents were shocked and reprimanded the kids, but I choose to tell them that they were surgical scars from having my knees replaced. Maybe it is because until I couldn't work one more day, I was an RN and a big part of being a nurse is patient teaching. I think reasonably asked questions deserve an answer and hopefully, in the future, these kids will have more empathy when they see a blind person or someone with surgical scars.

I am grateful to live in a small town where most folks are courteous, and I just about always have folks opening doors for me, unloading my groceries from the electric w/c cart, and even had another customer stop what she was doing to put my groceries in my car. All things most appreciated as I never realized how exhausting RA can be as the pain just sucks everything out of me. So sad that everyone can't be like that. Our McD's is by the freeway so a lot of non-locals there. I was coming in while a family was on their way out and the SON, about 10, stopped and opened both doors for me. His dad in the meantime snapping at him for dawdling. I make sure I give those kids a very wonderful and sincere thank you. Just because dad is being rude, doesn't mean that the son has to be. :) Young kids just glow when they have done an act of kindness that was appreciated.",,,4,0,0,

c52d51b9-5c84-421d-93a7-69936ae578f9,1554920058,"Here is some general information and a few suggestions.

It sounds like your conditions are making it difficult for you to communicate with SSA. If you could use help figuring out the status of your claim and your options to proceed, I recommend seeing if you might qualify for help through a reputable nonprofit legal aid organization in your area. If you do not qualify for legal aid, you might want to check if there are reputable disability attorneys or advocates in your area who are available to help. If you do not qualify for legal aid they might have referrals to private attorneys or advocates for you. If you happen to see a social worker, or if there are social workers available at your health care provider, they might have a referral for you. Also, in most areas in the US you can call 211 for referrals to services available in your area.

If you do miss the deadline for appeal and if you are able to show that you have good reasons for missing the deadline, SSA might accept a late appeal. Good reasons include for example, I didn’t receive a notice, I have mental health problems that limit my ability to  communicate with others or to understand and follow instructions, and I tried on several occasions to get information from SSA about my claim, but I was not able to get a consistent answer that made sense to me. See [https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/cfr20/404/404-0911.htm](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/cfr20/404/404-0911.htm). If the 60 day deadline has passed, you can submit a late appeal in writing with a explanation of good reasons why you were unable to file the appeal on time. 

One option you may have is to request a reopening of prior claims that were closed out. A request for reopening can be submitted in writing to SSA and it is usually ideal to explain any good reasons why the case should be reopened. Here is an overview of their policy about reopening prior claims. [https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0427505001](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0427505001) In their regulations Title II refers to SSDI and Title XVI is SSI. If your claim was closed out in the past year or two because SSA did not receive information they needed from you, or if you did not receive the proper notices, a request for reopening may be a good option. SSA will be less likely to reopen a case that was denied based on medical evidence since they generally apply higher standards for reopening medical decisions. SSA is generally willing to reopen cases that have been closed out fairly recently due to administrative reasons (such as not providing requested information or missing appointments) when they find good reasons for why there was an error or misunderstanding.

To avoid problems with SSA, I strongly recommend keeping copies of all paperwork you receive from and submit to SSA. One potential issue is that after you apply for disability benefits through SSA, they send your case to your state’s disability determination agency, who will make the initial medical decisions about eligibility. Make sure to look out for, promptly reply to and keep copies of letters you receive from your state’s disability determination agency.  If there is an issue in the future, having copies of all information received and sent can help you to resolve problems or misunderstandings.

Also, let me know if you want and I can type out the exact questions I ask when trying to figure out the status of a SSA claim and any prior claims. Best wishes!",,,4,0,0,

I’ve done plenty of days (years!) using crutches when I needed a wheelchair and the key is using things correctly and getting enough rest, etc. 
I use SideStix custom crutches and a tilite custom chair. Insurance covered both and after a decade of using off the shelf crutches, custom is LIFE. Same with the chair. Yesterday I used my crutches around the house and for one errand and then the chair the rest of th day because I know my limits. If i didn’t use the chair, I would have had to go home earlier and skipped doing more stuff.. so it’s definitely about using what I need to do stuff, not being confined etc etc as others have said.

Question (Person): There are strict physical and mental health requirements for people volunteering to be some of the first settlers on Mars.  This has created a lot of debate about where to draw the line in ensuring a viable mission and crossing the line into practising eugenics and social engineering of “desirable” vs “non desirable” traits.

How is this being handled within the scientific community, specifically those responsible for determining the criteria of who can and can’t go based on various attributes and do you think this runs the risk of broader social implications, given science does not exist in a void free from society as a whole.

Response (Australian Research &amp; Space Exploration - Space Australia): I see, I think you had a word or two missing in the first comment. 

We've seen no such debate and if people are that sensitive about a successful first stint at Mars they're probably the ones that will be bred out.

Follow up to Response (Person): Sorry if you misunderstood my first post, it was rather brief. Odd you’ve not seen the topic. It comes up quite frequently. I’ve not seen much sensitivity from the debate as more genuine interest from people discussing ongoing social and cultural implications.

People tend to do the things that they come up with them selves. So giving him advice that he already knows that he should be doing, isn't going to go anywhere. If his response to a suggestion is going to be ""No shit"" it can be better to leave those off the table. 

If I can make a suggestion it would be having a heart ton heart wit him. Start it with an ""I"" statement. ""I feel terrified  that I am going to lose you becuse your not seeing your doctors/getting care etc"". Try to start everything with those I statements. When we start off with ""You should/need have to"" it puts people on defneisve.

Keep questions open ended or statements instead of yes/no. Sit in silence while he thinks of his answers. When you want to make a suggestion you could try ""what do you think about/know about..."" if he already knows, your not dropping an no shit suggestion in him.

Often when people who don't live with our disabilities make suggestions, it feels like they think they know it better than we do. Which is frustrating and again, leads people to be defensive.

* Impose different sale prices or rental charges for a dwelling
* Set different terms, conditions, or privileges for the rental or sale of a dwelling (example: a landlord cannot demand an additional security deposit because you are disabled or have children)
* Assign any person to a particular section of a complex or neighborhood or to a particular floor of a building

It seems pretty clear that the management pays for accommodation, which I would argue includes ~~reducing the price of~~  not charging more for first floor units so a tenant has an accessible apartment.

 I'd say though, at least to my perception there is a major difference between the inspiration of celebrities and the inspiration nondisabled people dervive from disabled people. With the celebrties they aspire to be like them, the media photographs show them in an affluent manner; it works as escapism in the sense of 'oh maybe one day' or in the sense of almost like a soap opera; something to comment on, start conversations about. But, with inspo porn it become more about trying to make the nondisabled person feel better about themselves. Essentially, it could be seen to boil down to 'they are doing so well! Even though they are disabled! I'm not disabled, and my observing them doing well and telling them helps them out which makes me a Good Person as I am not violently othering/stigmatising them' - inspo porn is not about affleunce, its about a false recognition of privilege.  

It is related to how awful nondisabled people may percieve disabled lives to be, but to be honest it is more about making themselves feel better because they cast themselves as not like the hypothetical awful people, or examples of disability discrimination from the past. There is never a consideration that a pedestal is just as othering as any other position that draws a line between them and us.",,,9,0,0,

ba452430-62ce-46dc-9207-a13ecd0ba570,1556178421,"Yeah, it's really hard for me, because I so desperately miss the church I grew up in. I was very blessed that my first examples of Christianity were my maternal grandparents, and if protestants had sainthood, my grandfather would fit the bill. 

He was compassionate, selfless, humble, strong, kind, and above all, loving. The only times I saw him very angry, it was because someone was talking advantage of a weaker person. Never for himself. Our church had a few bad eggs, but overall we were a ”speak your mind, but agree to disagree” sort of place. 

Our church shrunk by about 10% when a ”lesbian” couple arrived, and my grandfather made no change in our normal routine. He didn't listen to those who wanted a sermon making the ”biblical” stance clear, he said he'd continue to follow the (can't remember the word but there's a calendar our denomination followed so that every two years the Bible was taught in it's entirety) schedule like always. 

Come to find out many years later, both of the women had been so brutally beaten by their ex husband that they were giving gay a shot (hence the quotes) but after meeting my grandpa, dad, and uncles, they realized they wanted a kind man. However if they hadn't, they still would have been welcome as long as they wished to stay. That was a big lesson in compassion for me as a teenager, after my grandmother told me the whole story. You never know what drives a person, and love is always sufficient.

But as an adult, it's been really difficult finding a congregation that feels even close to what home felt like. As I look longer, I see why people think that a God over christians must be as awful as humans are. But if you read the Bible, God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit offer so much more than the Joel Osteens and Max Lucados and those guys over on CBN ever show. 

It just makes me sad that I have this faith that's sustained me through some incredibly dark times and I want to share it, but so many people have been burned by the door knocking, ambush, fake money tracts as tips, street preaching, hate mongering jerks that the minute I mention faith or devotion, people react as if I'm some sort of brainwashed moron who's never had a critical thought in her life. And it's not their fault that they see me that way, it's my brethren that have caused it.

Keep in mind that you don't have the same RIGHTS to a modified curriculum as you had in high school with an IEP or a 504 plan. Legally, I think they only have to give you access to the room and course materials in a way you can understand and participate.

Certainly, professors aren't in the game of arbitrarily screwing disabled students, and your school probably has a higher General mandate for accommodation then is legally required, however, in the end what you're able to work out it's a negotiation between you and your professors.

Ideas for alternatives to essays would be a PowerPoint presentation, an oral presentation, a YouTube video  Karma an exam, or a creative project. 

Even by a reasonable accommodation standard, though, the difficulty would have to be equivalent, and probably hard to throw together on the Fly. It also depends on the class. Alternatives make a lot more sense in a history or science class then in English composition class. In some cases, an extension might be the most reasonable choice.

In the future , I'm sure you've realized to ask for Alternatives ahead of time and to disclose your disability and needs to professors individually. It's not like they send out a mass memo to everybody who registers at the office as needing possible accommodation.

Your best bet now though is to open up to your professors and see what they suggest or are willing to work with.

Good luck to you. Back when I was in college, I wouldn't ask for the help I needed till I was in tears, and eventually led to me dropping out. I realize it's hard.",,,2,0,0,

Murphy and Jess’s relationship is so profoundly broken in the way that addict/narcissist and enabler/codependents often really are. What, can’t a physically disabled person also be an abusive asshole? Are we supposed to pretend that all physically disabled people are emotionally perfect angels? 

I actually really appreciate this character being far from fake angelic; it humanizes her. It isn’t a super-disabled character, who races his wheelchair and volunteers at the Y with a group of perfectly racially diverse kids on the weekends. 

It shows the warts of a real, interesting, complex, fucked up character who happens to be blind. I’m good with that. 

The one point I’d prefer is to have a blind actor, I’ll grant anyone that. That said, if you look at the history of how various minorites become more integrated into mainstream media, this is at least a start. So, eh.

Just because I can smile doesn't mean everything is awesome and I don't hurt!  


This is an attitude that needs to be hunted out and destroyed. It is something pervasive in the US society.  Look what happens with disability placards if you have an invisible disability. Hell even people with \*visible\* disabilities get shit about placards sometimes if they are ""too young"" to need (a cane, crutches, rollator, etc) Gatekeeping exists from within the disability community as well and that needs to be shut down.

Besides, in facebook you can set your post to public (keep that just to basic memes or pretty stuff), friends, friends except x, or specific friends. However, there is no guarantee that even posts locked down to specific friends will stay that way.  FB has changed their privacy settings before and screwed up a bunch of my posts.

First, we will be traveling throughout British Columbia, Canada. 
Second, we will have groups going on trips throughout the year. 
Third, our vehicles will be close to us at all time (I personally hope to sleep in one as I have traveled our province by sleeping in the trunk of my station wagon); sometimes we will be at campgrounds, other times we will set up in fields. 
Fourth, not all venues have outhouses, some trips will include people willing to house those who can’t camp, other trips will be much roughing it, a shovel and toilet paper for facilities for the latter, I have a portable commode that is raised so that those who can’t pop a squat can sit on a toilet and then empty the commode in a burying site, we will put a sheet around the commode for privacy. 

I have a disability and know what to look out for mobility impairments, particularly with mobility aids, such as the accessible camping sites with paved pads you mentioned. I am hoping to create a checklist for our various trips so that people with differing disabilities can decide if the trip is set up for them. As I mentioned, sometimes we will rough it, sometimes we may be put up in homes. I just want to make sure people can make informed decisions about whether it is the right trip for them. And I want everyone who participates to be aware of other people’s access needs, such as a need for some alone time away from the group (for those who experience sensory overload or are more introverted) or people who can’t stand for long or who need a commode because they can’t go unsupported or people who need instructions and communication in alternative formats. There are standards for inside buildings but I can’t find much on outdoor activities, venues, gatherings. 

Please do let me know if you can think of anything else. I think it is great that you have figured out a comfy way for you to travel in your van. I bet it is different from biking. I used to tent it but I need more comfort now that my arthritis has progressed plus once I’m on the ground, I have a much harder time getting back up. I have foam specially made for my vehicles so I can sleep in the trunk (with the back seat down) which adds comfort. It’s nice to still get out and about.  It’s great to know there are available CPAPs, I will add that to my resource list. Thank you for the link, I will keep that if we do any trips to the states and for other groups we are in contact with in the states. Your van does look comfy, you have it very nicely set up! 

I appreciate you adding your voice. Any further thoughts would be appreciated. Is there anything you wish you had?

caba63cd-ed7f-46d8-8e19-9740273400c5,1556440084,"I may be misunderstanding the story, but is the guy disabled?  The story outlines how he had a job and was told to just “go on disability” after he got fired. So he went on as a response to getting fired, not being too disabled to work?  I’m confused about this but going to assume that this person is disabled but capable of some degree of work.

He got a job through Medicare, and that job is cutting his ours. He can’t get a non-Medicare job. Can Medicare help him get a different job that won’t won’t put his benefits in jeopardy?

If I understand you right, you’re not trying to say welfare is bad, but that the rules of disability are so damn strict (and in some cases, subjective) that if you’re capable of doing a very small amount of work to help yourself out, they cut all your benefits off. They kind of shoot you in the foot sometimes when you try to get creative.

I’m bedridden and even in bed have little movement. Last summer the owner of a business I provided VC for a few years back asked me to do some consulting over the phone and offered for pay. I told him that even though this was a one off and I’d physically never be able to do that consistently enough to do that as a job, that he couldn’t pay me for the consulting or I could lose all my income. It makes it nearly impossible to supplement your income with one of tasks.

It’s good to have the welfare program, but it means you can never really get ahead in your situation because the bar for cutting you off entirely is so low.

In the US there is one specific loophole - you can earn money as a landlord (but you can’t do Airbnb). Only work specifically exempted because it’s considered passive income.

Listen to him if marvels about something and shows interest. Offer him new ideas. Maybe it's easier for him to express himself through music or art?

Question (Person): There are strict physical and mental health requirements for people volunteering to be some of the first settlers on Mars.  This has created a lot of debate about where to draw the line in ensuring a viable mission and crossing the line into practising eugenics and social engineering of “desirable” vs “non desirable” traits.

How is this being handled within the scientific community, specifically those responsible for determining the criteria of who can and can’t go based on various attributes and do you think this runs the risk of broader social implications, given science does not exist in a void free from society as a whole.

Response (Australian Research &amp; Space Exploration - Space Australia): I see, I think you had a word or two missing in the first comment. 

We've seen no such debate and if people are that sensitive about a successful first stint at Mars they're probably the ones that will be bred out.

Follow up to Response (Person): Sorry if you misunderstood my first post, it was rather brief. Odd you’ve not seen the topic. It comes up quite frequently. I’ve not seen much sensitivity from the debate as more genuine interest from people discussing ongoing social and cultural implications.  It seems to be a bit of a touchy point for you given your response. “Breeding people out” probably isnt the way i’d choose to talk about other people with genuine curiosity and questions.

So, my client is a young man with CP who has an incredibly limited range of motion, effectively only having one hand with which he is able to perform near-complex movements as the other is presently in a brace (it keeps squeezing in on him.) Due to an associated intellectual disability, reading is also a challenge, and often messages he receives contain unfamiliar words that he cannot read without assistance. Understandably, as he is a twenty four year old man with a very rich social and private life, he doesn't want his supports, most of whom are older women, reading his messages aloud to him and would rather have his phone read them aloud when he's alone. 

He used to be able to achieve this through an app that created a floating icon that overlaid anything else on the screen.  Tapping that icon specifically would have the phone read whatever messages or app contents he had open underneath. According to his mom, this was part of the android accessibility suite, but having toggled every option I cannot enable it again. According to the client himself (I'm starting to feel really gross calling him 'the client' ugh) this problem began after an OS update, which leads me to believe the update itself altered how the app functions. 

I will show him some of these launchers, though. Giving him bigger targets on the phone's screen would help him with other issues, but in regards to reading his messages, the problem is one of literacy and not so much font size.",,,1,0,0,

This has been going on for a long time. 20+ years ago I watched a Doctor’s staff (hired by insurance) searching the internet for me, printing off pictures they thought were damning and handing to the doctor. If it isn’t SSA doing it directly then it is an insurance company or private investigator. If you have disability in the US then someone along your journey has scoured your social media and/or internet presence. To me... this is not much different than a private investigator taking a picture of you in your driveway doing something you might be able to do twice a year (and you pay for it). The PI takes a snapshot or a video of a small moment. They don’t come back later and film you laying down for three days after. With social media you are doing a PI’s job for them. Should we have the ability to share our lives unburdened by the thought that someone is watching and waiting for us to mess up? Sure that would be great. But it just isn’t a reality here in the US and it isn’t going to be. The fact is, this saves SSA money. They don’t have to pay investigators to do field work. We do the field work for them. If you are sharing social media to the public then you are threatening your future. It is just that simple. Be very careful what you post. Don’t let your friends tag you in photos.

I'll hear ""don't be a spaz"" in old movies from the 80s, but it's not nearly as common as the R word which unfortunately I hear all the time specifically to insult people. However, I see more people get told off for using that all the time, we know we shouldn't call people the r word. I think spaz and spastic are so uncommon that we don't realize why it's offensive (like saying we got gyped, which I never thought about until my 20s and now I'm horrified that it's just a phrase we use.)

Bottom line is when Americans call things spazzy, it's not that we're being offensive (usually), it's that we're being ignorant.

Society sets it up this way, and only some of them stop sucking at it and usually because they know someone who’s sick. Otherwise, they think illnesses are a conflict in a story that’ll get resolved in a dramatic character arc, both because of fiction and because of real live people because society loves a comeback story. They want to help fix you because they think you can be fixed. They really do not get what chronic means and some even get frustrated when you don’t get better.

There’s an added layer of prosperity gospel that holds that if you’re good, you’ll be rewarded with health, so only bad people get sick, so illness is a deserved sentence.

There’s another added layer of being reminded of one’s own mortality which makes people extremely uncomfortable.

And, people hate feeling powerless. Even when they get it, and they believe you, being powerless to make you better really fucks with people.

Finally, people don’t tend to do well with grey areas, so if you aren’t 100% disabled all the time you’re throwing a wrench in expectations. Having good days, wheelchair bound people who can stand up, or having illnesses that flare up but otherwise you seem healthy all can draw weird accusations of faking or otherwise confound people.

Cases of PIP (For those of you in the US, PIP is our disability benefit) were turned over 73% of the time at tribunal last year. Overall the government spent £120 million on tribunals across all welfare tribunals. Disgusting.

What this doesn't mention is the amount of suffering the claimants had to go through as they were without the money they need to eat and pay rent while they waited months for these tribunals.

The last line makes me want to cry. ""But we want to ensure the benefits system is the ally of disabled people and we will do more to gather the evidence we need to make the right decision earlier.""

It will never be an ally. I have a degenerative disability and have received government help since I was 16. I have had to go to assessments 5+ times and been turned down 3 times since I was first approved (and I had to fight the first time!). By definition my disability gets worse, and I have that in writing from numerous medical specialists.

Even when I eventually was told I would get it 'indefinitely' they then changed the entire system so everyone had to get reassessed and paid less.

I mean, imagine if in that episode about the n-word they made all the black characters go around saying that there's actually nothing offensive about the n-word and only silly ""PC"" people avoid using it. But they didn't, instead the point of that episode was pretty clearly stated that if you're not black, *you don't get it,* you don't get what it's like to hear that word. I mean that was the moral lesson at the end, when Stan was like ""Hey, I understand now! I don't get it!"" and explained that he'd realized since he's not black he just doesn't get it and can't understand what it's like to have that word used against him.

It required a proprietary blood test to screen for rare disorders and I have a pretty uncommon one. 

Also, I cannot stress this enough: if insurance doesn’t cover all of it, you can apply for CHARITY from organizations that exist to help patients in need. I got a few thousand from a Catholic charity although I was upfront that I’m not religious. They help people to help humanity as a principle. I really do urge patients to explore Mayo Clinic options.

f7bf1a28-b6ee-42cd-bb75-2fd2fb422cba,1554994281,"I have never met a person with my disability in real life. I have treasured every connection I have with someone who 'gets it', someone who knows what growing up with a disability is like. 

I had the same reaction to seeing this at first, but I think there is something that we, as disabled people need to recognize in this video that most people can't. We have all felt horribly alone at some point in our life. Many of us have been bullied or misunderstood. Our parents had to fend off stupid questions and ignore curious stares. They had to settle with the fact that we may have to deal with them for much of our lives. 

That young woman knows all of this. She gets it. We don't know the circumstances of how they met. Strangers at the park at the same time. Friends that connected online, one a parent only a couple years into raising a child with a disability, one an adult who know what it's like. There is a story here, and a value to it that we shouldn't ignore or gloss over. 

It's easy to see something posted online with a disabled person and classify it is 'inspiration porn'. A lot of it does deserve that title, but if we can't be happy with any of it, we will never see disabled people treated normally by the media, or respected for the unique experiences and perspectives that they can provide.

Disability does stir emotion. I cried when a P.E teacher called me lazy. I was so touched when my friend with autism started bring me snacks in the morning because she remembers me saying I like chocolate. When a little girl with leg braces started a conversation about my cane both me and her mom were so happy because she hadn't reach the point where she was concerned with invading my privacy. She just noticed that we were similar and wanted to talk about it.

I hope that this interaction in the park was meaningful to all parties involved. It would have been nice to get some background on it, but there's something deeper to it that a person giving someone a hug. If we don't take the time to think, notice and be moved by it, we aren't doing ourselves any favors and we are letting things like become karma generators rather than conversation starters.",,,1,0,0,

5d8fcb61-10fc-4404-ad1b-6faea8dcd780,1556424954,"I think American welfare programs hinder people in the sense that they don’t support disabled people to the extent that they need supported thanks to the inflexibility of the programs. 

Even with an ABLE savings account, income limits for SSI Disability are super stringent. That’s because the SSI program was designed to force people back to work whenever possible. SSI stands for Supplemental Security Income—and it’s the only program for lifelong disability. Let me emphasize the word supplemental. That’s right—total and permanently disabled people get a maximum SSI benefit of $770. 


Disabled people who can work part-time oftentimes receive drastically less SSI—which is usually just enough to survive off of. It also ignores the realities that disabled people are less likely to have job stability for various reasons. Unpredictable income means unpredictable SSI benefits. And of course SSA is slow to process self-reported changes in monthly income, so the recipient (living well below the federal poverty guideline) may owe SSA money sometimes. 

SS benefits are not easy to receive—so I would just assume that he does need benefits to live. It’s not his family’s legal responsibility to provide for him as an adult. As for opting not to take a second job—if that would harm his stability as a disabled person, then I wouldn’t judge him for not taking it. 

I did the culturally and personally right thing by marrying my significant other, and soon I’ll be losing my medical coverage even though my spouse is an immigrant who cannot yet buy even his own health insurance through the marketplace (not open enrollment period yet). Why? Because policy makers decided that disabled people with a spouse earning a cent above the federal poverty guideline should be responsible for their own healthcare expenses—even though disabled people tend to need a lot more medical care than the general population. 

I didn’t let welfare hold me back from getting married, but I’m soon to pay the price in terms of temporarily losing medical coverage.

I have nothing like Alzheimer's but was clearly dysfunctional when I applied for provincial disability in the Province of Ontario in 2006. I was approved in two months backdated to the previous months and they seemed pretty eager to hand over the arrears cheque in person. In the 13 years since then I've had one eligibility review at the 10-year mark. It was just a form with part of it filled out by me and part by my doctor. In about a month I got a short note in the mail saying the review had confirmed my eligibility. No real problems since then except those that were my fault (such as not making the money stretch for a full month when it can be done by just having my act together).

Contrast that to a woman I knew in Missouri, USA, with the same diagnosis and similar functional issues, as well as her additional issue of total isolation rather than my poor but supportive birth family, and her awful problem with a Cossack-style landlord who ""didn't believe in handouts."" Her application was denied at first instance because 85% of applications are denied pretty much automatically at first instance. The appeal was estimated to take two years to be heard by a Judge at a hearing but in fact took two and a half years to get heard. In the meantime she had only two choices: find some way to work part-time or starve in homelessness, as panhandling there is Just Not Done. She managed to struggle along part-time in Subway despite a boss who got sick and tired of her no matter how sympathetic he was and was delighted that he could finally get rid of her when she won her appeal. Oops. The Judge barely let her say two words before ruling that she'd had a part-time job for two and a half years and therefore was not totally disabled from work. Therefore appeal denied.

7e36148b-2b74-4bba-b469-eb50434fa64b,1555014758,"Tip 1: 
If you want to date and are I retested in someone, be clear with them :) 
Friend means friend! 
Dating means dating and has other implications. You don’t have to tiptoe around these things. 

Okay, so dating can be hard for everyone. Disability certainly throws another complication on the pile. My best advice for you is to make sure you know yourself well. How is your self confidence? What are your strong suits? What do people love about you? What things do you like to talk about? Are you a good empathetic listener, etc etc.

Practice being social if you haven’t had opportunities lately. I notice that if I’m stuck at home for a week, I become overeager when I’m finally sprung. I talk fast, I get really excited about the smallest things.. I am like a puppy and it’s a little much. I have enough self awareness to tell I’m being annoying and need to tone it down until I remember what it’s like to be a member of society. I’m not implying this is an issue for you, but in case it is, I wanted to mention it.

Go out and do stuff and meet people. Maybe they will be your friend or maybe they are looking to date, too.   Dating is a numbers game. We might have to meet 200 new people before we meet someone who would be a good candidate to date.. and we might have to date 15 people before we meet someone with whom we share long term potential.  Try Tinder. It could be fun. Go into it eyes wide open and with a support network of real life friends who can give you feedback. Disclose your disability before meeting someone in person. Not because it’s something to apologize for- it isn’t. But because it will give them a heads up so they can think about what they are/are not comfortable with, or ask any questions they may have. Tinder is great for the numbers game. Someone somewhere is likely to be looking for the same thing as you: a person to spend time with and have some sexy romance :) 

People will have misconceptions. It’s a pain in the ass that so many people don’t realize how individual every disability is, but be prepared to have to explain that you are looking for a GF, not a caregiver (you can’t hire someone to love you but you can hire someone to keep caregiving separate from your love life). Be prepared to answer questions about what you can and cannot do, including sexually. You want to find someone who is open minded and willing to get creative with you so you can explore this facet of your future together. 

Keep working on yourself. Seeing a therapist, getting a new hair cut or wardrobe, learning new skills, testing out capabilities in the workforce: all opportunities to become the best version of yourself and maybe meet someone along the way. Go to trivia nights at local pubs, join community education classes, volunteer. You’ll have fun and make friends and maybe meet someone.. or at least have a lot of fun things to talk about when you meet someone elsewhere like online. 

I was in a relationship before my disability and had to learn how to keep medical and caregiving stuff out of my relationship and out of the bedroom but I’m really glad that I did. Sure, my husband had carried me up the stairs more times than I can count and pushed my wheelchair, etc etc, but he doesn’t see my disabilities before he sees me. I personally think that contributes to keeping things fun, light, and sexy. That said, one of my good friends is a quad. He’s a super attractive guy and he’s smart and capable. He gets tons of dates and tons of action on said dates. Being disabled or being a quad does not eliminate dating in any way. I am sure you know that or you wouldn’t have posted this, but I wanted to make sure to reinforce it. Get out there and have fun :)",,,1,0,0,

8f4c1b65-ec5d-47ec-9944-6db8fa6ab846,1554501928,"I've watched the pilot of In the Dark twice now. The first time out of curiousity and the second after reading the article. This is my take.

I don't necessarily agree with the article. I think the author Doug T., is doesn't get the main character at all.

Murphy is a 20-something, depressed, heavy drinking, cigarette smoking, blind woman that has a ton of sex. I won't even be as generous as Doug T. and call them one night stands. To me it seems like Murphy fucks and says get lost immediately after the act. Then later she makes her way to the drugstore and gets an emergency contraceptive pill.

Murphy's own words are, ""I don't care about myself...like at all...I think that's pretty obvious.""

Yet Doug is mad that, ""she has no idea where her spare cane is!"" Dude she had an idea--she knew it was near the fucking bookcase and guess what? It was! Yes, she didn't find it immediately and her sighted roommate immediately jumped in to locate the cane. That does not mean ""she has no idea where her spare cane is!""

Speaking of the roommate, Jess. She's an enabler. Not only did she just jump right up to help Murphy get her cane, she brings Murphy Pedia-Lyte, OTC painkillers and water and wakes her up in the morning. She walks Pretzel (Murphy's guide dog.) Get's Murphy to work on time (which I'm sure means more than just driving her.) Yet this is how she is described in the article, ""Murphy’s roommate, Jess (Brooke Markham). Her character really does everything she can to put up with Murphy’s crap moods &amp; self-pity, always tries to be kind and helpful, and proves that one doesn’t need to be a size zero to be considered beautiful.""

Kind? Helpful? NO! SHE'S AN ENABLER! I think that this is just another thing that Doug T. was oblivious to. Jess is enabling Murphy to be how she is.

Also, I find this ""proves that one doesn’t need to be a size zero to be considered beautiful."" offensive as hell.

Let's experiment, shall we?

Original statement:
...proves that one doesn’t need to be *a size zero* to be considered beautiful.

My edited statement:
...proves that one doesn’t need to be *able-bodied* to be considered beautiful.

I find both statements offensive as a disabled woman that isn't a size zero. Yet I see Doug T. finds no problem. Anyone else? 

Back to Murphy moving around her apartment vs. moving around in the drugstore. At the drugstore Murphy knew exactly WFT she was doing she took advantage of her disability and cut in line because she could. She cared about getting her pills and her smokes and getting the fuck out. So we saw that confidence and that she cared to learn where the stuff was and get it. Because she needs those things like she needs she alcohol. Hence why she goes to exactly, one bar. She learned to get around ONE place where she gets what she needs.

She doesn't seem too terrible at her apartment. She's a drunk, she's had a really traumatic incident in the pilot episode and she has an enabler roommate and that's what I saw.

Really, it's tame compared to what I've seen in real life. I've seen disabled people piss themselves because they don't give a fuck. I've seen enabler parents take so much abuse yet still be at every beck and call. I've seen dirty ass apartments and more. This is real life where disabled people have real problems with self-hatred and self-worth, depression and alcohol abuse. Are all disabled people like this? No. I know a lot are, though.

It's not just the name of the show and it's not just the blindness. Murphy's in a dark place in her life. 

Why can't this be a show? So what if Murphy isn't likeable. I find her relatable.

I also don't see the show as ableist. Yes, people have every right to be angry that it's a sighted character playing a blind person but I don't more than that and it's debatable lots of disabled people don't feel that way.

I could go on but I'm on mobile and I'm tired. I need a break but wanted to get this much out here for now.

Sorry this happened to you. Your supervisor sounds like a real piece of work. ��

On reporting: it's *okay* to not feel ready to make a report. Lots of things factor in there. I don't know the specifics of your job or your situation in life, so I can't speak to any of that. One thing I will recommend doing is writing down the who's, the what's, and the where's of what happened. If you do decide to make a report (or corroborate with somebody else when they have a similar experience to yours), those are going to be the important questions. Who was around you? (It's okay not to know all the names of your 6 other coworkers, but just the size of the group your supervisor thought it was acceptable to have such a ""conversation"" with is important.) What *exactly* was said? (This is helpful to have written down because if things divulge into a ""I didn't *mean* it that way"" or ""what I actually said was..."" It can help to have a written account so people can't change *your* story with that nonsense.) Also where. On company property? Was the group out somewhere after work? 

What you 100% *don't* need to know (but people might question you on during the reporting process) is the ""why"" on any of this. Why's are...motive and feelings and a bunch of other intangible and subjective things. Much more difficult to parse, and (bears repeating) 100% NOT your responsibility to have an answer to.

So, I'm a wheelchair user - my impairment impacts my mobility and movement, but my disablity sometimes comes from the stairs. I am disabled by the stairs, not by my impairment. If we generalise out: I am disabled by physical, and other barriers within a society not designed for people with impairments.

Along this line, a lot of people (myself included) will use the word 'disabled' to describe ourselves because it reflects the social positioning we find ourselves in. It isn't impairment specific, and altough yes - experence of barriers in negative, calling that out by going 'No, actually- this society actually does disable me, I am disabled' is not. Its like pointing out the framing device, breaking the social fourth wall- and, to be perfectly honest, there is reclamation of a word that in the past did have really negative connotations. 

Being in a position in which society isn't designed for you doesn't make you invalid. And activists and artists calling themselves disabled, are saying 'yeah, we are disabled but you could fix that' whilst simutaneously going asserting continued prescence and value. 

To call yourself 'disabled' demonstrates an adherence to these principles to a greater or lesser extent, as well as placing you within a line of activists, cultural workers, academics, and people who spend each waking moment running counter to the often ableist expectations placed upon them.

TL:DR - 'disabled' as an identity has a long political history, you can ID however you want, but 'disabled' atm is the word that we have that most accurately describes our social and political positioning, across impairment.

Additionally, they don't just HAVE TO be wide straight leg. They just need to FUNCTION LIKE wide straight leg pants. So, if you can use adaptations to make them appear narrower for stylistic reasons while still allowing a person with limited range of motion in the joints or tight muscles or weakness or pain to put them on like wide straight leg pants that would be awesome.

Last edit:

I also want them to have adjustable waists. Like kids pants. Because of my disabilities my body is shaped in a way  that my rear and hips are MUCH larger than my waist.

Depends for mens. Costco has the best prices. 

I used to go to bed at 10:00PM and Wake up at 1:00AM and just go watch TV or get on a computer. Hallucinations are bad, and minute I would sit down in the afternoon I would fall asleep for ten minutes.

Now I make it a point of trying to remain in bed. I'll wake up, drift off, wake up, drift off. Sometime I got into REM (which is great) but can have either intense violent dreams (deadly snake dropped out a tree onto my back) or just pleasant ones. Had the oddest dream of great sex, but it was with my ex. Oh crap, no, no, no, no. Wake up screaming and in massive panic attack (we are friends, but never going back there!) Hard to explain to my wife what I was screaming about that time. Just another nightmare. My body doesn't disconnect when I dream, so arms and legs can thrash like crazy.  Seperate bedrooms so she can get a good nights sleep.

Sleep study was funny as I was screaming, and the technician came into the room to see if I was OK, still in dream but when the door opened Attila the Hun was invading and I jumped up ready to attack. I had a bunch of wires and oxygen mask on that kept me tethered to the wall! :)

I can not take any medication for pain. I'm on Gab to take the edge off, but any NSAIDS and it is stomach ulcers, and Opiod and my colon just stops (Parkinson's, I have issues with constipation).

So pacing helps. Also I do a form of meditation of mentally being at the beach. Waves rolling in. Sunny day. Seagulls in the distance. Children laughing. Just a peaceful memory that helps me focus on the good things in life. ",,,1,0,0,

Sharing this preface since I’m not sure in what ways your familial relationships are affected &amp; how I cope is, of course, based on the specifics of my relationship.    
    
What I do is 1) Remind myself that people are who they are: I can’t change that, I can only control how I interact with &amp; react to them. 2) Remind myself that no matter what is said or done (or NOT said/done), we love each other and always mean well. So if he has trouble expressing that in a way that makes me feel seen, he must feel the same about me sometimes too. 3) I take time away from interacting with him &amp; focus on things that validate me: hobbies, friends, pets, etc (even reddit lol) when I know that the stress of interacting with him will temperarily outweigh the benefits for me. 4) I remind myself that when stress outweighs benefit in our relationship, that this condition IS temporary. 5) I remind myself that who I *AM* defines me, not how I am seen by others... even important others; even family. A sense of worth is internal &amp; does not need external validation. 6) I remind myself that #5 is true. So even when I very much have trouble believing it if I keep reminding myself of that fact eventually I will feel its truth again.

I’m also a physically disabled woman but my disability was acquired when I was 19 and probably at my beauty peak in the world of typical looking people. In addition to that, my former life was heavily influenced by looks. I was a print model, a commercial actor, a figure skater, a dancer. Perfecting the body in aesthetics and control was a huge part of my life. 
So it really threw my identity for a loop. 
Through years of therapy and self reflection and reinvention, I ultimately learned that all bodies are fallable and forever changing. Sexy is a state of mind. Sexy is knowing who you are and being confident about it. 
Focus in the stuff that your husband loves and can’t get enough of so that you can see through his eyes a bit. Look at other visibly  disabled women on insta and see what is beautiful and sexy in spite or because of disability. Disabled bodies are NOT automatically less sexy. We’re just not used to seeing them sexualized in the same way we see typical bodies. This isn’t always a bad thing, but it can throw you off. 
You will have to find what works for you. Filming yourself, buying great lingerie, working out in a way that works for you, modified dance lessons, looking for other attractive disabled people to skew your perspective, role play.. get creative. 

As others have said, few women are satisfied with their bodies, no matter how “perfect”. Learning to love what we have can be a struggle for anyone. Keep working at it.
