 I had mobility issues before this and was using a cane every day. Yet when I switched over to using the chair several employees came up to me and asked what happened, did I have an accident, as if my mobility issues were something new. The only explanation I gave is that I’ve been less able to walk all day as needed and so this helped me preserve my strength to get through eight hours.

That satisfied most of them, and the rest could go fly a kite because that was all the information I was giving out. It did not impact my ability to do my job at all so it was really nobody’s business.

My aunt had a ton of money, and so does my dad. My aunt had me sign well over 50k in gold coins into a bank account with her and my name before she died so I'd have a cushion. When she got sick, my money hungry dad and his sister got power of attorney and wiped all assets into their names. My dad lives in a 200k house, his sister does, my brother does. I live on a semi truck with my husband, who has been the only person ever to make sure im okay and show me unconditional love. Im grateful for him every day. My family never provided. 

We've had weeks without food, or money for it, we've lived in a tent, tried to rent a room and it ended up being a drug house and we both got assaulted.

Edit: [The most recent data of the registry of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation indicates a current 1-year survival of 84.5% and a 5-year survival of 72.5%. After 20 years, ca. 21% of patients are still alive, according to the international registry.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387387/).

e038a184-d3ea-496f-9f65-20567dafebfe,1575408062,"&gt; How do you guys stay warm and still mobile. any suggestions for a good jacket or coat that's warm but also wouldn't get in the way?

A slim fit waterproof like the types for walking and hiking. I like mine to be just long enough to tuck under my bum, it keeps your back warm and it can be tucked in away from the wheels. If you don't have mud guards, get them. Cuff adjusters and underarm zips are both great features, the cuffs can tighten over your gloves to keep the wet out of your sleeves and the zips can be opened if you're pushing hard and need more shoulder flexibility. 

Most importantly, keep your legs and feet warm. If you have movement, wiggle your toes frequently to keep circulation going. I like compression socks with a big woolly pair over the top then warm boots. Look at fleece lined trousers if you're outside for long periods. And layer up! 

&gt; what kinds of gloves should I be looking for?

Head to a workwear supply shop. My favourite winter pair are meant for people who work in freezers. Be aware that anything fully waterproof will mean the sweat from your hands can't evaporate and those gloves will reek unless you buy several pairs and wear in rotation. 

&gt; do you have any advice on how to deal with snow in the wheels, especially when you're on your own?

Stay in the house with a cuppa. 

If you can afford it I love my off road wheels and freewheel. If not you can add grip to your tyres by attaching zip ties at intervals around the rim, with the nobby end bit sticking out to the sides (so not on the pushing surface) and the tail clipped short. It's not ideal but it does give some extra grip that can get you out of dugin spots. I have a lightweight trowel attached under the chair for sticky bits. 

Always have a plan of who to contact if you get stuck, in bad weather you can't count on someone being along in time to give you a shove out and staying still in cold temperatures can go bad fast. Friend, uber, someone who can come and pick you up. 

Also get a good absorbant mat for your front hall or you'll spend half the winter cleaning mud tracks.",,,2,0,0,

Whatever the situation, survival is the key word, as you note. That, unfortunately, means that ""thriving"" may not always be possible. If you're still in the process of figuring out how long you can go for using retirement funds at your current lifestyle level, do that. Afterwards, figure out every single thing you can possibly cut out and still survive, similar to what u/bendybiznatch suggests. Getting along as long as you can on only the mission critical systems is key.

They only accept the case if they know they'll win, and they only get paid if they do win.  My lawyer was paid 15% of my back pay, which is really amazing.  She and her office did all the work, helped me find resources to help me while we went through the process.  It was 2.5 years later that we were in front of a judge, and said judge was appalled I was denied in the first place.  

My lawyer informed me that disability cases are approved over 90% of the time if the person applying has a lawyer to help.  Otherwise they're denied immediately after applying the first time.  

SSI will only allow you to have $2k at any given point.  If you have a car, property of any kind, that's considered a form of income and source of funds.  If you're even a penny over the amount they permit you to have, you will be investigated for fraud, funds will be frozen, and you may even have to pay them back.

I had only worked a few years, was denied because I hadn't worked enough (the typical excuse), was never in the military (the military doesn't accept anyone with epilepsy), and told me to basically fuck off.  The lawyer saved me a lot of work, a lot of stress, and also saved my life.

Plus the huge issues even talking to people, especially about something as personal as this. 

 I looked the work credits and it seems they go from when you were first disabled, so if you're disabled before 21 you don't need any, and the younger you are the less you need, or something like that. I'm not sure when they would say I was, since it's affected me since high school, after HS I lost jobs because of it, but it's gotten worse and the past few years I've hit rock bottom.  I don't know the exact dates but I would say I worked 5 or 6 years total since 2005.  So this seems it's all up in the air.

I’m Disabled and sick, not the same as you; even if we had all the same dxes, no two people are affected the same. I struggle with loneliness and how to balance it all. 

I have found Twitter incredibly helpful for giving me a sense of community. I was bed bound for 2 years and I don’t know what I would have done without all the people I met on there. 

Inspire is an online community where you can get specific Asthma-related advice of all kinds. 

Finally, I find that taking time to reflect can be helpful, for me at least. I’ve gotten to the point where I ask myself what I’m willing to give up, what I’m willing to risk to get more balance in my life. What I want my life to look like, within reason, and what small steps I can take to get there.

I often just put my head down and buried myself in work or depression. It was awful. I've moved since then and disabilities still suck, but just being in a better city can really help.

Good luck getting through the next half of your journey. Soon enough it will be over, behind you, and just a bad memory. I'm glad to hear it sounds like you have a loving and supportive partner.

I don't mean to go against your wishes and give advice. But one thing that I was able to do with my disabilities (not sure if it's an option for you) and I was really surprised helped was to get into shooting. Rural types freaking love guns and teaching people how to use them. Hunting  was like football or going to church for these people. Anyway, I got invited to go once and despite not being the type to really want to, had fun with it. The people who invited me turned it into a regular thing and it became a fun bit of hobby I could do and made me feel like one of the regular joes. It happened late in my time out there and I wish I had gotten the chance sooner because it really helped to just have 1 regular thing to look forward to. So I guess I'm saying this not because I expect the exact same thing to happen for you, but just to say that even a small invite can turn into an unexpected opportunity. Hopefully something will come up and give you a good distraction.

And that's not okay. That's ableist as fuck.

On the other hand, I am more concerned with the fact that people are literally getting harassed and attacked for not 'looking disabled enough', including here in the UK a witch hunt to get 'fakers' off of disability benefits. In both the UK and the US, disabled folks have yet to acheive marriage equality--the government punishes us financially for finding love, and in some cases even steps in and says ""no, you're too disabled to marry, we forbid it"". And let's not even start on how it's now trendy to use the environment as an excuse to deny disabled people assistance/accommodations that they need. I am waaaaaaaay more concerned with handling those problems than I am with whether or not someone uses 'crippling' as an adjective.

The problem is, there are a lot of people who claim to 'mean well', but what they mean is they want to use supporting us to get likes/fame/internet points/etc but don't actually care about ***actually helping us***... And what they do is, they choose the least difficult thing to focus on--in this case 'ableist slurs'--use it as a cudgel to attack people who say something perfectly innocent like ""oh no I did something dumb"" (again, for internet points and clout), and then pat themselves on the back for doing \~oh so much\~ for the disabled community. While I'm still over here having people kick my cane out from under me or tip me out of my mobility scooter because I don't ""look"" disabled.

I also think there is a lot of gouging in this market. Insurance companies negotiate payment rates that might only pay the retailer/manufacturer 30% of their ""normal fee"". This serves to inflate the price for all the reasons you mentioned. The maker still needs to make their $1000, and now they have to work with insurance gouging them for a 70% discount. On top of that, I believe plenty of retailers are taking undue advantage of the disabled and charging boutique prices for inferior products.

My issue is less with the absolute cost of the part I replaced, and more with the combination of inflated cost and inferior quality. Usually in a niche market you find an increase in quality that outpaces the inflation in cost.

My physically disabled friend absolutely regards lame and crippling as, if not slurs then ""reclaimed""/context specific language, and so regards it as offensive/inappropriate to say ""crippling depression"" f.ex (you can easily say debilitating depression, there's no need to say crippling). I lean towards sharing this view.

We both have the opinion that idiot is on the offensive side, but stupid is difficult. Not just because it has become very integrated into language, but because it's hard to find a good term that substitutes for it well. Most suggested substitutes just... don't substitute for it, they have different connotations.

I guess my guidance would be, do you *need* to use the word? No? Then maybe don't use it. Avoid the issue entirely, while also increasing your tendency to be aware of what you're saying.

If there's *genuinely* no substitute for the word you're using, then it *may* be ok to use depending on the word. Some words I'd still not use, honestly, or if I ""had to"" I'd censor it and possibly use a footnote to ask people for advice on other words to use in its stead.",,,3,0,0,

However,  carbon composite is brittle and can break. The on break I have ever had was when they were lying on the floor and I stepped on one. The damage, however, was only on the edge of the verticle part and was not important, so I never had it fixed.

Since then I have always kept then in a place where I cannot step on them. In the almost four years I have not noticed any wear on the carbon composite part. The only lifespan problem I have had was the strap that goes around the leg. It is made of a Velcro-like material and will lose its ability to stick. Rather than ordering new straps, I used [Velcro strap](https://www.staples.com/Velcro-3-4-x-12-Velcro-Self-Grip-Strap-Black/product_191929) that I got from Staples.

Are there a few? Yeah, probably. But there's a common belief that it's easy to scam social security and it's absolutely false. It's very difficult to get benefits even when you're clearly disabled and can't maintain full employment.

The process of applying for benefits and receiving a decision takes years, when you factor in several levels of appeals. And in most cases they review your case every three to five years and basically go through the process all over again. It is a lot of work and a huge amount of stress.

If I was able to work full-time, I would much rather do so than deal with the Kafka-esque bureaucratic nightmare that is the Social Security Administration. Everyone I've ever known who has dealt with disability or any public benefits feels the same. The people who work there are, in my experience, lovely and truly care. But the system is so incredibly complicated that it's a nightmare for everyone on both sides of the process.

What the article describes is an arbitrary and irrelevant proposed regulatory change that serves no practical purpose but will complicate things for recipients of disability as well as the staff who administer social security benefits. They're basically going to make reviews more frequent for a huge number of beneficiaries (every two years instead of every three to five). It will likely result in hundreds of thousands of people losing benefits, but the additional cost to administer it will mean there is no significant savings to taxpayers. (Reviews are very time-consuming and expensive.) Also, the ""money"" saved will be expended elsewhere for other public assistance for beneficiaries who lose benefits. The financial burden to our medical system alone from a few hundred thousand disabled people losing Medicare benefits would be massive. Everyone pays for that one way or another, whether in taxes or higher premiums that subsidize care for the uninsured.",,,24,0,0,

A doctor won't perform life threatening surgery such as the amputation of a limb in a healthy patient because it is a major surgery with major risks associated with it.

All of the examples you gave are examples where the person is either already disabled or their current condition puts their life in danger. An infected limb that requires amputation is putting the patients life at risk through infection spreading to the rest of the body and causing sepsis. Epilepsy is life threatening if it cannot be controlled with drugs and brain surgery often doesn't result in disability, instead removing one. Removing a non-functioning eyeball is also not causing a disability that wasn't there already. It may be done so that a more aesthetic prosthetic can be worn in its place, but it is not causing a disability.

These kinds of surgeries cost a lot of money, as do living with the consequences of them. I think a major cause of offence that people feel has to do with resources. Would you be happy if resources for surgeons, physio, rehab, equipment etc. not to mention the GP appointments, community nurses, carers and everyone else involved in the care of disabled people was being used out of choice? A lot of us have enough trouble accessing these services in the first place without more strain on the system so I feel like people have a massively negative reaction to the few people they see as putting more strain on the system and exposing the disabled community on the whole to a whole new kind of prejudice.",,,9,0,0,

Though as I said to the other commenter, they just barely started to recovered from the loss of their brother. 1 baby just arrived and my other son is getting married.  The 2 youngest are very empathetic but also extremely emotional when it comes to me or their brothers. 
I would feel awful if I started them stressing out again, even if only emotionally,  since finances aren't the issue. I will protect them with all I have so I feel I should wait until they have had time to settle into family life or had a chance to start one. 

It is their level of kindness and empathy that concerns me. One, because they would be unable to direct their anger at the man mostly responsible (my ex killed himself after his second wife took his kids and left), but two, because I vowed to myself never to stand in the way of becoming the people they want to be. Me living with one of them or even rotate would require sacrifices on their part when I'm unable to function. This is unfortunately another of my mental health conditions.  The constant need to protect them even if its concerning myself and my wellbeing.  I will address it at therapy.  Perhaps there is a way to slowly bring it up that will make me not feel as guilty and feel like I'm dumping a bombshell on them.

I think the best evidence of the tale would be a sky shot of the courthouse before 1990 and one after 2000 - you'll note the judge's parking is removed from the immediate areas and replaced by handicapped parking. Also, that the sidewalks were repoured to meet accessibility standards. As I recall, they also had to complete renovate the restrooms (I particularly remember the woman couldn't GO TO THE BATHROOM without EXPOSING HERSELF to whomever happened to come in the room).

I can't readily find the news article, but I'm sure if you contact the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, they can pick it up. I think the story is something like a reporting trying to access the old courthouse while this lady sits on the stairs so they can 'have her experience'.

this link may be a good first step for you. it can help you start to look into different ENs that are brought to you by SSA. 

your local social security office may also have a list of nearby and reputable ENs. you don't have to visit if you don't want to or aren't able to - just give them a call and let them know you are interested in finding a local employment Network and see what they say. Google is also your friend here, because they may be able to provide you with ratings from folks who have previously used their services.

some ENs are better than others, but rest assured that every single EN has been vetted and approved by SSA (nobody can just claim to be an EN for the sake of it). the process you have to go through to become an EN is very rigorous and strenuous and in-depth, so you can have that has your peace of mind, but each one is different and has a different options, services, strengths, etc that are up to you to figure out which is best for you.

ALWAYS ASK QUESTIONS! :) if you visit an office or make a call to someone and they don't have the answer you were looking for, never be afraid to ask the person if they know who else might be able to help you better or if they know of any other similar available resources. lots of these folks work in offices or have teams of people involved in various support systems in various ways, so even if they might not know the answer, you can be pretty sure there is someone else nearby who knows the answer. just politely press them! they work in teams and often collaborate with each other, so don't be afraid to advocate for yourself and ask where else you might be able to find useful information. they won't be offended, they will be pleased to see that you are advocating for yourself!

you may also want to try your state's local 2-1-1 link ( https://211maine.org/ ) . I'm from NH and we have 211 here also. they provide a lot of information about a variety of topics, including things from disability related assistance to financial, heating, employment, housing, etc.",,,2,0,0,

Yes, they successfully treated the blockage, which is why it wasn't there when he did the endoscopy several days later. My ONLY beef with the hospital is their treatment of me based on his say-so which defied all logic. This one doctor is the only one I feel I have to have some recourse against. They admitted me around 5am on a Friday morning, treated me for five days (takes 3-5), and when he didn't see a problem on day 6, YELLED at me. I came out of twilight realizing I heard yelling, and only as I came to realized it was him yelling at me. I'm leaving out so much, but the staff reactions confirmed that this was extreme.

The ERs are great. They treat me. Then they admit me, expecting me to get the same treatment upstairs, and that's where the trouble begins. Last time, for example, the hospitalist wouldn't treat me because he wanted my GI to. That's when I sobbed in pain for 10ish hours, with the nurse at one point crying with me. My GI consult showed up after 23 hours and my pain management consult never showed up. Again, witnesses - my mother and husband were there the entire time. The nurse even called Medicare to see if I could go AMA and go back to the ER. Of course, they denied it.

For literally 40 years (surgery age 5, first hospitalization age 10) they have treated me the same way. Now, I am treated like above. In desperation, I agreed to having a big T cut into my back to be able to medicate myself via implanted pump, but it isn't nearly as effective and the side effects are awful.

It's mind-boggling. Six months later, I still feel like I MUST be dreaming. One doctor thinks I'm faking for reasons we can't even begin to guess at and it's like 50 years of records, x-rays, etc., all vanished.

It may not be malpractice. I don't know what to call it, then. I have suffered unnecessarily for six months, and have a wet face as I'm typing this from crying in pain. It was like this guy just hated my guts and was out to get me. He even said, ""You're lucky I don't code this in such a way that medicare won't cover it."" I reminded him that I have a voice mail of his colleague telling me to go to that particular hospital because this doctor wanted me there, and that made him even angrier. I honestly wish the whole thing was filmed. So bizarre. (That's another part of this whole thing - that was the first time I was ever in that hospital, because HE told me to go there so he would have privileges, and now doctors think I went there because my usual hospital discovered my ""drug addiction"" and shut me out.) The whole thing is an ass-backwards nightmare that I can't wake up from.

All I want is for doctors who don't know me to read beyond that hospital stay and treat me based on my long-documented medical problems. My 9-5 doctors are wonderful. They can't help me at 8pm on Christmas Eve Eve, though, when pain medication has already worn off, but I am not taking anymore because I'm still vomiting from the first dose.",,,2,0,0,

I called multiple med Mal attorneys both locally and those on the 800 number you see on your screen in the afternoon.

I don't like inspiration porn, either. But this isn't inspiration porn, it's a blind guy who's figured out how to use his cane to feel where things are well enough to do skateboard tricks. That's cool.

The title is a bit porny, I'll give you that. If it was my title, I'd have put something neutral and descriptive like ""Blind guy skateboarding"".

I don't like it either when people say that we're ""inspirational"" just for living our lives, doing regular things or figuring out new ways to do things. We're creative; we have to be. That doesn't make us extraordinary, it makes us human. I think we should celebrate the ordinary, human ability to work around nearly any obstacle, find ways to pursue nearly any goal, without using it as inspiration porn.

Failing is also part of being human. Non-disabled people fail all the time, and so do disabled people. We need to stop stigmatizing failures and shortcomings. Inspiration porn hurts non-disabled people, too, because:

Inspiration porn implies that:

1. Disabled people are ""inferior"" to non-disabled people.
2. This disabled person's ability to do something normal or outstanding is unexpected and special.
3. Non-disabled people, because they are ""superior"", have no excuse for failure, and should feel ashamed and invalid if they fail.

It shouldn't be surprising that people find ways to do things they love, and it shouldn't be considered extraordinary that disabled people work around obstacles, find detours and shortcuts to avoid them, or occasionally just brute-force smash our way through them. It's okay to celebrate it when we do; it's not okay to use that to tell non-disabled people that they ""have no excuse"" because, of course, they are just as fallible and human as anyone is. And ranking people by ability is just plain wrong to begin with.",,,6,0,0,

Although I am not on any medications now, I had some inexplicable anxiety post-uni, and a low dose of some anti-anxiety meds seemed to be all that really helped after I'd done everything from therapy to an endoscopy.

 I kicked the anxiety, and the meds were very low, so I am not suggesting the same path could work for you, but  these days, doctors can work with you to find good doses of different mixtures that may prove very effective for you. I also understand not wanting to mess with your brain as it were, but the literally crippling anxiety you're getting is messing with it already and in addition, messing with your entire life. It's even severely impacting the chances that you might get disability to get food and other basics that you might have no other way of getting. 

All that is to say, I do get it, but think about not writing off this entire avenue all at once. No one wants to be a lab rat or anything, but think about it as a possible way to normalize some of how your brain is working and make life overall just a better experience for you. You mentioned one specific med that caused adverse physical symptoms, I am not sure if you tried others, but there's many things out there. Being able to leave your house and see a doctor will be a huge step for you on the path to possible disability help.

The longer answer is what he did will depend on various factors within the exam itself and the specific policies at your uni. Many professors have three or more somewhat varied exams in order to discourage cheating or copying from neighbors. If you were taking your exam in a closed environment with just you, that is obviously not an issue, but it doesn't mean he couldn't necessarily give you a different exam.

Without knowing the structures of the class and what was in the two exams, it is harder to say if he was allowed to do specifically what he did.

Many instructors choose to tell students ""don't bother copying answers because there are slightly different versions of this exam that you'll be getting"" precisely to make sure there are not complaints of one student having it easier or harder. It *sounds* like the exam you got was substantially different, which may be an issue the uni can address.

To be a bit clearer, it sounds like your professor may not have understood that the accommodations you get for your disability are under ""normal circumstances,"" or the normal testing parameters that everyone would get. It is possible he felt that with a quieter environment, added time, and memory aids, that it was okay to make a longer or more difficult test in your case.

I can't work enough to make more than SSDI on an annual basis. I make zero a lot of months. If I'm having a great month medically, though, I am only allowed to work 20 hours, where someone who makes less is allowed to work 40, 80, 150, whatever. I'm still not sure how to say it clearly... since SSDI is based on ability to work, not on ability to earn, then the cutoffs should be based on hours, not money. If someone is able to work 37.5 hours per week, they shouldn't be on SSDI. 

I am a sole proprietor. If I'm not working, there is no income. I believe a small business has to be at last two people to fit under a lot of what you posted. 

I meant that I was on private insurance before SSDI. At the height, I was paying $2,100/mo. for horrible coverage, basically catastrophic insurance.

I'm happy to read there is a trial period, though. I just had a surgery that I'm hoping is the first step to a lot more better days. I wondered what happens if you try to work again and find out that you still can't.

Lots of practice. Years of therapy. 
I used to be so angry. So frustrated. 
And just the level of pain I’m in all the time meant that the littlest thing wohkdbset me through the roof in fight mode. 
I had to really embrace learning to be kind to myself. Changing the measuring stick for what mattered in life. Letting things go. All of that. 

The good news is that the more I practiced this, the better I felt physically and mentally...AND the better I got at things. I was able to accomplish more that would have previously ended in a rage quit because I can mentally step back and come at it calm and deliberately. 

First though? 
Honor your anger.

I also disagree with the notion that these people are disabled. They have a psychological disorder. That is very different. People with many forms of psychological disorders lead lives in our societies in completely non-disabled ways. In other words, disorders of the mind, while obviously not neurotypical, do not necessarily have to be disabling. 

I realize you want to give a lot of credence to the notion that those who suffer from BIID have such an extreme case of the disorder that we shouldn't be judgmental of their choices, but that is simply not the case. 

A life without throwing away healthy physical parts like they are complete garbage--the very idea anathema to my existence as an actually disabled human being--is perfectly possible for these individuals. 

Unfortunately, being disabled can affect more than just the individual.

After I was denied the first time,  I got the advice to get a Social Security Lawyer for my case. I did not have to pay any fees up front.  Their motto was that you only pay them if they win your case, and then they take payment straight from whatever back payment you had. 

I know SS isn't doing huge back payments any more, but something like this still might exist.  It is still my understanding that applying and all takes several years-- for me it was over 2 years. 

I did win for mental health disabilities. I have very severe PTSD,  anxiety,  depression, suicidality, etc etc due to extensive trauma. What has kept me on was a mixture of mental health and serious physical health issues that popped up as I got older. I think I was barely 20 when I got it. I'm 31 now. I do want to give you hope that there is a possibility to win with mental health disabilities. I had quite the doctor/ hospital paper trail which helped immensely. My lawyer did all of the requesting of documents and it helped to ease my stress. 

I get around $800 a month because I had very limited work history. Just to give you an idea of the funds you'll be receiving. 

Be aware,  there are some caveats-- if you want to ever get married, you cannot keep your benefits in full (if at all). I am about to legally marry my husband and I am forfeiting my benefits. This generally includes Medicare and Medicaid. You also have to be careful on who you live with and how you present it to SS. If you are living with a relative, partner (even not legally married) etc SS determines that they should be paying part of your bills and will cut the amount of money you get. If you have whoever you are living with write a letter saying you rent a room, that tends to save things, and how I lived without SS determining that random people I lived with were going to pay for me. 

I don't say this to discourage you. Disability income is what kept me alive over the years. I just wish someone had spelled the above things out to me clearly so I ran into less stress. I hope this info helps and you get what you need. Good luck. 

Also, your disabilities are valid: if you use the term disabled about yourself, you are disabled ""enough"".

If you need even more stability I would look into a hemi cane that’s available on Amazon for about $30. It folds up flat but basically has four legs and two handles, the lower one of which I suppose is to help you get up although I’ve never used it.",,,2,0,0,

I just get kinda annoyed by inspiration porn like this. While I admire what he's doing, a Herculean feat, I get so frustrated by abled people that use these examples as a metric, that disabled people should be able to overcome their disabilities, we know you can and you're only disabling yourself etc. It takes immense effort to overcome a disability, and sometimes we don't always have the energy and shouldn't be blamed for that. 

And at the same time it irks me that abled people need reminding that disabled people are still capable despite being disabled. But if we remind them we're disabled they'll think they're helping us by insisting we're just differently abled or whatever. Tell someone I'm autistic and they'll be like ""excuse me, you're so much more than that, you're a person with Autism!""

It's just something that happens at clubs, and it's not just you or just disabled people. I use a cane, and although I haven't been to a ton of clubs, I get touched there quite a bit. But I think many people do, as drunk people can be a bit handsy. 

This is true in bars as well. I get pats on the back and such. Whether it is because they notice I am a relatively young person with a cane, I don't know, but it happens. Many of my abled friends often tell me stories of how patrons got handsy with them, too. 

It's clear that you experienced it more in the chair than you did with the cane, so maybe there is something there. But mostly, I think it's drunk people being drunk. 

Petting is always a bit weird and annoying, definitely. The more ""usual"" stuff, I actually find less egregious than I would in other social situations where strangers feel it is okay to touch. Just the nature of the environment.

So definitely person-first.

Of course you can experience what I experienced when my employer changed my job description to include covering phones for the receptionist.  They did this  during my year long (I'm missing the word here) trial work period, (after a favorable evaluation, you are hired).  I tried to do it but I was horrible at it thanks to my severe hearing impairment. They also counted my absences and need to sometimes work different hours due to reoccurring appointments. This was a government agency and I went to HR about it. They told me a I was correct that it was wrong for them to dismiss me on those terms. However everyone hired that year was getting laid off over the next 6 months anyway, thanks to a recession.  So, they would not reverse the decision.  I remember being devastated.  


Disabled people also have the issue that it is difficult to prove you have been discriminated against in hiring decisions, as long as everyone says the right things. They can turn you down as a ""bad fit for their organization"".  You would have to prove that you were \*better\* than other applicants (not just equal to). So, you would have to have information about those applicants. I suppose you would do this by suing the organization?  


Anyway I just avoided jobs that had phone work as an actual part of the job description. Then, after being hired,  I simply told them I communicate best via email or messaging and that was my accommodation. I have to tell them during my interviews - because my hearing loss becomes apparent and I need to explain why I'm staring at them!",,,7,0,0,
783ed179-3c3d-4021-9c42-0b5c42188e9e,1575212653,"I saw a Reddit post about loneliness which I've been using, and I find it helpful:

Coping with Loneliness:

1. Wait it out till morning. It's always darkest before the dawn.

2. Get more certainty. Anxiety can amplify loneliness.

3. Be patient. Hedonic adaptation: with each new day, I feel a little bit better.

4. Other people's presence (or not) isn't what makes you feel lonely. Only changing your thinking can change your feelings! The scarcity mindset is an illusion. Trust in the abundance of nature.

I hope their list helps!

Some other information I got from a psych YouTube channel:

Loneliness makes you less likely to engage in healthy behavior (like working out or eating well.) Evolutionarily, loneliness is a signal to us that we're in danger. It used to be unsafe to be alone. Loneliness makes us on high alert, so we can get safe. Loneliness is a drive, like hunger or sex, to keep the body safe, happy, and healthy. Social isolation is distinct from loneliness. Social isolation makes us very comfortable in a known environment. Social isolation makes us more likely to view unknown social interactions as potentially threatening, which can make us not so nice to others, which then exacerbates loneliness. 

Embracing the unknown, and feeling content in yourself, are two action items you can practice every day to actively mitigate feelings of loneliness.

It's easy to say ""just make some friends"" but I know it isn't always that easy in practice. 

Remember, it takes months to find people you really gel with, and then years to form meaningful and stable relationships with them. And even then, not everyone out there is deserving of your friendship. ""It's better to have 4 quarters than a hundred pennies."" It's not going to happen overnight. I'm on a very similar journey. 

Good luck with your move!",,,3,1,0,

It’s great that you have found a Disability Representative!! You will need one because your daughter’s claim is tricky — that does not mean that your daughter can not win her claim for disability benefits. Your representative will work closely with you to develop a compelling legal theory that is supported by the evidence. 

Your daughter’s job sounds like a type of “sheltered work” which means that her coworkers and supervisor are aware of issues she may have on the job and they offer assistance in keeping her on task and may redirect her as needed during the workday. I would try to get a statement from her supervisor explaining any accommodations that they provide her during the day. This will be extremely helpful in building a claim for disability benefits. Very important — Be sure to print form SSA-795 and have the supervisor use that form to fill out the statement. 

I also want to point out that any applications for benefits before she turned 22 years old could be helpful in certain situations, such as: you or her father become/are disabled, you or her father pass away or you or her father are receiving Social Security Retirement benefits. This is important to remember because if criteria is met, your daughter may be able to draw benefits off of her parent’s earning record — which means a larger disability benefit for your daughter!

I have an actual bump/callous on the first knuckle of my ring finger on my right hand. Don't have it on the left.

I'm sure I could adjust if I did it enough but honestly it's not a big enough problem to bother with at this point. I've got bigger issues!

Drawing would be a whole 'nother thing though. I might try to adapt my grip.

It's hard, seriously hard to learn to disregard what people say, think or how they act around and to her. So that is the primary factor that needs addressing, either by professional help, or by you bolstering her self Confidence by telling her how much you see in her.

Here's the weird part. Whenever I think back to that time, I see Jess. You see, Jess is extroverted and likes to talk a lot and she can do presentations no problem. My brain sees that, takes it, and like...... photoshops my entire body out of it and put Jess's body instead.

The one thing that gives me pause in this discussion is access to resources for disabled people, which in the Uk (and the US, from what I hear) are already very stretched. I have a spinal cord injury, I’m partially paralysed below the waist and can not walk without crutches or a wheelchair. My life is a lot harder than it was before my injury and there are more invisible elements to my disability as well. But in terms of getting Personal Independence Payment (like disability payments in the US), it’s been decided that I’m essentially able-bodied for mobility purposes. (I’m appealing that decision on medical grounds, but it’s a long and exhausting process.) I have to say that I would feel really frustrated if someone chose to, for example, amputate both limbs and be in a wheelchair permanently and then started receiving full mobility payments because of a choice that they made. I realise that’s not very sympathetic of me, and it’s a problem with government funding of disability welfare programs rather than trans-abled people themselves, but I would still find that extremely frustrating given the number of additional expenses I have as a result of my own injury that I don’t have any help with.",,,8,0,0,

2b976389-ce4d-46ac-91c2-5591c71b5082,1577327641,"I've done it a few times (Australia -&gt; USA). The only bad part is flying and that is dependent on how mobile you are. Of course it also depends on where you are going, which will affect your transit experience and stuff too. Experience wherever you go should depend on the place and the things you want to do and the ways you intend to get around.

It's sort of like travelling with a wheelchair but much much easier (I think more advice online exists on airline sites for wheelchairs as it's the standard case) as you don't have to worry about a very expensive wheelchair getting messed up. However your walker can definitely get damaged or parts lost by poor handling. If it has separate parts like a basket, just don't bring them, I've had my rollator basket lost on domestic flights, international flights, etc. etc. it just seems to come loose in the cargo hold and never get back to me. The convenience of having the basket is not worth losing it over and over and having to replace it.

You should be able to check your walker (not counting against your baggage allowance) if you let the airline know in advance through the Accessibility Desk. You will need assistance to get to the plane and maybe to board because where you check your luggage is not the same as where you board, but airports have wheelchairs and staff who can wheel you there if you can't walk the long distances without your walker. If you're doing transfers that is where the difficulty comes in, sometimes I've had trouble ensuring it would be available when I landed and so I wouldn't be able to walk all the way through the airport safely, in which case they note that you need wheelchair assistance for the transfer, which is fairly reliable but can be nervewracking all the same and a lot of people need it, and having your travel out of your own hands can be awkward, I guess.

Not sure about putting the walker in the cargo hold or anything, I always check mine and just get wheelchair assistance in case it gets lost, which can be kind of scary sometimes because I've had staff forget about me, not know where I'm supposed to go, etc. and I have other disabilities that make it more complicated to get their attention.

TL;DR it's not very hard if you clarify with the airline in advance and make sure they have an accessibility policy that covers wheelchairs, because then you just get them to treat it like a wheelchair (in my experience), but sometimes things can go wrong with separate parts like baskets, and you might need wheelchair assistance in the airport which can be stressful.",,,9,0,0,

It's just that common. 

All of my friends were interested to learn about the past of the word and wanted to try to modify their speech, which was nice. Context and who is speaking to whom and for what purpose are all important. I would say that in general, for example, ""gimp,"" would be quite offensive to me, but there are some very close friends who are allowed to say it around/about me.

That, too, kinda brings me to another similar thought, that the arguments for and against a ban are, so far, inherently incompatible *to some degree*. The side for the ban is arguing for preserving the environment, while the side against the ban is arguing for many other things that aren't really about straws or eco-friendliness to begin with. It's not (exactly) ableist to be ""for a straw ban,"" it's ableist to be stingy and judgey about someone needing straws -- and other acomodations -- to function well in the environment. But the two are not exactly the same thing: a ban is pro-environment and rarely about society's behavior, and the no-ban is more about society's reactions to disability rather than about straws themselves. The behavior of those people who would be judgemental is ableist; the ""need"" to hide or not be accommodated for your disability is ableist; trying to limit eco-damaging items (be they bags, straws, cup lids, packaging, any of it) is not, *inherently* or *directly*, ableist. They can affect the disabled community and its population, but it's largely indirect in how it does so, and much of the way they do is because of society's poor views/reactions of disability.",,,1,0,0,

It wasn't that things were harder, it was just like my body was acting like they were. For example, I might break a glass by picking it up, or I might stick my tongue out while tying my shoes. I would sort of ""overshoot"" everything I did. I took note of this sometime in 2018, but I don't really know when it started.

My hands and feet also started going numb around this time, although not bad enough to worry. In April 2019, it became disabling, and it started spreading to my shoulders and neck. Nothing excruciating, but it was weird and didn't seem connected to my activities. Like, walking would cause pain in my arms and shoulders, and talking would cause a zapping sensation from my neck down to my arm.

Somewhere along the way, my memory got worse and I stopped being able to organize tasks. I think this might be coming back slowly, but I think it might be easier if it doesn't.

I didn't know you were so young. That's so much worse. I was 30 when it got really bad, so at least I could make jokes about it. Also, I'd already experienced disability, so I'd (mostly) stopped caring about what people think.

Still, a cane is sort of a spectacle at my age (31). It's more a symbol of aging than disability in most people's minds. A wheelchair, not so much, which might make you feel better.

Many people living solely on disability can afford food and electricity and such basics but go without things like cable or even internet sometimes.

Others on disability do struggle to make basic ends meet for food, shelter, clothing, and the like.

Before commenting, be sure to read, in detail, the [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/11/18/2019-24700/rules-regarding-the-frequency-and-notice-of-continuing-disability-reviews) and comment to the NPRM, basically telling the agency staff what you like or dislike in the proposed changes, in detail. Cite other documents, both those from the federal government and those that the staff may not be familiar with, such as academic papers.

This is not a matter of voting. A large number of comments saying ""I like/don't like the changes"" will do less good than a few well thought out comments that address the issues. They will be reviewed by ""thechnocrats"" who are moved by the detailed comments.

The comments may not have much effect immediately, but they will help when lawsuits are filed enforcing the Regulartory Procedures Act (RPA) and when future administrations (hopefully in a little over a year) work to overturn the current administration's deregulartory changes.

A physician may be able to document the things you cannot do, things you can do with assistance and things you can do on your own.

Title I of the ADA prohibits employers from discriminating against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. 

I strongly suggest you research your company's policy on the ADA and accomodations (it should be in the employee's handbook) and go from there.

I wouldn't recommend waterproof over trousers, they are too slippery and I always feel like I'm going to fall out of my chair.

I wear sorel boots with heat pads for my feet in them. They run off a USB pack that sits in the pocket on my backrest. Make sure your shoes are waterproof on the bottom. If any part of you gets wet you'll feel it. 

I have a (mock) down filled jacket that I wear if I'm going to be taking it on and off a lot. If I'm going to be outside for a long period of time, I have a wool great coat that completely covers me to my boots, but it takes a lot of energy to get it on and off so I avoid wearing where possible.

For gloves, I use thick leather gloves with a soft fabric lining. They will absorb quite a lot of water off the wheels and keep their grip. Leather will get a bit stiff once it has dried out, so that is why I prefer ones with a fabric liner.

It doesn't actually show heaps where I live, so something like wheelblades just aren't worth the expense, but a freewheel or frontwheel would be second best and works in the summer for off road too.

In terms of getting snow off your tyres, a stiff brush will work well, but only do it when you're inside. Snow sticks to snow better than rubber, so any snow in the tread of your tyres is going to give you better grip. Winter tyres on cars are designed to pick up snow for exactly that reason, so it you can find a similar tread pattern for your wheels then that might help.",,,1,0,0,

I find the straw ban to be fairly pointless in the scheme of things - when companies are still using plastic drink lids, the paper straws that McDonald's uses to replace plastic aren't recyclable (just as an example), and the majority of the plastic pollution in the ocean comes from fishing nets rather than consumer plastic waste. I don't feel strongly either way about a plastic straw ban (except that I think they should always be made available to those who need them) but I do feel like people have suddenly become obsessed with plastic straws in a way they aren't about other plastic waste and because of that they've been more likely to just dismiss disabled peoples' concerns out of hand without actually taking our stated needs into consideration (though like I say, I don't personally need plastic straws and rarely use straws at all, but I've heard from lots of others who do). 

In the UK, disposable carrier bags issued by the seven biggest supermarket chains have declined by 86% since the charge was introduced. If we can get a similar reduction in plastic straws, NOT replace them with straws that aren't recyclable like McDonald's, and also make sure that disabled people are accommodated, then that would be great. I'm just saying that I can see why it might feel like yet another pain in the ass thing about being disabled for those who do need them, but I'm sure not everyone feels that way!

VocRehab offices exist to help folks with diagnosed disabilities, as well as folks who receive SSI/SSDI/have a TTW. in other words, you don't need to have a TTW to work with a voc rehab office, so if the TTW program doesn't seem to fit your needs, the voc rehab office may also still be able to provide you with similar assistance.

your local voc rehab office is correct, in that TTW really is not for part-time work. however, the fact that you are a TTW holder should qualify you for voc rehab services regardless. perhaps they may be able to help you and provide similar assistance that you would seek through the TTW program.

in fact, when I used to work with TTW recipients, often they would have needs that went beyond what the Ticket program was able to offer, and in those cases, I would often refer them to the voc rehab office because they are often better funded and more capable of providing the various kinds of supports that are necessary for employment than what the TTW program may not provide or afford for.

don't forget, you can assign your TTW to any EN - they don't have to be a physical location that you can visit. Often, you can assign your Ticket to an EN across the country, as long as you are able to work together remotely in a way that you feel addresses your needs.",,,2,0,0,
ea1c8781-85bf-4b52-b098-0924ab4b6d6c,1576012193,"Okay, so in the interest of intellectual honesty, I’m gonna get a bit edgy here while I play devils advocate....
Isn’t it, though? 
In my experience I would say that the ideal for most (normal) people is that we (disabled people generally) don’t exist at all. Or at least are out of sight so that they don’t have to deal with our problems in any substantive manner. If you go back 100-200 years, this was the case even then, they’re just far less honest about it now. Back then odds are that you would either be locked at home away from regular people or in an asylum. Now, they just allow us out more but they fail still to treat us like actual people. 
Here’s an anecdotal example to show what I mean by that.
I’m an American, and I haven’t been anywhere else, so I can only speak from that perspective. I hope it’s different elsewhere but I don’t know.
Every time I look for a job, for instance, I run into some problems. If I get past the excuses of “we don’t have a hiring manager right now “ or “oh boy, I lost your application again” after they say “okay, we’ll call to set up an interview “ and actually get to the interview the first problem is prescribed medication. I now choose to use medical cannabis in lieu of anti spasm meds and pain killers. Regardless of what I use though I’m always refused on grounds of it being against policy because they would lose their drug free workplace credit and grant. I was even told by one employer to lie so they could keep the credit. The problem though is that in the event of me falling over or anything like that and getting hurt, I’d be drug tested, fired, and forced to pay their costs in doing so. 
But let’s assume I go with it.( Spoiler, tried this route, don’t recommend for the above reason)  Then I run into the second problem. Management. See, when I can’t do certain things like reach high shelves or lift very heavy objects from the ground into my lap (forgot to mention I’m wheelchair bound) they’ll get irritated, but they won’t actually address it. They just send my coworkers to tell me that management isn’t happy with me, and when I address it with management to ask what I can do better or differently they literally verbatim say,  “well, I don’t want to say anything discriminatory. Don’t worry about it, you’re doing fine.”
Eventually, whether it be through a drug test or making it so terrible I quit voluntarily, they’ll get rid of me. Usually before I’ve worked there over 6 months and never having worked more than 20 hours per week being part time.
   Now, I’ve also tried going to local places like headshops and dispensaries to avoid these problems, but the problem I find with those is that while it’d avoid the drug test issues they aren’t necessarily willing to remodel their building to be accessible being such a small business. I had one very honest guy say, “look man, I’m not trying to be a dick, but if someone who doesn’t need accommodations of any kind also applies then there’s no point to hiring you because you would just be an extra expense”. 
I can give many more examples of mine and others experience within the workplace , the education system and our various medical and insurance systems that clearly demonstrate that at least in terms of the system, we aren’t treated like people.
We’re treated as a source of income, for tax credits, hospitals, schools and insurance companies. When confronted, they won’t level with you as a human being for fear of losing those incentives or looking bad.
As I was saying before, I think people are a lot less honest about how they feel and what they want you to do about it. They are so unwilling to discuss solutions like voluntary suicide because they don’t want to be seen as saying “either take your ssi check and fuck off, or die.”  so things like this eugenics thing are their way of softening that.",,,5,0,0,

There was definite malpractice, too. I was medically and physically harmed. In addition to other things, I was nastily ejected from a hospital very, very ill, amidst being screamed at for ""faking"" a condition I've had and been hospitalized for since birth. I was admitted to the hospital because the ER saw an intestinal blockage on my CT (I have a witness) and out of the blue two weeks later my PCP called in two strong antibiotics, a month's worth, to treat the serious stomach infection that grew from the culture taken the day this doc ejected me with a 170/105 BP from being in so much pain. If that isn't bad enough, I was in the middle of chemo at the time for breast cancer. 

Obstruction on cat scan, serious stomach infection, lifetime of hospitalizations for stomach issues, in chemo, and he accused me of faking the stomach pain. He's very ""high up"" so no one will advocate for me. Even my PCP of 12 years fired me from his practice. 

If that isn't bad enough, he was so angry (about something he was dead wrong about) he accused me of being an opioid addict and doing it all for the drugs. Won't bore anyone with blatant proof that it's untrue; it is. I don't drink, smoke, or use any drugs, including most of the ""as needed"" drugs prescribed. I am so opposed to chemicals in my body that I see a pain management team at a different hospital because ""my"" team wanted me to wear a fentanyl patch 24/7/365 for a problem that only requires medication for a few days every six weeks. 

That happened in May and I've been begging anyone and everyone since to drug test me. No one will. One accusation is ruining my life and no one will do the only thing that would allow me to refute it. 

Anyway, I've been through hell since this all happened. No one will treat me. I've rolled around in hospital beds for 8, 10, 12 hours crying and sometimes delirious with pain. Pain management surgically implanted a device is my back (waistline, because my stomach - that I'm allegedly faking about -  is so bad they couldn't put it there like usual) so it hurts all the time. I can't wear jeans because it aggravates the site. I can't sit on straight back chairs because it hurts the skin it's pinching and the whole area it's pressing into. My husband forgets and rubs my back and I yelp. 

So instead of IV pain medication once every six weeks - the only thing that works - it's being continuously injected every single day (every nine minutes). We use a bolus to release a heavier amount when I'm in severe pain and 1. It doesn't work as well and 2. It makes me very, very sick. My level 7-8 pain drops to a 2-3 in the ER and I go home. This way, it drops to a 4 or so, but them I start vomiting, bringing out back up to a 6, and since it stays aggravated, it goes on for days. I'm also dehydrated, so I sip, which makes it hurt worse... just neverending cycle. 

It started Friday (the once every six weeks or so pain) my husband administered the bolus, and I've been on this cycle ever since. I'm going to be home, in pain, vomiting through Christmas, while the doctor who caused all of this enjoys his holidays with no repercussion whatsoever. 

Believe it or not that's only one of the times. I didn't write (yet) about the time I was at the ER during chemo and the nurse had me lie on the filthy waiting room floor for my turn. There eas also the time they literally forgot me in a room with no power, so dead cell phone and no call button. When I finally had to just go search for a bathroom a passed out in a nurse's arms in the hall. 

I could go on and on. I have been treated like absolute shit since that one doctor. I just want the black mark and the poor treatment to end. I'm way too sick way too often for it to keep going on like this. My daily doctors ask commiserate, but they're never on call when I'm in or at the hospital being treated like dirt. 

To fully paint the picture, I'm a sweet, plump,  frumpy 50YO woman who used to be a teacher. Picture grandma. There's nothing at all about my profile, actions, prescription history, anything, that supports any of this. There's 50 years of documentation of the illness that hit me approved for disability imm less than three months in thre first place. One asshole doctor was able to negate all of this during a hospital stay for a visible obstruction and resulting in antibiotics for a severe infection... simply by inexplicably calling me a faker and putting out on my charts.

As bad as all that is and as terrifying as my future now is, no lawyer is interested because there's no monetary damage. I don't work because of the lifelong condition that's required surgeries and NG tubes and such, but one man now says I have faked all that for 50 years and is able to do this much damage.",,,2,0,0,

I’m an incomplete paraplegic, and as a result of my spinal cord injury I now know dozens of paraplegics and tetraplegics whose injuries are more severe and have less chance of improvement than I do. Many of them used to have a lifetime award under the old system, but since the new system came in they now need to be reassessed every three years. These are people with complete spinal cord injuries, with no chance of natural improvement. The interview process is gruelling and often embarrassing, and not conducted by medical professionals (they’re outsourced to a private company). There’s such pressure not to award benefits that at the moment, 80% of appeals result in the initial being overturned. This means that people who get benefits are at a high risk of having them removed during that process, and given that disability benefit is not remotely a large sum here, that can be financially crippling. It’s a terrible system that causes unnecessary stress and financial hardship to some of the most vulnerable people in society. 

Meanwhile, welfare benefit fraud is the UK is estimated at £2bn (2% of all welfare benefits paid out, not just disability benefit). HMRC failed to collect £34bn of taxes that were due, with £5.2bn being attributed to tax evasion. The government set up a disability fraud hotline to allow the public to report disability fraud, and 280,000 (87% of all reports) were closed due to a lack of evidence.

In my area, only certain buses have them, and disabled people have to request to be put on the route for pickup. But, the assumption is that primarily people who might need a ramp or extra help are the ones getting on these buses. Do all of the buses in your city have ramps by default? Either way, I would think it is part of what the driver signed up for, in which case--although I really don't think it will get you anywhere--you could file a complaint. 

I've heard that if the bus driver has to get out or do literally anything extra, it can be a hassle for the disabled. That shouldn't make a difference, but people will go to great lengths to avoid any small inconvenience, even when it is supposed to come with the job.",,,1,0,0,

The big question is who can persuade Congress and the legislatures to pass legislation. Sanders might have the loudest voice, he might be the most animated, and might move his hands the fastest, but will he be the most able to persuade other elected officials to adopt his ideas?

The next Congress will be facing the largest deficit ever.

Are you sure that the numbers are correct that you would be allowed to make if you were awarded the SSDI? 

You do know that you can have a ""Trial Work Period"" of nine months after being awarded SSDI don't you? Here's the info about this : 

After you start receiving benefits, the rules change a bit as to whether you can work part time. For Social Security disability insurance (SSDI), technically the SGA limit still applies, but you have what's called a **trial work period**.. This is a nine-month period during which you can more than the SGA limit.

At the end of the trial period, you can either go back to work or by that time will be able to probably continue working as long as you don't make more than the amount specified that you are  allowed to make each month.

I would FIRST consult a Social Security Disability Attorney BEFORE I would take the work of a CPA, just to cover your tracks and make sure this is correct. You certainly don't want to lose the SSDI after waiting so long to get because someone has given you the ""wrong"" advice possibly.

Most of the ways to access nature require a car in the US. Our public transportation sucks in most cities and is non existent in smaller towns. I assume you are not from the US from your use of kilometres :)   


My wife and I used to tent camp at parks where you can pull your car right up to the area you are camping and you don't walk far at all.  I know you don't have a car so it would be harder for you to drag in everything you need to camp softly. Your area is large enough for essentials, usually enough room for 2 tents. There is usually a table and bench and fire circle. We used a blow up mattress rather than just sleeping bags. I knew I would pay a little later but we reduced the consequences. Our focus was on just enjoying nature from the camp spot. The only issue I had was that sometimes you have to park and camp a walk away from the bathrooms. Since we had a car we drove to and from the bathroom when we needed. So this is something you might aim for when one of you gets a licence :)

If she is into video games, I know there are adaptive controllers and games now a days. (Some you can use with one hand). It seems like younger folx are into Fortnite or Minecraft (I can't remember which is popular now). It might help to ask if she's into that and buy souvenirs related to that. 

Also, maybe a day at the movies. You could take her/ pay for her to have a great dinner somewhere she loves.  

If she doesn't have adaptive aids to help her dress, that's a practical gift. They make sticks to help you button clothes, put on pants, shoes, socks, e.t.c if you only have use of one arm, or cant bend etc. I know they come in handy.

My last thought is asking her which TV shows or movies she is really into. There are so many stuffed animals, trinkets, e.t.c related to stuff that's popular with young people. (She might have aged out of this, but I see Paw Patrol stuff everywhere I go). Spencer's, Barnes and Nobles, they tend to have cool stuff related to pop culture. 

Good luck!",,,3,0,0,

Even assuming your annual health costs are $20K, that leaves at a minimum $10K if you have a bad year where your dividends may out on the low end of the scale you listed. No, that is not much, but unfortunately, it is already more than the maximum SSI beneficiary makes annually.

It *is* still below poverty, but as you note, sometimes you make as much as $60K in a year.

Malpractice is very very fact specific and you must be harmed from it - financially harmed by a lawyer or physically harmed by a doctor. For legal malpractice it'd be things like missing filing deadlines, missing key merits of the case, taking a case you have no experience in (say a criminal defense lawyer taking a disability insurance lawsuit case). 

Medically you'd need to be harmed in some way that the doctor deviated from the standard of care. The “standard of care” is defined as what reasonably prudent medical provider would or would not have done under the same or similar circumstances. In essence, it boils down to whether the provider was negligent.

From your post it sounds like you're talking about discrimination. Discrimination is very hard to prove especially when you're seeking a lawyer/etc. I personally had five SSDI lawyers say ""You're too young to be disabled!"" to me until I found someone who had experience winning SSDI cases for sleep disorders and understood exactly what I was going through.

7bae72a9-5e38-43fc-b81f-877af4611209,1575915571,"I've used a chair for  little over 8 years and it really isn't as bad as many think.  There's some annoying stuff like accessibility etc but for the most part I love my chair.  



Its soooooo much easier to get around on wheels,  I don't hurt quite as badly and I'm not always absolutely exhausted and I'm not destroying the knees and butt of my trousers by needing to sit on the floor part way from the car to the shop etc,  having to butt shuffle in shop queues etc.


I've found my chair is a ton of fun and I've decided to view my chair as a child would- give the chair to a group of kids to play on for a little while and and watch their reaction.  They usually think it's the *best* toy and literally fight each other for a go. One kid at church told me he wanted a chair so he could play with it indoors cos he couldn't use his bike or scooter in any building and he really wanted to.  


So I think of my chair as the best toy that I can play in all day long, and can even play with it in areas where no bikes, scooters or roller skates are allowed.  



It took a good few months to get strong enough to be able to self propel myself without ending up in bushes at the sides of the road (or randomly ending up in people's front lawns with them looking at me like I'd lost the plot ��) but once I'd learned the coordination and how hard to push each arm I started having fun (and gotten my strength up so the shoulder dislocations (incl the left one that's been out since 2006) aren't as big a problem as my muscles can stabilise the head of my humerous if it's in or out of joint,  allowing me to use the arm relatively normally). I didn't trust myself to be able to stop until i was strong so didn't go down hills until I knew I was safe at the bottom. It was those first hills that made me truly believe that my chair was a lot of fun! I also adore shop flooring,  its like a racetrack and go to my local Tesco (24hr) at 2am so it'll be empty so I can zoom around the store at my full speed, doing ""handbrake"" turns at the end of each aisle. I go so fast that I slide sideways as i turn after locking my wheels with my hands ��.



Compared to life before my chair, my life is so.much.better . My life used to always be constant exhaustion and pain and I ended up housebound as I just couldn't get anywhere on my sticks without my body being done and making me black out. So my chair usage basically gave me my life back.  


And chair usage means I could go back to playing sports and having fun with my friends.  I play football,  cricket and frisby (uk football) with my friends in parks in the warmer months when we meet up and that means so much to me.  I used to not be able to meet up because the park was just too big for me to walk across (even if I parked my car right next to it) so being able to randomly join them and play with them and their kids etc makes me really happy. It also meant I was able to get back onto a badminton court and play,  and I had to quit when i was 12 due to back pains (and that really upset me as I loved it) so getting on the courts again in my 30s was a huge thing for me. I now have a tennis wheelchair that I use for badminton, hold my own against able bodied players at our club (that are pretty highly skilled) and compete in parabadminton. None of that would have been possible without my chair. 


And also,  it means I can pop to town for a coffee or can go to the library and choose a book all by myself. Stuff that I honestly never thought I'd be able to do again without a lot of help and someone strong enough to carry me if needed.  Now I can just go at a moment's notice,  or if a friend texts me saying she's unexpectedly in town  I can go and not make up an excuse that won't make people feel sorry for me. 



I put off my chair usage for years due to the stigma around them.  I wish i hadn't and ignored the stigma because my life is a whole world better due to it.  It kinda makes me feel a sense of freedom that I didn't expect to have.  



There are some annoying stuff, like I wad gonna be getting a Frontwheel attachment for Christmas so I could finally go on our family Christmas walk through fields (i had to wait until I got a new chair that is compatible to those kind of wheel attachments, I got the new chair this year) but problems with my footrest have meant I can't get it until it's fixed so I'm not gonna be able to go this year. But I *will* by next Christmas. And I'm not able to get into parts of my church as it's a listed building and they're not allowed to install a lift for me (but have factored me, and the other chair user, into the upcoming renovations so we'll be able to get down to the sacristy and the meeting rooms down there and will prioritise our use of those rooms over the others we can't get into).. some friend's homes are inaccessible and some shops have layouts that make it hard to move around it in my chair, the state of the pavements can make chair use awkward as can the lack of decent dropped kerbs etc etc.  But overall my life is a whole lot easier than it was before, even after taking the issues with chair use into account. 



At the end of the day,  a wheelchair is just like any other tool- built to be used when we need it.  So we shouldn't put it off if we need it,  due to the stigma. We wouldn't put off crutch use if we broke a leg, choosing to hop instead. And chairs are awesome fun.

I have sensory issues myself. You won’t know just based on the job description whether or not your sensory triggers will be there at your job. You might need to see the workspace beforehand. You can low-key ask for a tour of the workspace during the interview, while passing it off as interest in the job/company.

**And no, you do NOT need to admit to an employer in an interview that you are disabled and need dictation software.** Once you receive a job offer, you would go to HR and start an accommodation request. You will need a doctor’s note. One piece of software (or a special keyboard if it would help you) is incredibly mild as far as accommodations go, so if the company complains you just might want to consider running away from that job as fast as you can.

Personally, I find there are so many little annoying things about being disabled and things that I have to specially request, that it does add up to being a noticeable thing that drains me mentally. Like having to ask someone to move from the priority seat on the bus, to waiting for someone to unlock the disabled bathroom in public place, to having to ask and then wait for a ramp to be put down so I can access the same shop that other people just walk right into... it adds up. 

So I see it less as drawing attention to a disability and more as yet ANOTHER thing that I would have to specially request and then wait for the staff to go and get for me. And let's be honest, after a straw ban, there will be one dusty box of straws in the back of their supply room and no one will remember where it is and they might run out, and... yeah. For many disabled people, every little thing throughout the day is like that. Constantly having to ask and wait for stuff that non-disabled people take for granted. 

(Is that a reason not to have a straw ban? I can't say because it doesn't affect me so I don't really know the impact it would have. I'm just guessing based on my interaction with the world given the disability I do have.

I need to use the handicap space in a parking lot; I use a handicap placard. I will be this way for life. I park in a handicap space because I need to. The kind of car I drive, the clothes I wear, or the apartment I have has absolutely nothing to do with my disability.

Although it is technically true that money could be better spent on food, unless you have enough to cover the cost of tuition for your degree out of pocket, it is not necessarily an either-or proposition.

It is a risk if you have to take out a student loan to do it, but you may qualify for aid that provides grants and scholarships to cover the bulk of the cost. 

Your doctor appears to be talking about ""the money"" as though you have it already when I am guessing you don't.

2. Interior would be a removable lining pad, can choose between foam, cotton, or wool.   

3. There would be ""pockets"" embedded into the leather that would act as a phone holder, coin holder, or so on.

I got put away into group homes countless times because my old room mate was abusive. She would call the social worker if I was messy and claimed that my ""mental health was declining and I needed more support"". No! Im physically disabled. I can't keep up the same way an able bodied person would. Is my living space like hoarders? No! But, I'm not going to use my extremely limited energy to make my bed every day and scrub the floors of the bathroom daily. I also am generally in school, taking a thousand trainings a week, e.t.c. 

When I moved into my own apartment, my also disabled husband moved in with me. We are both messy because it's hard to clean when you are disabled. I could always move around my wheelchair and we never did anything wrong. 

The same old room mate came over in the middle of the night and told us we needed to go to the hospital because of it being messy. She was doing a ""wellness check"". Clearly, she said, we weren't taking care of ourselves. 

My husband at that point was working 16 hour days at a physical job he couldn't do long term. I had a freaking catheter and PICC line in and was bed bound. The state was not sending aides yet. 

I am 31 fucking years old. If I want to throw some socks on the floor, have a pile of dirty laundry, whatever, I can! I pay rent. As long as I'm not destroying property or drawing bugs or leaving like expired meat random places why does it matter?

Do we barge into able bodied peoples home and tell them they need to go to an institution if their house is messy? No.  They'd call the police. People infantalisize us so they think that they are helping us learn life skills or some bullshit. 

It really makes me so mad that people continue to do this. If someone is so concerned about my house being messy, they can come clean it daily. But, people just like to tell us to do things we physically cant do without offering help or solution from a problem they created.

aab4dedf-8534-4635-bf25-e8cc8d0fdea6,1577545847,"I can’t spend too much time on it due to a current and busy family vacation, but this is to scare people into thinking their benefits will terminate. Or to scare them from applying. Another person on a different sub mentioned their only option now was suicide since they think their benefits will be ceased. I have been doing CDR claims for 8 months now, receiving 4 PER WEEK. And let me tell you this, it is extremely difficult to cease someone. I have only had one case ceased, and that was because nobody could find her. We contacted SSA, who will send out investigators to claimants homes to see if they still live there. We only contact by mail and phone. And if you guessed that quite a few claimants phones are disconnected, you guessed correct. So our next step is to send someone to the listed address. She was not a resident there anymore and her phone was disconnected, so she could not attend the exam that was necessary. So she was ceased.  But that’s just an example from my caseload. SSA makes it very difficult to cease. We have to compare their last continuance/allowance to current evidence, and if they are showing the same symptoms, even if not as bad, they get continued. We have to submit a very good argument to say that someone needs to be ceased. 

But on the literal side of it, SSDI is what we know as title 2, where it’s based on what you’ve paid into the system. I’m a big believer in less taxing (I could actually make a living wage in my state capital if I wasn’t taxed as much), but this program helps those that actually pay into it. I think this program should not be touched. You should be entitled to what you put in. It’s a thing that has never made sense to me, but people have gotten fired for questioning things too much. I know this for a fact because it happened to someone I worked with. 

Now SSI, or title 16, is what this new change would affect more. It’s for those that have not contributed enough in taxes to qualify for SSDI, though sometimes they qualify for both. I can’t answer on why, the field offices handle the finance portion. But typically, SSI is a low amount, nothing near a living wage, though some make it off of it. We can only evaluate those claims from the date of file, so it’s more likely less records to review than title 2. 

The new change they are talking about applied to what we know as “diaries”. Which is a review time. They range from a few months, to a year, to 3 years, to 7 years. By policy, each claim is supposed to be reviews every 7 years if it gets that diary. Even for someone with ID and an FSIQ of 40 that might live in a vegetative state must be re-reviewed. Because that is how we catch fraudulent people, which can be on either type claim. If a child has a cochlear implant placed, they can be on disability for a year before they are either automatically ceased, or reviewed to make sure they work. I am not sure when the auto ceases happen, but I think in cases like that they do. Childhood ADHD allowances are supposed to be reviewed every 3 years. As an 11 year old will function differently than a 14 year old. Or a 6 year old to a 9 year old. But we are told to put someone I think 55+ on a 7 year diary, since their status typically won’t change. There are specific impairments that are expected to get better, which is where the 2 year diary would help. Such as organ transplants, where certain ones have warranted only a 1 year diary. 

The other things we were told to look for during CDRs is for technological improvements. Surgical procedures are changing, we are getting more innovative. Some things might be able to be fixed in our lifetime, such as my diagnosis of muscular dystrophy. If they can cure mine and my family’s disease, I would be happy to get a different type of job, than have to receive disability. But I am afraid that once I have children (symptoms exacerbate and don’t bounce back to before), I won’t be able to work any more and have to apply. There is nothing wrong with getting the help needed, it’s just not something I want to do. So I understand the fear of what is coming. But unless you think you have gotten astronomically better, you should be fine. There are always disability attorneys, or an appeal. Most of us are very compassionate and have a need to help people.

The reason I don't want expedited reinstatement is that I've spent the last 3 years working tirelessly at Amazon.  The difference in payout would be about $800 if I were approved based on my current condition.

It's so wrong that those of us that live on SSDI have to live like this. Try having a DH on SSDI and then get sick yourself.....WOW.....the only way I was able to get my SSDI was that 1. I had worked enough quarters to qualify. 2. My Dr. was the Cheif Neurosurgeon/Professor and Chair of Neurosurgery of a well-known large hospital in the Midwest. Without his assistance I would still be trying to work and killing myself doing it.

You're right, it isn't fair to your friend to have to do the things she has to to make ends meet. This country needs to STOP paying these Senators, Representatives,  Governors and the list goes on the $$ they do. These people that hold office should also have to pay for their health care. No longer does the average American worker get perks like paid medical insurance like we used to, so why should all these people that hold offices get things like this? 

I am so tired of hearing these Presidental Candidates stand up there and LIE to the people. It doesn't matter what political party they belong to, THEY all lie to you.....and it's wrong. I'm sorry, but if you are trying to get  disability you shouldn't have to worry about where your next meal is coming from NOR should you have to decide which medication to take THIS month because you can't afford it all.

It can be hard suddenly becoming aware of a change in a loved one, it can also be very hard being the loved one who is changing. I think the best gift you can give your father is to see his tremor as inconvenient but separate to who he is as a person. 

It took me a long time to get used to accepting help to do something I used to be able to accomplish alone but having my friends and family just treat it like it’s normal, occasionally humorous (I did accidentally flick a grilled baby octopus at a stranger in a restaurant once when my fork gave a very vigorous twitch, got him in the forehead too!) and quite inconvenient is bliss. My tremor just is what it is with no extra emotional strings. But no one asks me to carry their drinks which is an added bonus. 

I hope you have a good enough relationship with your father or someone else close so you can acknowledge that it can be rough on him and rough on you too. Also be aware that there are drugs and other treatments that can help some people and it may be good to look at options if your father hasn’t already.

I presume, then, you're also aware of the astronomical cost for Medicaid in many states...they take almost half your social security income as the monthly share of cost (SOC) based on a COLA of many years back. For example: here in California, staring Jan. 1, Medi-Cal's SOC will be $602 before any assistance kicks in. There are several states that have an updated SOC, where you are not charged any SOC below 1,300 or so. California's SOC is based on 1989's COLA of $600 per month, and has never been adjusted, not even once! Thus, those in most need of the assistance can least afford it...so rarely resort to using Medicaid. This seems to be the case with /most/ states--that they charge an absurdly high SOC--except those several states (such as New Mexico, Minnesota and Massachusetts). But these more reasonable states don't cover dental...at least, I know Minnesota doesn't.

So what good does expanded Medicaid do, when the SOC remains so exorbitant? Even though Medi-Cal resumed dental and other services (after more than a decade doing without) as a result of expanded Medicaid, it remains inaccessible. I am astounded that neither Democratic governor (Jerry Brown and Gavin Newsom) have not corrected this egregious denial of health care for the poor...ever since former governer, Arnold Schwartenegger, introduce this horrid SOC in 1989! 

I am also perturbed that this issue has remained ignored by the news, including the progressive outlets...nor can I find any movement or support group around this issue. And why the heck have no politicians addressed this, and challenged their state, whichever one that is, that charges a high SOC? I have emailed about this crude situation to over 20 of the most popular progressive, online news sites, and not one has ever responded. Same goes for politicians, including Nancy Pelosi. I've blogged about it, too, more than once. For example:

https://zekeblog.wordpress.com/2017/01/12/another-democrat-spreads-the-medicaid-lie/

I'd also like to remark that I see many people every day, wandering the streets or brooding alone on a street corner or in an alleyway, who are clearly eligible for SSI, SSDI, Medicaid and Medicare, yet they are ignored simply because they have no address.

I really think you don't understand the way disabilities affect every aspect if your life. The blind woman for example. She can't hold down a normal job anymore. Who should pay for her adjustments for work? Is it fair for a company, the government, her to have to pay it? How does she do her food shopping? Does she need a carer? What if she gets a guide dog? Should the charity be expected to treat her the same as other blind people?

I grew up caring for a paraplegic. She wasn't able to be independent despite remaining somewhat ambulatory. What happens when they become bed bound because of pressure sores? Who should pay for their care? Who pays for the treatments for the inevitable UTIs? Who should have to pay for physio? Catheters? It costs millions to care for and treat a paraplegic over a lifetime. Who should be made to foot the bill?

Don't try and compare disabilities. No disability is better or worse to have. I absolutely despise this culture of trying to decide who is worse off depending on their disability rather than trying to understand the struggles of each individual. Unless you have had severe dysphoria, been an amputee or been blind, don't try and compare them. Your views about disability are wildly simplistic.

The reason I plan to go into law school rather than continue with chemical engineering is, for the most part, due to my disability and being in a wheelchair. Most of the real work of a chemical engineer is sitting behind a desk working on a computer. I can do that well. However, what really interests me is the design of the process operation of chemical plants and refineries. That will involve going into plant control rooms and other parts of chemical plants. They are not accessible, and no one should go into a plant who cannot run in the case of a fire or explosion. I also cannot climb ladders. I used to love climbing around the equipment in a refinery.

As part of the environmental work I was doing, I worked for a lawyer who was helping us with regulatory matters, including some litigation. I was doing proofreading and legal research. I had done that kind of work before. After my accident, I decided to pursue what had become my second interest, law.",,,1,0,0,

It might help you to think about the situation in a more clinical way. You're getting an assistance that allows you a better education. Taking the bus (you don't do yourself any favors calling it the short bus) saves your family money and time and allows you to go to a school that provides you the support you need in math to be successful. You're not on the bus because your stupid or disabled or autistic. You're on the bus because it's a tool that helps you. 


Have you tried taking to any of the people you ride to school with? What are their names? What are they like? Are their any adults you could get to know on the bus? 

High school, which is the age range I'm assuming you're in, is where you put faces and real people to idea of disabilities you've heard of in your youth. You have the opportunity to see these people as real and human. This perspective will help you in your adult life to see the word more the way it is. Full of unique people with unique needs. 

Two more things. Ask your parents or counselor why you qualify for transportation. I think you might be getting that support because of the academic assistance you receive. If you didn't get that help you might not get transportation. How would things be different if you didn't go to the school you go to now?

Having a disability or an academic struggle is not a bad thing. It does not make you worth any less than anyone else you know. Worrying about what other people think of you because you ride on the stigmatized ""short bus"" does not make you a bad person either. 

If you're being bullied or teased for how you get to school you need to talk to an adult. It's not okay and it's not fair. Not to you: you haven't done anything wrong. And not to the kids you ride with. They shouldn't be used as an insult. 

School and how people think about you feels so important right now. That okay. It is, for now. But in a few years no one will remember how you used to get to school. No one with really care. 

Good on you for reaching out and asking for help. If theres more you need to think it talk through keep doing it. You could pm me if you want.",,,3,0,0,

There isn’t an easy answer for the straw debate because it is just a fraction of the actual issue facing society/the planet. There haven’t been significant resources put into affordable and accessible products that are also environmentally safe. Plastic is cheap which is why a lot of accessible products are made with it. Luckily the straw issue has raised awareness about how to make adequate products from better materials. Until that happens though there is no easy solution because each person needing a straw is going to have a different opinion for how they want to acquire said straw.

Need records/testing showing you continue to be disabled. 7 months is a long time so in theory you should have an established care plan of some kind. But you’re finding a new pcp so maybe it’s an insurance issue? 

Basically you don’t need to be completely bedridden or anything but you do need to have some kind of documented restriction or limitation that interferes with your specific occupation. So if you are a warehouse worker and you can’t lift over 20 pounds you’re disabled for own occupation but if you’re an accountant you wouldn’t be. 

If you have some kind of permanent issue then you can appeal and ask them to review the old medical and point it out to them. If it’s something that could have improved like general pain, broken bone, etc then yeah you need more medical.

The word began as a derogatory one.

Many humans suffered for its presence in our world.

Some humans died because of it, or because of how it allowed those to whom it was applied to suffer in ways that are not permitted in those we are eager to call ""human beings"".

Regardless how language may change over time, there will always be a human who remembers the history of the word. Just as there will always be human beings who, upon hearing the word, will have cause to wonder if they are now being targeted as some human beings were, evidenced by history.

Because I hold myself to be an ethical human being, one who does not partake in the practice of dehumanizing others, it is my obligation to focus and hone my thoughts and words and deeds to reflect this commitment in life.

To the extent that I have assessed and analyzed relevant history, I know the previously stated to be accurate. Because I wish to live in accord with my chosen ethics, I will not use language that deliberately seeks to dehumanize others.

I accept and admit that, because I AM a human being, I can and probably will be a complete hypocrite on occasion. I reserve the right of all human beings to be blind to inconsistencies, and I assert that it is the obligation of a free, open, and respectful public discourse to keep discussions LIKE THIS alive and thriving in the venues along which the public discourse proceeds.

In my opinion, your post is thoughtful and asks an important question. I have tried to focus my answer to deal with what I see as the fundamentals. I don't think banning words is the answer; I think offering insight and letting people decide for themselves is the way it should be... from there, groups will be groups and so long as no one starts altercations over it, this system can work well.

That said, I try never to use those words because I wouldn't want anyone who has suffered or known one who has suffered to think I am part of the group that derides others for their problems or is eager to dehumanize them in the name of societal expedience.",,,1,0,0,

I felt bad for them I didn't mean for the driver to kick them off but he actually didn't they chose. The driver got some amount of abuse from other passengers as they were leaving because of it. Even though the aunt was saying to me it's okay she was just stressed as she was a new mum and it'd probably do her good to walk for a bit of fresh air, her daughter one of the other people with buggy and she was perfectly okay about leaving.
I did say thank you to them when they left the bus, I had no idea what had gone one in the bus itself.

I also agree the chair could move more if you aren't in it. I know my chair specifically moves if I just lean to one side too much. But I also can completely understand the need to get out of the damned thing after a while if you can. I get soo motion sick some days I simply cannot go backwards, but in that case I can fold up my chair where I know many can't. But I see a lot struggle to stay in their chairs while in the bus also, I find it hard to stay sat up straight.

I use the bus often too only time I'd considered it was if I HAD to get the bus that was there then I could get on and fold it while on the bus and slide into a seat (it folds pretty well). Or when I was extremely nauseous and simply had to travel (I can't let people push me, often, because I get motion sick).

And yup I was more shocked at their response to the person transferring. It seems overly angry for someone just clearly wanting some relief from their wheelchair.

My mom was disabled for most of my childhood and she taught me not to help her unless she explicitly asked. In examples like yours, it can be dangerous to offer help without fully understanding the issue. Otherwise some people can be absolutely clueless and disrespectful in the kind of 'help' they offer. I've heard horror stories of people just shoving wheelchair bound people out of their way in the store, or randomly deciding to push them without asking. It's absolutely mindboggling to me. 

Now that I am facing my own disability/health issues, I like knowing that I can still do a few things on my own without needing help. I want to hold on to whatever independence I can while I can. But I also do my best to communicate how I'm feeling to my family so they know if they need to step in. It's about being able to communicate what I need to the people I know care about me most.

By getting out of it and onto a seat you would be taking up more space and preventing others from boarding ☺️ 

(Just playing devils advocate here) but in response to the wheelchairs only being crash tested to certain speeds, I would think it doesn’t make a difference wether you are sat in it, or on a seat. As the wheelchairs aren’t strapped in on a bus anyway they could move in the bus and hit you and other passengers in a collision - I was actually told they’re safer when we are sat in them as they’re more weighted and less likely to move. 

I take the bus a lot in my electric wheelchair and it’s never even occurred to me to get out of my wheelchair on the bus! Of course it’s all personal choice though, and nobody should feel they can tell disabled people how to live with their mobility aids!!",,,4,0,0,

If you hate green, that bright green color has got to go first thing. You want something that'll go with your outfits, something you can feel good about wearing. There are covers for bicycle helmets, mostly meant for high visibility, but it's gotta be the same principle--cover your helmet in some stretchy fabric, something that looks better than the 90s green you have now. If you still need high visibility, adding some bright-white reflective stripes might look much nicer than the green. I don't know if a bike helmet cover would actually work; it depends on the shape of the helmet; but if I was you I'd look into it, and if it doesn't work, then buy the fabric and pay somebody to sew it into shape for you, or sew it yourself if you've got the skills.

I ride the bus to and from work every day and I have for 5+ years, during which time I went from being a very able-bodied 18-year-old to being a disabled 23-year-old. My disability is invisible, and when the bus gets crowded, it becomes extremely uncomfortable.

I'm fortunate enough to live in a small city, it's also a place where lots of wealthier people are inhabiting most areas of the city now so public transit isn't that active. I'm grateful for the times when there's no one questioning me for taking a seat on the bus.

However, I live on the busiest line and there certainly are times when people look at me expectantly... And it's not like I never give up my seat, but usually if there are plenty of people who seem as though they could easily offer up their seats, I won't give up mine. I work full-time and this time of year especially the work is physical, and the walk to the bus station at the end of the day includes a steep incline that really hurts all those messed up clusters of nerves in my back.

I am lame, crippled, handicapped, or disabled. Both of my legs are smushed due to a drunk driver. I am in a wheelchair. I see nothing wrong with the terms ""lame"", ""crippled"", and ""handicapped"". Some terms like ""dumbwaiter"", when applied to the automatic lift device. When I referred to a waiter as dumb (not to his face but to others with me) after he really screwed up my order I meant it to be a slur.

I have referred to people (not to their faces but to others) as stupid or dumb when they repeatedly do stupid, dumb things. I have certainly used those words when referring to a certain well known elected official. However, in those cases, it is meant to be a slur and has nothing to do with disabilities.

However, I do not consider lame, crippled, or handicapped to be a slur when referring to those of us with mobility problems. I also have no problem with terms such as ""lame excuse"" or ""lame joke"". I tell lame jokes and make lame excuses myself. I recently told a guy who was asking me on a date that I did not want to go to a particular restaurant because it was not handicapped accessible. I then added, ""that was a lame excuse.""

I just flew in a plane for the first time since my disability got really severe (Neurological, need mobility aids, very very frequent fainting.) I got a ticket for a Disabled Passenger who requires an extra seat, so I can lay down and rest on the flight. The guy at the security line who scanned my ticket asked me what ""DXS"" means, as it was written on my ticket. I didn't know what it meant! It was awkward. An airline employee had to tell him it stood for ""Disabled Passenger, Xtra Seat."" It was slightly embarrassing but mostly because I felt ignorant, not because the guy was rude. Again, I'm sorry some people can be so hateful, cruel, or snide. It's a reflection on them, and has nothing do with you other than they think of you as an ""easy target."" Prove the jerks wrong! They're projecting their own self loathing, and it's disgusting. They suck.

I was SO ANXIOUS about the plane, about having to get the wheelchair at the airport, about making it through the security line without passing out, etc. I had my mom come with me and I made it to my destination without major incident. 

I feel like death on wheels, but I am traveling to see a specialist physician, so it's worth it imo. I don't know that  I could have done it alone. Will you have a travel buddy?

I have never needed it as I really really (uh, used to, I guess, sad face) love flying, but I'm considering asking my doctor for some anti anxiety meds for flying, as anxiety REALLY exacerbates my symptoms! So, Meds are another suggestion for you, not sure if it is a viable option.

0d96ee7e-ab4d-40be-b7dc-d3ff7e107daa,1577751991,"I think it’s important to remember that the majority of the words used to describe disabilities, are literally just adjectives. Words that have an individual meaning and hence can be applied to a multitude of situations! Phrases such as “*disable* the door” and “*crippling* blow” are accurately using these words for their descriptive purposes - which I see no problem with :) 

The only times I have an issue with this kind of behaviour are with phrases similar to “he’s such a *retard*”. In cases like this, the insult relates directly to the behaviour of those with that disability in a negative way, which isn’t acceptable to most.

It really can be a bit of a minefield, but my general take is that as long as someone doesn’t have malicious intent, there’s no harm done, though if they are open to it, taking the time to explain the negative connotations can be a really wholesome experience ☺️",,,3,0,0,

at the end of the day, I would assume that there would be minimal to no repercussions to your benefits -IF- you chose to use the Ticket program to get training and then used your training elsewhere - AS LONG AS you are able to carefully monitor your earnings and trial work period over time, and report all of your earnings to SSA.",,,2,0,0,

You'll need to base your answers to their questions off of what's she's like during an episode. I would also suggest hiring a lawyer if she is denied first round. This would also Grant her Medicaid, and eventually Medicare.

Aside from that, she and you should speak with her treatment team about what opportunities they see for her. If she can attend classes online with support from the college disability office, a degree could open up work from home opportunities and other more flexible arrangements. You're right that an employer generally will not want to hire a new unproven employee who is likely to have attendance issues, but some are more understanding than others. Your locale might have a job placement assistance program that helps people with disabilities find jobs and companies that fit their needs. 

I do want to say that if she's applying for SSI or SSDI, she should not work during that time frame. It can be a barrier to approval. It just isn't the time to test any theories.

When discussing ableism, OP, you might want to consider the framing of the discussion. By putting ableist in quotations, you’re kind of broadcasting that you think those words can’t possibly be slurs.  Able-bodied people don’t get a say in what is or isn’t considered ableist. Disabled people do, as we are the ones targeted by those words. If you call things “lame” to mean “bad”, there are going to be disabled people who you are hurting. Not all, because all disabled people are different we don’t all feel the same way—but you will definitely be hurting some disabled people. 

So the real question is whether or not using these words because you, a non-disabled person, don’t find them offensive is more important than the disabled people who do feel targeted and marginalized by that kind of language.

Have you looked into this from the local level?

I'm sure that you've given it consideration, but finding new employment is probably your best bet.  While you could press this legally as a violation of your civil rights (you might want to talk to the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission](https://www.eeoc.gov/)), it might be better to, for the time-being, move on, if for nothing more than some calming peace of mind.

I came across [this organization](https://www.wearecapable.org/), called Chronically Capable, that helps people w/ disabilities find jobs and/or careers.  Since you have a good deal of experience, you're probably better positioned than most to find work.  I would suggest searching their employment listings.  They seem to be updated regularly, including many jobs that can be held remotely.

It pains me to read your last paragraph.  Minority groups that discriminate against other minority groups are, in my estimation, the absolute *worst*.  Of all the people that should know better, it's them.  If I were you, I would strongly consider speaking to an attorney about your civil rights violation.  While they may not have to comply w/ federal law, they can't treat you differently or maliciously due to your disability.  Then, after securing employment elsewhere, I would very strongly consider outing this organization publicly.  While they may have occupied an incredibly important space in the LGBTQ+-feminist workspace, this is clearly no longer the case.  People that are doing worthwhile works for some, while hurting others should not get the benefit of the doubt, and there should be severe repercussions for their actions.  Allowing them to continue on in this manner only helps cement a culture of intolerance, and we can see where that's gotten us.

First things first, if you don’t have a clothes guard on your wheelchair, you absolutely need to get one. No more worrying about jackets and skirts getting caught in your wheels! 

High-waisted pants are my go-to because they won’t ride down while I’m sitting, cinched shirts/dresses to accentuate your waist - drawing attention to your waist makes a big difference, and you want to make your torso look long and smooth. Shapewear WILL be your best friend to hide all those lumps and bumps from sitting (in my experience at least - i’m pretty lumpy) 

You want your shirts to be longer than you think and your jackets to be shorter.

Go all-out with the shoes, maybe play with some bright &amp; funky leggings. When people look at me, the first thing they look at is usually my chair, my face, and then my legs, to see what’s wrong with them. I like throwing them off with some kickass shoes for when they inevitably look. So I try to play up those parts - my feet with nice shoes (that i can never wear unless i’m in my chair so might as well make use of them), my head (nice earrings, do your hair, makeup), and waist (belt, high waisted skirt/pants, belt to smooth everything out and draw more attention to my waist). 

Also I absolutely hate pencil skirts but I will admit it’s basically the only thing that looks good in a chair. It gives my shape a nice line, if that makes sense? You want to limit the bulky fabric that will make you look bigger and lumpier and just lose your whole shape in the fabric. Also because the chair already makes your presence physically take up more space, so you want to limit how much space you’re taking in the chair itself and go with more fitted clothes.

I have cerebral palsy, and am non-verbal, in a power wheelchair and can only use my right hand.

I could go on. I don't want to go through that again. As for working, it can be tricky, because of our income and bank account limitations.

As u/chemicalrefugee said, feelings like these are normal. For the most part, I'm okay emotionally, but every so often, I get frustrated with my disability when I see friends do \[this\], \[that\] and \[the other thing\]. My chair hinders me from traveling and even hanging out with friends because the location isn't accessible. In addition, due to the fact that I'm non-verbal, I really can't talk on the phone or on Discord. For me to do that, I have to use AAC/text-to-speech on my tablet. I know that doesn't sound so bad, and really it isn't, but when everyone can say what they want and you have to type everything out, it can be really frustrating. Let's be honest, people, in general, are not patient.

I make a little bit of money on Twitch (not a lot), although I do still struggle/get frustrated with my lack of viewers sometimes.

I also talked to my close friends and partner about worst-case scenarios, asking for support if those scenarios would happen.

I did the same w/ a couple of Ws on my transcript from years before, retaking the courses to replace the Ws.  However, if you decide not to retake any of the courses you were just forced to drop, you might do well to look into Academic Renewal and/or Progress Renewal.  

Progress Renewal allowed a student to replace Withdrawal (W), No Credit (NC), Incomplete (I), and No Pass (NP) grades from a transcript, w/out having to take those courses again, as long as a certain amount of time had passed (three semesters, if I recall correctly) and whatever other courses taken during that resultant period were passed w/ at least a 2.0 GPA.

Academic Renewal, on the other hand, allowed a student to replace D and F grades from a transcript, as long as the student had not attempted to again take the same course.  The above rules also applied to Academic Renewal, and while the D and/or F grades were not removed from the student's transcript, they were no longer factored into the student's GPA.  Additionally, the matriculation agreements between my junior college and the four-year universities they partnered w/ stipulated that any four-year school the student applied to agreed to not consider these D and/or F grades, if the Academic Renewal process had been completed.  I don't know if any of  this applies to you, but if it does, it's certainly worth looking into.

Her mum was telling me that they wanted to decorate her chair so she feels more confident in it when she starts her new school next year and I showed them a few types of ways you can customise chairs! She had solid wheels so I suggested getting rim covers and painting them with chalkboard paint so her and her friends can draw all over them whenever she likes, she said it’ll be more of a mainstream school with extra supports for her so i thought making something interactive would also help make other children more open to seeing wheelchairs and normalising them as just another part of her! 

Totally word vomited sorry it’s been a massive day but seeing her already had me on the edge of tears because I felt like one : I wasn’t a good example to look up at when it comes to being disabled as I always feel like “oh I’m not that bad if I can walk..”

 Before commenting, be sure to read, in detail, the [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/11/18/2019-24700/rules-regarding-the-frequency-and-notice-of-continuing-disability-reviews) and comment to the NPRM, basically telling the agency staff what you like or dislike in the proposed changes, in detail. Cite other documents, both those from the federal government and those that the staff may not be familiar with, such as academic papers.

This is not a matter of voting. A large number of comments saying ""I like/don't like the changes"" will do less good than a few well thought out comments that address the issues. They will be reviewed by ""thechnocrats"" who are moved by the detailed comments.

The comments may not have much effect immediately, but they will help when lawsuits are filed enforcing the Regulatory Procedures Act (RPA) and when future administrations (hopefully in a little over a year) work to overturn the current administration's deregulatory changes.

In relationships, understanding is important, but empathy is key. I married a man with multiple brain injuries, thinking that he would sympathize with my fluctuating energy levels and social awkwardness. He tried, but it was a daily struggle for both of us. When my mobility started going, I got the boot. Of course, he still makes a big show of being progressive and enlightened.

Now, I'm with someone who has never experienced disability, has *no* clue what I'm going through, and is probably in for a rude awakening one of these days. However, he's been kind and patient so far, because that's what you do when you've chosen a disabled person as your partner.

I don't know anything about your boyfriend or your relationship, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. But I can  say that other people don't decide what you can or cannot do. They don't decide when it's okay to sit and when it's okay to stand. They certainly can't tell you when you're tired and when you're not. If he's putting the burden of proof on you when you say you can't do something, he's actually encouraging you to exaggerate. That's the WORST thing a caregiver can do when they're already feeling overwhelmed.

Disability is not a difficult concept. When people choose to see laziness and malingering everywhere, they make it difficult.

9d852f05-d852-4ebb-8826-959ce28dcaf6,1577131743,"SSI - Yes. What they give you is based on need. So if you sell something, gifts, donations, spouses income, help from family or organizations (even if that’s to pay bills or food), really any money or assets available to you. They’ll ask you what assets you have and why you haven’t sold them. You are allowed to have a savings of $2,000 (more if married) or, you might need to double check, I believe ABLE accounts through SS will allow you to save more.

SSDI - No. You receive SSDI if you’ve put in enough work credits/taxes to receive disability. This is only based on your work income. So you can have investments, property, assets, gifts, donations a savings, etc. These are considered “unearned” income. You’re earned income is any payment you received from work labor and can earn up to ~$1,200 (single, married is higher) a month without it effecting you’re benefits. 

-

As someone who was born disabled and has had both. It’s kind of a broken system. If you can’t work because of childhood disability (or never worked prior to becoming disabled), you’re stuck. It’s already difficult to find a stable job because disability, options, and current economic state. I felt SSI was sometimes unreliable. The computers usually miscalculate and give you too much, which you have to pay back. Not only that but it’s retro payment. So what you get this month is based on your income last month. If you work hourly and don’t work the holiday or because of illness, you won’t see that benefit income until next month. Feels like being punished for something you can’t control and didn’t asked for. You can’t work and you have to sell anything you can. Can’t even have a savings. Forget about marriage equality for disabled folk. If you get married, most likely, your only source of independent income is taken away because your SOs income effects it. If you do work, they’ll sometimes write off things (reimburse partial amount) you need to “get to work;” a mobility aid, specific adaptations to your home, gas. If you’re self-employed, I /think/ , they will write off your materials; canvas, brushes, paint. As long as you need those things to then sell, therefore make an income. Some things they didn’t though, accommodations needed at your work, car maintenance, car payments, etc. (if I remember correctly.) This is all if you are able to work of course. Talk to your case worker and keep your receipts! There are some programs that will help you find a job/pay for work needs (clothes, accommodations, gas) like Ticket-to-Work.

SSDI is the better option of the two. At least you can have a savings, assets, dual income, without it being effected. This is all contingent on the fact that you have worked in the past and given into the system. What they do give you is barely minimum wage for a part time job. At least last I calculated, though, they are still garnishing a small amount to pay off my debt from miscalculations when I was on SSI. It’s stable and you can make more but there’s still a cap. I’ve been advised by multiple case workers to “not work anymore than I am” or the full amount of benefits will be stopped. Even if it’s $25 one month. This means I can’t take an odd job or freelance gig if offered. My options are to stay on it and not try and progress in work or find a stable part time job that I am capable and qualified of working that will pay me equal to or greater than what they give me. Sooo don’t try to be a contributing member of society and work towards independence?; got it. 

Rant. Rant. Rant.

It’s a confusing system that we have to rely on to survive. I found that finding straight forward, comprehensive information was difficult with the literature they give you; The Red Book. I learned that the best way to understand it is asking your case worker or someone who’s navigated it before. I didn’t find out about a lot of benefits I could have been utilizing until after I was off SSI. If you have any questions, let me know. I’ll do my best to help guide.

A serious question if you really believed that disabled/handicapped people are more determined.  Because it sounded like a poor argument.  So no attitude or anger, just curiosity, just curious what someone else thought, ya know?  But the direction you took it was far beyond what the question was, really no need to try to be existential there.  Probably something that was just a translation issue on a sign you turned into some response about being angry, ignorance, needing to have compassion, and steering into other existential garbage.

For many, they think that using a chair means you're stuck, trapped, or confined by the chair. I'm not assuming your GF feels that way, but it's possible, especially if she only started using one recently. Here's my tip: 
- acknowledge that there are real barriers for people who use chairs. Stairs are a thing, lack of elevators is a thing, small spaces that don't allow chair movement is a thing. These are real barriers, they're not her fault, and they suck. She and every other mobility aid user deserve better. The world could and should be designed to be universally accessible. Validate her complaints that *lack of accessability* sucks and is wrong. 
- remind her (without talking down) that her chair lets her have a level of freedom she wouldn't have if she had to walk everywhere. Her chair is her access to the world when her legs won't carry her. If you've noticed that she seems to have less pain or seems to be in a better mood when she's able to get around in the chair instead of walking, be honest with her about that and let her know that you don't care either way, you just want her to be happy and comfortable
- ask her if there's anything you can do to help her feel better about the situation, and offer to help her search for further support if she needs it. For example, a therapist, a support group (either for her disability, chronic pain, or for chair users), or an activity group (like wheelchair outing groups or disability discussion groups)

For example, if you have trouble typing because of a hand condition, you could deduct voice-to-text software expenses that allows you to speak rather than type. 

Your CPA is incorrect for disability purposes. SSA has a special set of rules that must be followed for self-employed individuals. SSA has a three step test to determine if you are earning SGA or if your worth of work is equivalent to SGA. 

You really need to think about your ability to sustain the part-time work. Do you think you could do this work reliably on a sustained basis? Is the part-time work dependable? Is there any part of your condition that would make it difficult for you to meet deadlines? 

Getting a job is hard - keeping a job is harder. 

If you decide to try the part-time work, you need to report the work to SSA because they can run a new-hire query. 

There are ways to work while receiving benefits. Just make sure that you notify, report and retain your work related documents. Maintaining a spreadsheet is the best way to prevent problems. Create a spreadsheet (or any document) with the time, the date, the full name of the SSA person that you are speaking with, the nature of the call, and the outcome of the call.

If a surgeon were to operate, and ultimately kill an otherwise physically healthy patient, they would face charges of negligence so they simply wouldn't do it. If the person wasn't happy with the results then they could sue. I wasn't saying that BIID didn't have comorbidities of depression or suicidal ideation, just that a surgeon is extremely unlikely to treat a mental illness by giving them a permanent disability because of the very likely complications that come with it.

You might be happy for resources to be used in that way, but you must be able to see that for people who are having their care hours cut, who are having to fund mobility equipment themselves or having to fight for years to receive state benefits, it might feel like a bit of a slap in the face for someone to inflict an injury on themselves and expect to have a cut of the resources.

Psychological disabilities can be just as disabling as physical ones. The key to treating any illness is to understand the underlying mechanisms and that isn't something that has been done for BIID. It is poorly understood and no real treatment for it exists right now, but I think it would be far better to advocate for research into the condition and possible treatments before permanently disabling people first.

I was 26 and didn't have anything in the bluebook, what I did have: hundreds of doctors notes and letters from doctors and former co-workers/friends who witnessed me struggle.  I got a fully favorable decision in March 2019. No lawyer, first try, no hearing.

It can be anxiety provoking so you really have to try not to entertain the gravity of it all. Apply once and see - then if you get denied you can decide if you want to continue with a lawyer, but it doesn't hurt to just fill out an application and wait a year, especially if  that could mean something positive. 

You can make an appointment at your local social security office and they can help you fill out the form, or you can apply online or over the phone. They'll send you some papers asking how you do daily tasks and what doctors you've seen, and from there it's pretty much no communication with you until a decision is made. Sometimes they send you to a doctor that they pay for when it gets close to decision time. And you are always able to send in more supporting evidence in your own. I sent in my own online research about my condition and pointed out everything that happens to me from that. I sent in statistics about how many people are totally debilitated by my condition. 

It exists for this reason: you cannot hold a job because of your disability. You have tried multiple jobs and still aren't able to perform the duties required. If there is nothing you can do to truly make a living without leaving you debilitated, you should apply. You have to prove this is something that will last more than 12 months and you have to prove you can't do anything else to support yourself, like another sedentary job.

My mother is disabled to the point where doing simple tasks can be thoroughly exhausting for her, and even simply walking can leave her in pain and catching her breath. I'm also heavily disabled, at least to the point where I sometimes need help sitting up from being asleep, and I'm confined to a wheelchair. My dad somehow still manages to be there for both of us, going to work for 8 hours a day for 4-5 days a week, then coming home to do most of the chores, like feeding the cats and washing clothes. Mom's only really able to cook dinner and occasionally load the dishwasher.

Yes, Dad gets really stressed about all he has to do sometimes, and at his age and mine (53 and 21, respectively), he shouldn't be having to take care of both me and Mom, but he still manages to do it and treat us like human beings at the same time. He's never expressed a desire to leave, or made us feel like we shouldnt exist. I know some people aren't strong enough to coexist with disabled people, but honestly, if my dad, who works in construction as a contractor then comes home to pretty much keep working, can do it, then someone more independent and young shouldnt have any real trouble. But of course, most people are too weak-willed to actually do it. If they don't want to be with someone who's disabled, and excuse my vulgarity here, then they can just fuck right off, in my honest opinion. We deserve love and acceptance just as much as they do, damn it.

We know only have one vehicle (second one we let someone borrow and they rolled it ten times off the side of a highway drunk) so I can only get out of the house on the wife's days off now.  Being such in this house day after day doing the same thing day after day can start to drive you a bit crazy at times.

We have a house full of dogs (5 of them) and help with rescued puppies which does help give me some companionship while she's at work and something to do, but it doesn't really take the place of being able to have conversations with co-workers or other people in day to day life.

That post seemed to indicate the primary reason you didn't pursue those avenues was that you felt like maybe they wouldn't get you or something. Or, that's how I read it. Maybe you just weren't into any of those people, that's valid too. 

My point about ""real or imagined"" is that it seems, just based on the posts you've made here and the very little information I have, that people who are not that different seem to get you enough to want to date you, and more than one person has been like that, according to you. 

I want to restrict my post to just potential romance since that is the focus of your topic, so maybe there is a huge group of non-romance related people that don't get you, and the primary driver of that is your impairment--I am not sure. So when I say ""imagined,"" it isn't necessarily to dismiss that people might not be ""getting"" you. It is simply to say that, again, based only on what you've provided here, it seems like people seem to get you a lot more than the amount of acceptance, particularly romantic acceptance, that truly disabled people face.

It hurts me to see him working so hard so we can get ahead finally. I feel useless and powerless a lot of the time. He is so loving and encouraged me to follow my dream of writing, photography, e.t.c. He has been driving semi trucks for 3 years so he's used to the grind. He just wants me to relax and be happy. But I get so mad at myself, feeling like I'm not ""pulling my weight"". 

I try to spend time looking at what I'm grateful for. It's easy to get bogged down if you don't. Without my husband, I would've been dead a long time ago, and that's the greatest gift I get every day. I get to enjoy the USA with him, not answer to anyone, do what I want, buy what I want, e.t.c. It's really freeing to pick what you want to eat every day, we are buying private insurance, etc. So many wonderful things that are easy to forget. 

I can feel you about being self driven. When I was 18, I got my EMT-B license so I could have a career and leave my childhood of poverty behind. I finished with a perfect score in everything and landed a job at the largest university hospital in Philly within a month. It was sad graduating alone, knowing that my family wouldn't see my accomplishments, and also, just didn't care. Unfortunately, my disability went into full flare mode a few months into my career, and that was it. 

When I speak to my dad now, it's so painful. He and my brother are my only living relatives. My dad is dying, and all he does is brag about the expensive house he and his wife and their step kids live in, all of the expensive places they've been, all of the stuff they do with my great aunts money and other family money. He brags about his sister's expensive house, my brother's house and Cadillac. My husband almost punched him through the phone when I had him on speaker. My dad mentioned they were going to court for my aunt's gold coins, I mentioned they were originally in my name, and he told me they weren't and him and his sister were splitting everything. My dad has never gotten me anything/acknowledged birthdays,  Christmas, any of my academic accomplishments, nada. He just talks about himself, brags about all of the things he has, and ignores that he created me, and I have needs with him as a father that have never, ever been met. Not just money, but support, love, an interest in my life and my goals.  He raises his new wife's kids and grandkids, but just refuses to be a father to me. 

It's infuriating and painful at minimum. I really don't understand my biological family. All I can do is look forward to the life my husband and I are creating. I am so blessed, he is an angel, and at the end of the day, he has proven over and over that he has my back no matter what. Same for me to him. It's always my hope that people who've had it rough find solace in another person in the way we do each other if someone wants that. It's the most beautiful thing to see the love in his eyes towards me 24/7. I never thought I'd find it, but here he is. I've never had anyone look at me the way he does. I'm so fucking lucky that I get to sign a marriage license with him, legally, in a few weeks.

I had met with a neurosurgeon to discuss a conference we were organizing together and she stopped the meeting because I was freaking her out. People usually only blow a pupil when they are near death...or touched their eye after touching a scopolamine patch, which I was using to dry to get rid of the nausea.

To answer your questions:

1. If you live in the U.S., and your STD program is regulated under ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974), you'll have to appeal before a lawsuit is even an option.

2. It's absolutely worth it. The worst thing they can do is deny you again, and if that's going to happen, you'll want to get it over with. Also, denying you LTD because you were terminated defeats the purpose of LTD. Not that they won't try, but I imagine it wouldn't hurt your case. As for return to work date, I'm not sure.

3. I don't feel confident answering this. If there's no preexisting condition clause, I imagine it would be fine, but I'm not sure why it's necessary. At the very least, get copies of these records. When I'm gathering documentation for a case or appeal, I always fax it myself just to make sure.

If we're all too disabled to work full-time but can patch together 20 hours a month here or there, I get it. My confusion is the ultimate assumption that some can manage 10 hours a month and some can manage 40 hours a month, but neither of these timeframes are based in any way on ability to work. 

If I can work 10 hours a month and someone else can work 40, it should only be because of severity of disability. Not because of whatever we do for a living. 

Once on SSDI, our hourly rate determines how much someone is still able to work, not our level of disability. Someone isn't magically able to work more because they get paid less. 

Just seems apples and oranges. Let's say a brain surgeon and a cashier have the same exact condition with the same exact limitations... but if the former works 20 hours while the latter works 40, that makes the person able to work less not disabled while the person who is able to work more still is? That's obviously backwards, but making income the determinant, that's the way it is.

There are a few ways I deal with them if the polite  request is ignored or overtly refused (so not when they say the ramp is broken).

1) I give a brief explanation of why I made the request but with a slightly more assertive tone, not enough to be rude but enough to let them know I'm not happy. Sometimes I sight the Equality act, but that depends on the drivers reaction. 

2) if the first way fails I follow the bus companies complaints procedure (just remember to make a note of the time, name of bus stop and number of service).

Sometimes with the complaints I take a leaf out of the Karen book and ask for the drivers name so that I can complain but this I use sparingly. Sometimes they realise why I'm asking and they get the ramp out but not always. 

3) I have also sent information about this to my MP and she was very helpful. In my area the bus drivers are notorious for making passengers get the ramp out and put it away. Obviously they shouldn't be doing this as you have to be trained. The MP spoke with the local council and they threatened to pull the school contracts.

During the first couple of years of my first serious relationship, it was hard for my s/o to do this because her approach to going out and doing stuff was just so different from mine. 

I don't know how long your girlfriend has been disabled, but it may still just take some time for her to come to terms, as it were. I was born this way and have had my whole life for disabled to simply be my normal, and I still find myself wishing for impossible things. I've said before that I think in some ways, it is harder to be disabled later in life, knowing what you lost. Depending on the timeline, just your general support and love perhaps is all that is needed right now. 

Talking about things you can do together and making plans may help a lot. More than that, being as much a ""normal couple"" as you can be when out and about will also help. By which I just mean chatting and hand-holding and all that. From experience, I can say that cane users can do much of what the typical normal couple stuff is. 

In addition to that, does she have interests that she used to enjoy before becoming disabled that she can still? I never got into clubs much since I could never dance or move like other people. But maybe she likes clubs. Totally you can still go to a club and if you're there together, have some fun. It won't be exactly the same, and of course there is a chance that she might feel a bit ""bad"" that it isn't how it was (just using the club as an example) but you can also help to show her how she can still enjoy things she likes, and perhaps enjoy them in slightly different ways. 

One of the biggest things is having a special someone who is willing to show how much one cares, and it seems she's already got that. :)",,,6,0,0,

I don't know that breaking up with someone when they get sick is inherently bad. It certainly looks bad, but it may be for the best in some circumstances.

e86e53b3-5fa0-4668-9b2f-c78fdab8af31,1575705306,"The post was about a video made by a disabled content creator who was responding to the oft made comment that “real disabled people must be so offended by BIID”. Well that disabled person is not offended by it, and she explained why. And able-bodied people assuming how disabled people are supposed to feel about something - that is offensive. So the initial post does seem particularly relevant to the subreddit. 

Of course the thread went off in different directions, but very interesting ones nonetheless, including some people saying mental conditions are not as disabling as physical conditions. That’s a very interesting discussion to be had, especially by people who have physical or mental disabilities or both. 

Back to body integrity dysphoria (BID). The ICD-11 does not explicitly say it is psychological. In fact, it avoids saying whether it is psychological or neurological or some combination or something else. Body integrity dysphoria is in the section “Mental or behavioral or neurodevelopmental disorders” along with many disorders that are commonly considered disabling. Does that make BID a disability - no. Can BID be considered a disability? That’s an interesting discussion to be had. Many people who have it experience it as disabling. And many people who have it are already disabled by other conditions. In any case BID/BIID is a condition that has a tremendous impact on the lives of people who have it and leads to disability (and occasionally death). It also sparks interesting discussions.

I hope that sort of answers your question “Why do you believe that discussions of people who are not disabled but either striving or claiming to be will benefit this community and not be detrimental?” And a question for you - do you think disabled people discussing BID/BIID is detrimental?",,,2,0,0,

Edit: literally all I'm saying is that no matter who trains the dog it should be required to behave appropriately in public and be able to pass a public access test. That is seriously not asking that much. And it's not beyond the grasp of an owner to train a dog to do. It truly isnt that hard. It just takes time, effort, and a dog who has the natural capability to do so. This is really something pretty much any owner who cares enough to put in the work can do, as long as the dog is capable/willing to learn.

Sometimes they just can't cope with the fact that the world can be a terrible fucking place, filled with terrible people who do terrible things to good people for no reason, and that not everyone has a great, mediocre life of being born and growing up in a happy family, where the biggest problem is how they'll get into college/get a job and claw their way up the socioeconomic ladder. They're not used to seeing proof of true suffering, particularly if you live in a first-world country. That's not the fault of the sufferers. And really, it's not the fault of the onlookers either. It's just the way society is now. Call it pessimistic, but that's just how I see it.

Regardless, it's natural for humans to seek comfort and mental support from those around them. We've been social creatures for hundreds of thousands of years, sharing our feelings and emotions with one another. Don't feel like a freak, not for sharing your past suffering, nor for being the sufferer. Trust me, I know what it's like to feel that way. I haven't been through nearly as much as you have, but my disability is still something I end up talking to people about, whether for comfort or just to get a weight off of my chest. I always avoid the less palatable stuff, like the difficulties I have in the bathroom, because I feel like it's just too much for them to handle without them either being overcome with sympathy or looking at me as subhuman. In the end, though, it's usually just my mind making up bad scenarios and feeding into them because of how I see myself, not because of how they see me.

Basically, try not to worry too much about what they think about it all. If they're worth a damn, they won't think any less of you. I know it's hard, in terms of simply worrying about what people think, and it sometimes feels like your brain is trying to torture you with your own thoughts, like you have no control over it. But you have to at least try.

Speaking to your personal situation, though, I can only say that there's at least one person doesn't think of you as a freak or a burden, and that's me. And I'm certain I'm not the only one. I know that some people suffer immense amounts of physical and mental abuse, and it doesn't hurt me that you're talking about it. It's part of being human, and to deny you empathy because I don't know exactly how to respond or because it makes me sad to hear your story would be just plain wrong. So if you need someone to talk to at some point, whether about the day's events or about the things you've gone through, you can always talk to me, even if I'm just some random person on the internet. You won't run the risk of making me depressed or upset about your situation. Trust me, I have a very high threshold for that kind of thing.

Drives me crazy as the SSDI guidelines are vague as they know most on SSDI won't hire a lawyer if they say ""that's income"" but in the case of buying a laptop for $2000 and using it for two years and selling for $1000 shouldn't be considered income.

There was no working AC when I moved in, and their laundry room was sharing a wall with me. They shut off the ventilation and AC in the laundry room cause they were cheap, so the machines constantly running, me having no AC, it was well over 100 degrees in there day and night.

I am not a lawyer, but I have worked with one previously to dealt with a situation very similar to what OP has described.

Destruction of an assistive device of someone who is disabled is aggravated assault as an assistive device is legally considered a part of a disabled person, and is a felony. Unintentional harm to a disabled person is a Class A1 misdemeanor, so if they could plausibly claim they didn't intend to break OPs cane they'd still be in hot water. This is one of those areas where significant jail time is a possibility.

Forget it as being annoying. They are bullies engaging in assault, are putting you in physical danger by not being able to properly navigate your surroundings, along with the emotional trauma, fear, stress, financial difficulties, or future injury obtained while waiting for a replacement, and under the eyes of the law are doing the same as coming up to you and breaking your arm. The law is clear, and they should be punished.

There is precedent stating that school officials can be charged with negligent supervision for failing to act when an incident is reported. Make sure your school is aware of the assault and that you are pursuing legal actions against the individuals, that by failing to provide adequate protection in a learning environment, they are in violation of Title II of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and potentially Title IX under the Civil Rights Act depending on whether said lack of action was discriminatory as opposed to ""we just don't act on any reports of aggravated assault against a student"". That is a higher bar to clear, but the others are pretty easy. From the language you used, depending on your jurisdiction it may also be possible to target them with a Hate Crime statute.

This is a typical ploy of Trump's bc the man is a vengeful idiot. The US Government has been notoriously bad at oversight. This, I believe, is the root cause of many of the country's financial ills. Rather than pick on the poorest of Americans, Congress could do better by the constituency simple by paying attention to how money is being spent.

If the  government changed policies and procedures to watch over the various entities including annual audits of each department, I feel there would be substantial funds to cover existing programs and create new ones. Back in the day when we used check books, we would receive canceled checks each month and have to reconcile our accounts. Auditing government spending is no different and can identify fraud and waste much sooner.

If you gave your teenager $20 for a book needed for class, but they spent it on a CD, would you be inclined to give them more? Why should it be any different with our tax dollars?

Idk if it’s your style, but I’ve seen people put spikes on the handles of their wheelchairs which deters people from grabbing them, and I know that one of the reasons I wore spikes as an autistic teen was to get people to not touch me

For the same reason, I like to wear shoulder pads and leather jackets and when it’s too hot for anything I still wear a crop denim vest, because I just severely don’t like it when people touch me out of nowhere.

I don’t believe the crux of these issues was that “you can’t resist because you are disabled” - since that would be direct disability discrimination. However, the staff (your disability advisor in particular) appear to be doing their jobs POORLY, by misinterpreting and not taking the time to understand and communicate your needs to other staff members. 

In my opinion, rather than ‘disability discrimination’ - these are cases of thoughtlessness/ misinformation/ carelessness. 
They have most definitely done wrong by you, as a member of the university, and if there is something that can be done to rectify the situation now (either a grade boost or a late re-sit) it may be worth pursuing, however, a lot of time has now passed and if the issue cannot be resolved, I would personally let this be an unfortunate thing of the past. 

*I say this from experience. I was rejected for a place on a university trip as unfortunately they package hotel didn’t include “accessible rooms”. Everyone knows I use a wheelchair, so when the places were allocated, the students took time to phone and check for wheelchair access. When they found there was none, sent me a very polite, apologetic explanation via email and offered my place to someone else. I then told them that despite using a wheelchair, I don’t actually need specific “accessible accommodation”. Just level access, which the hotel had, so it was fine for me. Unfortunately they had already given my place to another student and taken their deposit, so I ended up not having a place on this trip. As upsetting as this was, it wasn’t discrimination, they just incorrectly interpreted my needs. This is of course much less serious than your situation, and in this case they were trying to do what was in my best interests. But in both cases our needs were incorrectly interpreted - which in my eyes, is not disability discrimination.* Just one girl’s humble opinion :)",,,1,0,0,

what i worry about is a reviewer will look at a condition and not consider context, subject a person to review, and cut benefits they need. i dont think this is me making a slippery slope argument here. its normal for people to get denied when they try to get ssi or ssdi even if they have a debilitating condition and thorough documentation.

Trying too hard to overcome one’s anger is actually counterproductive to moving through it. You have a right to feel angry. You are valid in your frustrations. Anyone would feel some anger if they were in your situation.

Still, your anger is only a bridge...if you can learn how to cross it. Most of us need a lot of time and some help with this. Sweeping it under the rug and wishing for it to go away just causes it to befuddle and trap us whenever it comes back.

At the end of the road of grief is acceptance, and it is a difficult road with lots and ups and downs. But, if you can think of acceptance as a beacon in the distance, it can help guide you in small ways each day toward a life where you struggle mentally less with whatever physical challenges present themselves. 

Your disability and the emotions it gives rise to can reveal the ways you might simplify your life, by making you aware of things you might be able to change or let go of. It can uncover the ways you may not be treating yourself as kindly and compassionately as you might. It can allow you develop your awareness toward a new level of mental freedom that no physical limitation can constrain.

*If* you can take a step back from your anger when you experience it...if you can notice it and care for it, with kindness and with love...your greatest challenges can become your path to unimaginable wisdom and enlightenment.

You are not alone in your struggles. I am with you. Everyone here who has struggled is with you. Everyone in the world who has struggled is with you. Keep coming to us when you need support, and we will help you find your way through it. Talking to a therapist can also be helpful, because they can follow you personally on your whole journey rather than just pop in the we we are able to.

You can do this! Sending you love and compassion, directly from my heart to yours!!! May you be well.

As usual, business and government and the judiciary focus on protecting their interests, not ours. It has become a real and pitched war; every step toward basic human rights and protected access is one step backwards for organizations and related legal entities who care more about cost than constancy, it seems.

As usual, the binding contract signed in ignorance and under no small amount of systemic coercion is held to its strictest terms, while the broader issue of informed consent (and the various obfuscations thereof that are rampant in today's digital domains) are cosseted, cozened, and kept in close care by those who profit from them.

As usual, a judge upholds current application/interpretation.

States are beginning to get wise, but only because, at long last, the practices they supported so long in the name of pork and personal or professional progress are finally down to choosing between the ""us"" and ""them"" that is ""federal' and ""state"".

""Oh, look"", they say, ""If we let them abuse our constituency, they up and move away!""

As the final, slender thread of economy unravels, at last, they begin to see. And stories like this, to anger and incite the constituency to fight for themselves arrive.

Because, even now, when it matters most for us all, the culture and habit of self-absorbed profiteering in the name of celebrity, status, and power have priority over all.

41cc0508-a611-4c74-a895-032a41f16ade,1577735268,"I am sorry to hear about your issue.  I, too, have been dealing with the balancing issue for some years now.  In addition to losing balance here and there, I still walk side ways when I try to walk forward in darkness (such as a movie theater).  Based on my experience to this point because I know that I am doing much better than when the problem kicked in, let me share some thoughts.

First, think safety.  You need to stay safe by preventing your body from falling.  You are already using a cane and that is a good start.  When walking up/down the stairs, use the handrail, especially when walking down because your brain needs more info/energy to crunch the data for coordination than walking up.  When walking down, try to look straight, and even up while utilizing handrail to walk down the stairs slowly.  In my case, it felt like the whole world was shaking each time I took a step down and losing balance.  There were times that I felt like I would just roll down the stairs from falling, so I still try to be cautious by having hand over the railing.  Ensure that your environment is safe, in case you fall: know where things are so that you can prevent yourself from falling by leveraging wall/furniture.  Or avoid those obstacles to minimize any injuries from falling.

Second, you need to stay active through exercises/rehabs that will decrease the frequency of the imbalance issue.  ""Neuroplasticity"" is the big idea that's floating out there that our brains have ways to rewiring themselves to compensate for lost functionalities.  And to take that happen, you reprogram your brain through repetitive movements.  No one can tell you how long it could take or you will be back at 100% again, and thus it can be frustrating time to time to repeat what seem to be ""stupid"" exercises.  You, however, will notice improvements down the road.  For this, I suggest you logging what you are doing for how much on daily basis, and how you are challenging yourself.  You will likely see minimal differences over some days, but you will see noticeable differences in months.  I use a stationary exercise bike for daily exercise because I know I can get a good workout without risking a fall.  I sometimes use elliptical, but I am very cautious on how I get on/off of it.  With stronger legs, I nowadays try to walk without cane for about 15 minutes a day on trail (where I know it's relatively safe), with the intention to increase the duration down the road.

Third, you need to observe if something worsens the balancing issue.  As for me, fatigue usually amplifies the issue (but I still experience the imbalance issue even when I feel fully rested).  If you do have other factors that worsens your problem, talk to your neurologist to see if he/she can suggest the control those other factors.  A few issues with taking any medications are that there are side effects and you don't know the benefit for multiple weeks.  And you have to go through the trial-and-error stage to figure out what really benefits you and whether those benefits outweigh the side effects you deal with.  

During my confusing journey to figure out what was wrong with me, I asked one of the neurologists I have seen in the past - whether I can jog/run to exercise again.  Her response was ""no"", and I am hoping to prove her wrong.",,,1,0,0,

For my the change was gradual, Parkinson's, but can relate.

In the AMA you have one comment I tell everyone:

&gt;We learned that it is incredibly important for the survivor or a family  member/friend to be your biggest advocate. You can have the best doctors  in the world, but it still helps to have somebody asking lots of  questions. Nobody will care more about your care than you or your loved  ones.

&amp;#x200B;

We must be our own advocates! I take my medications with me to the hospital, full list of medications, why I take them, how often I take them, who prescribed. Paper has ""MY name is ParkieDude.  I have Parkinson's, I need my medication on time, every time, wake me!"".

With Parkinson's my medication works great. When it is effective I am ""on"". Movement good, speech clear. When my medication wears off, movement is very rigid/difficult, face goes blank, speech slurs.   So thirty minutes prior to my lobectomy I'm in a good mood, happy, chatting with the pre-op nurse. She leaves and comes back 30 minutes later and thinks I've has a stroke! Nope meds wore off. Had I not advocated for myself they would have scrubbed surgery and sent me to the ER! Last thing I needed.

I took medication every three hours, which gave me about 90 minutes of on time.   I've had DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) since then.

EDIT: Advocate for yourself. It is import to bring a friend to your appointments and have written out questions beforehand ""why am I here today; what do I hope to resolve; what is my follow up"".   Going through the roller coaster of cancer it was so critical to have those notes. After an appointment; sit down in a coffee shop and go through everything you remember. Having a friend helps as you have missed something, but comparing notes and writing everything down helps.   My words have gone, I use Grammarly to help with my spelling/grammar.",,,2,0,0,

I worked with a chronic pain psychologist for a few years and she really helped me.  She worked with me to help me ""get out of my head"" as the pain drew me in an made me hyper aware of every little thing in my body.

It took awhile, and of course my pain never went away as my condition is progressing (Arachnoiditis plus several other things), but it's really helped me to get more control and improve my outlook.

The two main things we focused on are building a schedule and mindfulness thinking (puzzles, folding clothes and organizing small things work for me). 

Building a schedule really helps me because it allows me to focus on the next thing I need to be doing each day and keeps me and a forward-thinking mindset. The mindfulness thinking helps me get out of my head as you're supposed to focus on the task before you. If I'm not up to doing tasks, I use apps and try meditation for mindfulness exercises.

(ooh and it's on sale right now!)  This is a little pixel art game about living on a farm and contributing to your town.  It's won numerous awards, has a HUGE fan-base, and amazingly was made by just 1 developer.  It's also one of those games that is great for non-gamers to get hooked into the gaming world.  (I spent 60 hours in it the very first week I got it!)  And it's not very demanding on your computer.  Plus it's just wholesome as hell.  You can play alone, or with friends on a group farm.

If you're looking for even MORE creative freedom, I'd say try [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/).  The graphics in this one are VERY blocky and simple, but there's a reason for it.  EVERY SINGLE SQUARE in this world is movable.  You can COMPLETELY build your ENTIRE world here.  Castles, caves, skyscrapers, cities, statues, even working machines!  There are two game modes, one with some conflict where creatures will attack you at night, so you have to build defenses and tools, and then creative mode that is absolute freedom to just build and make art.  Some of the things people have made in that game are MIND BLOWING.  And most of the worlds people make are shared, so if you so desire you can download their servers and play in them too.  (This also has play with friends!)

Then there's the point'n'clicks.  These are gonna be more about story, and not player creativity.  They're also mostly solo games.  But they are lovely none the less!  Happy and weird are signature in this genre.  A good one to get you started with a feel for the genre is [Dropsy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/274350/Dropsy/). (also on sale!)  This is about a clown that likes to give hugs.  It's SUPER simple, but SO heartwarming that it's easy to fall in love with.  The art is very bright and fun.  It has a really cute story and is very simple to play.  You don't even have to read anything, as all the interaction are picture based.  Another P'n'C I love is [The Dream Machine.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/94300/The_Dream_Machine_Chapter_1__2/)  (woo another sale!)  This one is made with claymation, and developed by just 2 guys.  It took them 8 years to make and it is GORGEOUS.  The story in this one is a bit more dark and sad, but it is a MASTERPIECE of the genre, and will definitely fill the ""weird"" label.  All the dialogue tho is written, so be prepared for lots of reading.

I can go on like this for a while, but I feel like I've written a book at you... lol!  Just a few more mentions that were really awesome to me:  [TellTale's The Walking Dead](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/collection/the-walking-dead-collection) is one of those comic-book like choose your own adventures.  It's one of their best.  Will hit you right in the feels.  (has some zombie violence tho.)  If you'd like more comedy, [Tales from the Borderlands](https://borderlands.com/en-US/shop/tales-from-the-borderlands/#rg=""united-states"") is laugh-out-loud funny and you don't need any prior knowledge of the Borderlands franchise to appreciate it.  That is also a choose-your-adventure type.  There are some simulation games that simulate social media with a sort-of spying twist to them that are very fun to me, [Orwell](https://store.steampowered.com/app/491950/Orwell_Keeping_an_Eye_On_You/) or [Do Not Feed the Monkeys](https://store.steampowered.com/app/658850/Do_Not_Feed_the_Monkeys/) or [Papers Please](https://store.steampowered.com/app/239030/Papers_Please/).  (all 3 on sale!)

If you have any questions plz feel free to hit me up!  Would be happy to throw more recommendations at you or help ya get those started if you need!  Also check out the [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/) launcher.  They've been giving out games for free like crazy trying to promote themselves, so you can get in on some freebies every month there.  And for the next 10 days they're giving away a game a day for the holidays!  Srsly, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!

We now get to focus on looking towards the future. We want to buy a house, have kids, etc etc. We finally found a trucking company that does things legally, let's my husband sleep, and doesn't make him drive 20+ hours a day. We both got so sick when we were with a company that did that, and it's how we ended up in that house. The stress from both of us trying to stay up all the time was unreal. He would try to get me to sleep, but I hated him driving all day, alone, being so tired.  We were trying to rent a place for a few weeks to sleep and get antibiotics (we both went through pneumonia).

Anyway, it's nice to talk to other people about all this who are sympathetic. It's been rough, and the only person I have gotten to vent to is my husband. We tried finding resources or any help, but as a trans, interracial couple who were not victims of the key domestic assault word that most services are for, we were left to deal with it ourselves. 

I talk about it openly if people believe me, but we've run into so many people in our circle who just brushed off the fact that we almost died multiple times over and couldn't get services because of being trans masculine, disabled, and my husband being black.

Obviously, many disabled people feel like they can empathize with other disabled people based on shared struggles--even if two people have radically different disabilities and can only understand in a very broad sense.

Put simply, absent other influences and information, I certainly don't think it's wrong to ""wonder"" about this. 

It may be my turn to say I might be coming across wrongly as I will offer some conflicting opinions as well. 

All that said.... you are not deaf. It would be natural for a deaf person to want to date another deaf person as many such people feel like they are part of their own Deaf culture with a capital ""D"" and would want to find someone like that. In other words, they would seek out a potential deaf partner because of their shared disability. 

The situation might be a bit more complex for you, as wondering about dating a deaf person might also lead you to choosing a deaf person because they are disabled in a particular way that ""benefits"" you.

I've recently started to have to use a chair and honestly I'm trying to make my chair as fun as I can to make it a positive in my life. I see a psycotherapist for the tough stuff and try to do things within the community, we have a choir here for folks with life long conditions, and all ability cycling(I use a tricycle with two seats side by side).
I really struggled when I started using my rollator if I'm honest i struggled more with that than with my wheelchair.

I think everyone takes their own time to adjust to the need for adaptions/walking aids. Or any other issues.

I've been housebound for about a year and a half now, and this is what has helped me to maintain some friendships:

• Online friendships with people in hobby groups on Facebook or old school forums. I dislike making friends with people in support groups for my conditions because a lot of them are trying to win the gold medal in the Suffering Olympics. But random grandmas that only use Facebook to talk to other people who crochet? Sign me up! My retired online friends are awesome.

• I started a local crochet/craft hobby group, but we meet at my house. That way I don't have to go anywhere. We stay in touch in a Facebook group between meetings.

• There are social groups/volunteering clubs/religious groups, and at least where I live, they're often so desperate for members that they'll give you rides if you ask. I've gone to some events with my friend's Lions Club where we did things like collect used books for kids. I literally sat in a camp chair for an hour and told people ""put your books in that box, be gentle please! Thanks!"" Then we went to a bar for beer &amp; snacks. It can be fun and even though it's ""volunteering,"" they usually have jobs that can be adapted to meet even pretty restrictive accomodations. 

• I got signed up and approved for my state's paratransit program (they require extensive medical documentation and an interview, the process of getting approved is a major pain in the ass). I'm not sure where you're located, but I can pay $12 roundtrip from my house to anywhere in the state. I can take my wheelchair or I can sit in the regular seats if I'm using my forearm crutches that day. $12 is a lot, so I try to limit it to once a month or less, but it's an option. Maybe they have one where you live (and it might even be cheaper). You could use it to go to trivia night at the bar, or a hobby group at the local library or something. 

• There's an organization called Easter Seals where I live, that hosts social groups for disabled people. They also do a bunch of other, more medical type services, like adult day care and occupational therapy. But their social groups are usually fun, very accessible, and provide transportation depending on who is sponsoring the program. I went more often when I was recovering from my craniotomy because back then I wasn't quite cognitively ready for a very stimulating environment and still needed some skilled supervision.

• When I'm home alone, I flip through news channels and shopping channels. For some reason it makes me feel less lonely to see someone talking live on TV because it's kind of like they're talking to me. Sounds stupid but is surprisingly helpful.

Good luck to you! It's hard to make good friends, so I focus on maintaining friendly acquaintanceships, which is still super helpful for my mental health.",,,2,0,0,

I can understand that if you cant work consistently then having the disability is a great resource to pay the bills when you have no income. But if you can make more than what disability gives you in less than 20 hours then how is disability benefiting you? If you want to have a higher income then why not get off disability and lose the income cap? Also why have private insurance? Medicare comes with disability. 

Also your point that ""I'm only allowed to work 20 hours per week while others are allowed to work (a lot) more"" 

The point of disability is that you are not able to work and make enough money to live. ""Specifically, if you can engage in what the Social Security Administration (SSA) calls ""substantial gainful activity"" (SGA), you won't be eligible for SSDI benefits. A person who earns more than a certain monthly amount is considered to be engaging in SGA.""

I also just learned ""The rules differ for business owners, since their monthly income may not reflect the work effort they put into their business. (For more information, see our article on SGA for small business owners.)""

Also,
If your countable income is more than $1,220 a month (in 2019), your self-employment will be considered SGA and you will no longer be eligible for benefits, unless you can show you are not providing significant services to your business. If you are not providing significant services, you can make over the SGA amount.

Also,
During the first nine months that you return to work, you will continue to receive your SSDI benefits, even if you work more than the amount that Social Security considers ""substantial gainful activity,"" or ""SGA."" (SGA generally means that you are earning $1,220 or more per month, in 2019.) At the end of nine months of work, your trial work period is over and your benefits will stop if you are doing SGA.

I recommend reading   [this](https://www.disabilitysecrets.com/resources/social-security-disability/ssdi/income-limits-ssdi-benefits) and [this](https://www.disabilitysecrets.com/dnewsblog/2010/01/social-security-disability-trial-work.html) it is where I got the information above.",,,7,0,0,

There is no need for forced sterilization because the costs and impacts of having a child let alone raising one is effectively the same as starving and destitution. Needing to call the police while impaired means an inability to follow instruction and a high probability of being shot or arrested even when you are the one needing assistance.

Societally, we don’t care about the disabled. New policies are being pushed to require reapplication, validation and monitoring of those who are disabled to ensure they remain disabled enough, and where said reviews result in a cease of benefits and then providing back pay when confirmed - and yet requiring that one can’t keep assets to cover said state manufactured emergencies. Our political leaders mock and express open disgust towards the disabled. They receive public support from white supremacists.

I do actually hate it. I'm not stupid, I taught myself to read. Just because I forgot to grab the dustpan before I started sweeping doesn't mean I'm stupid. Just because I make mistakes or don't reach the same conclusions doesn't make me an idiot. Just because it takes me longer to realize something doesn't make me retarded; my processing is delayed because I'm processing more information at once. You're downloading a megabyte and I'm downloading a gig, my broadband speed is faster than yours so the difference is only a few seconds and somehow that makes *me* the retard?

Similarly I hate the phrase stupid because it implies stunned into a stupor. The concept of someone that is nonverbal or incapable of speaking having no thoughts to speak of was the norm, but we now understand that nonverbal doesn't mean non-thinking. I am often struck in situations where I can't speak or articulate because there are so many concepts that I struggle to condense into words, it's as if English isn't my first language and it's not sufficient for the concepts I want to express or isn't fast enough to explain the abstract notions articulately. You wouldn't call someone unintelligent for struggling to translate something into another language.

In the US, some places are partly funded by HUD, which means that at least some of the apartments are *subsidized*, meaning that there is an income limit to rent and then your rent payment is based on your income.

Only my experience, but I have met many seniors who are resistant to the idea of ""assisted living"" because to them it's the same thing as a dirty nursing home where you have no privacy and fed institutional food.
