You seem to view this issue in an overly simplistic way. If all and every current disability was eradicated today, tomorrow something else would arise as a disability (slightly lower IQ, less symmetrical features). Would it be okay to eradicate those as well? Where is the line?

Walking up stairs and running are pretty normal things that are hard for or impossible for you. Disability *is* certainly a spectrum, and even comparing people with the same disabilities, there are degrees. Your issues seem to prevent you from doing a lot of everyday tasks normally and easily, so I'd say you ""qualify,"" not that I or anyone else gets to tell you that.

The term ableism is used more often to talk about how non disabled people interact with disabled people in ways that are not necessarily discriminatory. 

Example: being told it’s ableist to kneel down to talk to someone in a wheelchair. Maybe one person in a wheelchair would find that rude while another person would appreciate it because it’s painful for them to keep looking upward during an entire conversation due to the arthritis in their neck. 

As a disabled person I find it a lot more offensive to constantly hear “we shouldn’t treat disabled people differently”. We are all individuals and everyone treats everyone else slightly differently.

I can relate to having a not easy time putting my feelings into words. Even when I genuinely try to, I have such a hard time verbalizing what i feel inside. 

(ETA: It took me over 40 mins to write this, for example.)

An exercise that I have found to be helpful may be useful for you and/or both of you because it has a couple of approaches. But I totally understand that its not for everyone, if you dont think it is for you. You may have already been suggested this too. 

1st approach:
Write/type (which ever is more comfortable) a letter describing your concerns, issues, and if you feel up to it, why you think/what are the reasons behind your side of things. You can write the letter as if you are writing it to her or a trusted friend or even to yourself. Dont worry about typos, or run on sentences, just go until you feel youre done. Read it back to yourself, and maybe that can help you to verbalize your concerns to her. You dont ever have to send this letter or share it with anyone if you dont want to. But if you do, and want some feedback, you could always post on here.

2nd Approach:
Write out a letter actually to her about your concerns, and feel free to write as many practice letters as needed. Ask her to read it and discuss afterwards in person. This could be helpful because it gives you the time to consider what it is you want to say, as well as being able to give her the letter and let her have time to contemplate what you are trying to get across with no misunderstandings since it is written down. You could discuss it verbally when she's read it, or she may also like to take time write you one back.

3rd Approach:
Another way could be that you both write down a list each of what concerns you have/what expectations you have the physical side and exchange them. Talking about feelings is not easy, so you could do this together in person and discuss or exchange and give each other space to absorb and respond. See where your wants and needs match and don't, then work together to compromise (if necessary).

I genuinely think its admireable for you to reach out and ask for advice. You clearly care about your person very much. I hope that my suggestion helps, but if it doesn't, that you find another way. 

Thank you so very much for your service, and I wish you both the absolute best!",,,1,0,0,

What my doctor did was tell me that a nurse was going to come in in 20 minutes to check my sats.. That I should be careful because exercise could artificially lower that number. So while I waited I walked around the office swinging my arms, and by the time the nurse came in I was at 86%. Was it fraud? No because truthfully just walking around my house my sats would drop significantly. So honestly measuring it while I’m sitting at rest for a half an hour is an artificial number.

That being said I later stopped utilizing the DME provider for my oxygen because they were such a pain and I bought my own equipment. There’s no help for that because they pay for you to rent it but I bought a home oxygen concentrator off of craigslist for $500. That was probably five years ago now and it still works fine.

A 10 is when you can’t move and/or pass out from the pain. It’s an emergency and you must be taken to the ER immediately. It’s crushed limb, meningitis, being set on fire, etc. Level 10 pain can put you in neurogenic shock. If you were working and going to school, there is no way that your pain is a 10.

At a pain level of 9, you generally can’t talk. At 9 or 10, doctor’s will induce a coma for pain management. I speak from experience. 

A pain level of 6 is when you think about your pain all the time. An 8 is when you can’t think of anything but the pain. See the difference?

If you walk into a doctor’s office and claim that your pain is a 10, they won’t believe you. Simply because you walked in and are speaking. If you claim to be a college student, they won’t believe you are an 8. 

If you exaggerate your pain to doctors or the SSA, they will assume that you are being less than honest. You won’t get the best care for your pain. because the doctors don’t know you actual pain levels. Or they may think you are drug seeking.",,,4,0,0,

On SSDI there is no asset limit nor is there a limit to the income your spouse can earn, nor is there a limit to the amount of unearned income you can have. The only limit is how much you can actually earn yourself. It is SSDI that offers a dependent benefit, so your three-year-old would be typically entitled to about 50% of your benefit amount, although it doesn’t affect how much you actually get. So, hypothetically if your benefit was $1000 you would get that thousand dollars every month plus your child would get $500 every month.

d42770b1-9f84-462c-9536-090461a2ff56,1570083664,"It sounds like you are showing signs of depression. Have your therapist go over cognitive distortions with you. Things like all or nothing (black and white) thinking - basically any time you have a negative thought that includes the words always, never, etc. Like ""I will never get a job again."" ""Should"" statements are similar. My therapist would always catch me using that word and have me challenge that thought. These thoughts you're having are part of a consistent pattern that everyone with depression goes through - you are not alone.

Another thought which really helped me is that even though depression gets in the way of you showing compassion to yourself, it doesn't limit our ability to show compassion to others as much. So what you can do is in each individual situation, ask yourself what you would say to your brother if he was in it. You'll find a kinder, far different, response that way, and it's generally now indicative of reality than your depression is allowing you to think yourself.

Once you've confirmed you have depression, you may also want to seek out medication. I'm speaking as a person with depression and anxiety here, and I'm gonna flat out say I would not be able to do what, albeit limited, work I do if I didn't have medication combined with my counseling. I do not have physical disabilities, mind, ""just"" severe depression/anxiety (when untreated), migraines, and fibromyalgia. But without treatment of my depression and anxiety I never would have seen how even though I might not be able to work in the schools and clinics I had before (migraines and fluorescent lights do not mix), I could still get in a limited number of hours of work if I went to the homes, even if it was only six hours a week or so. This exact solution probably wouldn't work for you, but my point is, when your brain is making you view the world in this skewed way, you can't imagine (or immediately dismiss it if you can) ways in which you can still be successful. 

Good luck! Your feelings are absolutely valid and you are doing all the right things. Keep going down this path and you will eventually see success. Sending you the love your brain won't allow you to give yourself, which you do indeed deserve.",,,1,0,0,

I would say it’s undoubtedly overall more difficult to navigate the world if you’re a full-time wheelchair user. I think we can recognise that people like us with limited mobility have our own unique challenges - I could self-propel linger distances in a wheelchair than I can on crutches, for example. And we shouldn’t be made to feel less part of the disabled community than our wheelchair-using friends. 

But I think it’s also important to keep in mind when it comes to resources for disabled people, it’s not equal. Disabled parking is a great example - I need parking near my destination, but I don’t need an extra-wide space for navigating a wheelchair in and out Of the car. Some disabled people need more resources and accommodations than others. I think we can all acknowledge those differences based on need while being inclusive to all disabilities.",,,3,0,0,

There is no psychiatric or psychological or neurological intervention that can cure or effectively treat BIID. The only effective treatment that has been found so far is getting the body you need, usually through amputation. If you need paralysis like I do, the options are even more limited. 

I and most of the people with BIID I know do consider how we live with our BIID impacts our families, friends, other disabled people, and trans people. The term “transabled” has been taken up by many anti-trans rights activists and has also been criticized by trans people as appropriating their experience. Because of this it is not used widely currently by people with BIID, and especially not now compared with when the source materials that the article referenced was based upon were created. (Although the referenced article is relatively new it is based on internet articles and videos from 4 or 5 years ago and incorrectly summarizes some of that information.)

Interestingly many people with BIID are already disabled, some of them physically. I am not physically disabled, but I do have autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and ADHD (as well as depression, but that has improved significantly since I stopped suppressing my BIID.)

She gave me the shot and I immediately felt syncope coming on (a typical reaction to the injection) the nurse watched me get pale and they got me water and a wheelchair to go to the other building. When I got back the phlebotomists were talking about the coincidence that this test they never did before has been ordered twice in a row and the other person had just left for her injection. I get the blood drawn at 30 mins then back in the lobby to wait and the other girl comes in. She is supposed to have a paper with the time she got the injection, a paper that was so heavily discussed between the nurses that gave me the injection, the paper that is pivotal in this exchange and the girl doesn't have it. The nurses can't contact the doctor and they have no idea what time this is supposed to happen. We basically crowdsourced the time she got her injection between my dad passing her when he dropped of the wheelchair and her getting back to the lab.

That is a symptom of a mental illness - not doing something important to your continued comfort and survival.

You kept putting off something you NEEDED to do. That is unhealthy, and IS PROBABLY part of your anxiety or bipolar - an aversion to do things you need to do. Healthy minded people do not put off things they NEED to do.

You are healthy enough to go and do it anyway eventually, which is good - its hopefully not getting in the way of your daily life if that is the case.
But someone who does NOT end up doing it and fails that section of their course when they weren't aiming to fail - that isn't laziness. That is self harming behaviour that is getting in the way of their life.
Someone who is aiming to fail their course but has no plans to do anything else but lay around in bed all day is ALSO not laziness - that is self harming behaviour that is getting int he way of their life.

Disinterest, in its most healthy and basic form, is not laziness - because it ONLY AFFECTS NON-IMPORTANT THINGS. There's no point in getting mad at a kid for not being interested in sports if they don't want to play them.

Disinterest, in its most extreme and unhealthy form, is not laziness - because it STOPS YOU FROM LIVING COMFORTABLY.

fb329841-4772-486c-a6a4-6c0284d71b52,1570498810,"I have a series of chronic illnesses and am on disability because of it. Though I have good days here and there, I spend most days exhausted physically and mentally.

The DAY I was diagnosed with the first of my conditions, the guy I'd be dating for a year dumped me. We didn't know anything about the treatment options, prognosis, nothing...and he left me because it ""didn't sound fun."" I decided to consider it a dodged bullet. Better to learn early that he'd jump ship at the first sign of trouble than learn five years in, right? It wouldn't be the only time I'd be dumped for being sick.

Fortunately, I learned to use my disability as a jackass filter. I started telling guys on or about the third date, or earlier if it could be tied into a conversation organically. If a guy balked, criticized, or peppered me with overly personal questions, he was deemed at best ""not getting it"" and at worst, a jerk. Again, it was better to rule out a guy early than waste my (or his) time.

I am now three months out from my wedding to an incredible man who not only accepts my health issues, but is sensitive to them. He's supportive when I'm having a bad day. He trusts me to give as much as I can without asking me for more than I can give. He sees all I have to offer. And he values the things that I can do, rather than lamenting what I can't. We're facing a new diagnosis now, and he's already reminded me that he's here to stay.

Great guys are out there.

PS: I think what made a difference in how people responded to my health disclosure was how I presented it. I used to be hesitant in my presentation of the information, as if I was embarrassed or scared of sharing it. People got scared and uncomfortable, as if I was delivering sad/bad news. Once I started just stating the facts in a normal tone (""I have a series of non-contagious, non-fatal, non-degenerative neurological problems that negatively impact my ability to work. That said, I am financially and otherwise completely independent and am not looking for anyone to take care of me.) people responded much more comfortably.

Why shopping at the store is hard for me:   
I have problems making decisions, I am always playing the numbers game with store sales, coupons, rebates, etc., I wind up buying items I don't need, I have trouble touching things and having a ""bad thought"" and putting it back, etc. . . it was literally while I was describing shopping that the judge cut me off and granted me SSDI.  Shopping at home is less stressful.   


What I like about Shipt:   
It is owned by Target, so if you shop through the Target website, you're going to pay Target prices and you can use their discount program as well.   


The yearly subscription price (I believe about $100) is doable for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Your shopper will text you in real time if something is out of stock to see if you want a substitution. 

&amp;#x200B;

Delivery right to your door; many people without a lot of money don't live near affordable supermarkets and many people with disabilities can't travel very far. 

Same day delivery, often within a few hours. This came in VERY handy when I had a flu-like virus. I had tissues, broth, etc. delivered. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can get almost anything other than clothing and prescriptions. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I Don't Like:   
Too many items out of stock that claim to be in stock on the web site. 

Can't reserve a time before you start shopping, and the times go quickly. 

Can't always trust shoppers to bring correct items. 

If you shop directly through Shipt website (for non-Target stores), prices are insane. I just paid almost $6 for ground turkey that I could get for $3.50 elsewhere. (I have a Shipt credit from a screw up on their end, so I didn't mind spending it.) They also don't honor weekly sale prices.   


Can't use coupons or rebate apps like ibotta, but it's worth it to me to not have to go to the store.

Usually you can tell by the response you get whether even the police are too overworked but it really depends on the responding officer, so the best approach is to find a way to go to the station and report in person with the desk duty officer, who's there for just that and doesn't need to travel for response.  In terms of civil redress anything you do will also involve having both Purolator and Amazon on the hook because they tend to pay go-away money so your civil lawyer would automatically include them; and there are law reasons to do that as well.  Your decision in terms of that is whether you want to risk having it on record with Purolator and Amazon that you were trouble.  It could help you or hurt you or make no difference.  Then there's the wild card of either local or unpredictably-elsewhere media getting wind of such things and seeing your disability as particularly, please forgive me, visible and helpful to a story.

It may not seem related that there's a whole genus of mollusc on which there are no living experts today but the same thing exists in medical research.  The research has to be funded and the only funders that are consistently available are either companies that develop solutions and then market them, or specific-illness fundraising nonprofits that then fund research.  It's a flawed system but the research has become incredibly expensive for legitimate reasons and enough money for it is hard to find without the above two things.  

In addition to that it sounds like you're a so-called ""statistical outlier.""  A lot of research is statistical and needs many data points.  If most data points are fairly consistently around each other and a very few are way off by themselves, there are two choices: account for those outliers in a way that can make the account incredibly difficult to arrive at and usually leads to little having been accomplished except to need more study; or discard the outliers so you have a result that's more definite and has accomplished more for the majority you did not discard.  Your situation really sucks and it's not your fault, but the reason people aren't helping you is that it would cost them a shitpile of money to figure out how to help you and the way things are done today they'd need more patients than just you to figure out anything.

Sorry if that sounds even more depressing but I feel for you because we share some of these two problems although my problems are not nearly as visible and not limiting in the same ways as yours.  My physical problems are straightforward even if they're my major life expectancy reducers, kidneys and liver, but my mental shit is slippery and no one has ever figured it out, only done the little they could which was nothing.

They knew the ins and out and asked the right questions and countered and added what needed to be added.  They made sure all my documents was listed (some were not and he had them search for them before we continued).

When it came time to ask the hearings job coordinator if there was any jobs I could handle and they began listing jobs the Lawyer rebuttal each and every one and referred to my files on why not.

Oddly, I found that when it became official, it was actually easier. I had the validation of outside experts who didn't even know me looking at my history and records and deciding I was impaired enough to qualify as disabled. It sort of gave me permission to lighten up on myself, to forgive myself for my lack of perfection.

I still have moments of discomfort with the word ""disabled"", mostly with new people, and mostly because I just don't want to have to explain my whole deal and saying I'm disabled always triggers about a million questions. I work part-time (it's really beneficial for my particular conditions to have a routine and get out of the house), so with people I'm meeting I usually just say I work at such-and-such place.

I've worked a TON in therapy to change my thought patterns toward myself. I've gotten a lot kinder to myself and when I'm struggling I really try to stop beating myself up and give myself permission to stay home, or not do X, or whatever. It's a work in progress but I can't believe how far I've come.

To get started, practice thinking the word ""disabled"" in relation to yourself, and practice saying it out loud to yourself and people you're close to. It's like any major life change, it takes some getting used to. Give yourself permission to feel uncomfortable about it, to feel weird or awkward or whatever else you feel - you'll work through it with time. You're doing your best, and that's good enough. That's a big shift in mindset, but it's a very healthy one.

00f29e61-c452-41bf-b67b-bb63985c21b4,1571833150,"Hi,

I'm a manual chair user in the UK, so here's my advice:

1) Get some gloves. I live in a city where everything is on a hill and all the pavements are sloped. So I wear gloves when using my chair. My gloves are half fingered with a full thumb and this stops my skin being ripped off but still allows me to use touch screens. You'll probably have to try many pairs of gloves until you find ones that suit you.

2) Get better grips. It may be too late but I'd advise using something like Surge LT grips on your wheels. They add to the cost but the extra grip can be invaluable.

3) Find somewhere to practice. You're going to be using your muscles in a different way, and that's going to take time to get them up to scratch. So try and find somewhere you can practice. You're looking for somewhere flat, smooth and horizontal. Shopping centres are the best places I've found, whether they are enclosed like Meadowhall or Bluewater or are just a typical collection of B&amp;Q/Tesco/Matalan outdoor stores. Then you can practice rolling around on a flat surface. Don't overdo it, start slow and steadily build up the distance and speed. Try and get out every day to practice.  Think of two kinds of exercise - short and fast sprints and then longer and slower 'jogs' to build up stamina. It takes a few months, but you'll suddenly find that you can manage slopes, hills, and all-day excursions.

Good luck, and PM me is you want/need to chat.",,,2,0,0,

The other major thing for me is that they won't come in my house and put the bags on the kitchen counter. I get that that's a safety issue but it's a real pain that they only will lean in my front door and drop things on the floor.

I purchased a rolly cart that I moved to the front door and sometimes they even argue about leaning in and putting bags on the cart for me so I can roll the bags to my kitchen and 
put my items away.

I also try to reduce my plastic waste so the fact that they are now the ""CVS of plastic bags"" with their home delivery is beyond annoying.

From the shopping standpoint, being able to identify and select my own produce and meats would be helpful and making sure that they don't have badly dented cans or expired products is a big plus.

Good luck!

This view gave me a much more positive view of disability, in the sense that it shows if i can motivate social change o

The market of disabled people who would benefit from smart technology, own their home, and can afford to upgrade to smart home hardware is small. As a point of reference: I collect the maximum possible SSDI monthly benefit.  I spent the equivalent of 18 months worth of benefits on smart home technology hardware, and could easily spend another 9 months worth of benefits on further upgrades.

Personally, I didn’t realize I had a disability when I was younger. People told me I was just lazy and I believed them.
And I didn’t have any disabled family, and no disabled friends until my last year of high school (I was mostly homeschool until then), so accessibility never occurred to me. Until I became more ill and was finally diagnosed in my 20’s.
Even then, the only things that really crossed my mind were how lack of specific accessibility affected -me-.
It wasn’t until I became a part of the disabled community online that my perspective really broadened.
Now I see inaccessibility everywhere, beyond just how it affects my personal meatsuit, and it’s infuriating.

I think people sort of choose how deeply to involve themselves in it, whether they’re aware of that or not.
My family, partner, and close friends had no experience with it. Now, because of me, they’re generally pretty good at at least determining how specific lack of accessibility will directly affect me. But it doesn’t cross their mind to consider how different things affect people who have different limitations and needs than me.

1. You must have a medical impairment that is documented as diagnosed by a doctor.
2. This impairment must prevent you from performing ANY  ""Substantial Gainful Activity"", which for 2019 is the ability to earn $1,220.00 per month.  
3. It doesn't matter if the jobs you may be able to perform don't exist in your area.  The SSA has denied applicants stating that they could earn a living as a battery tester.  Yes, I am serious.
4. For disability from a mental illness, the SSA wants to see about 2 years of documented, regular mental health treatment.
5. SSA does not accept any excuses for not obtaining mental health treatment.  Saying that your mental illness prevents you from leaving the house to go see a doctor, doesn't cut it.  The solid understanding by the SSA is that if you are sick enough to be disabled, you are sick enough to require regular doctor's care.

Walmart will appeal to higher court.

Often for plaintiff and legal staff they will bargain a lower amount rather than waiting months for the case to come up in a higher case.

Symptom management for autism may be attainable in the future given the rate medicine is advancing. The person you mentioned would probably benefit from symptom management if the technology existed. A group home may be the closest thing we have to symptom management for him, at this point. But to “cure” them likely means changing something at the genetic level before they were even born. At this point, we don’t have enough information to know which genes will cause minor autism and which will cause a more severe case. We don’t know how much environmental factors affecting genes causes this, either. Eradicating or altering those genes could mean getting rid of the autistic phenotype all together, which I think is a dangerous road to start to go down.

To take the Comic-Con example, I do think it would be nicer if the focus was on your character. I am assuming most ableds are afforded this basic courtesy and they don't have to explain about themselves before they get to their character.

Speaking only for myself, I very much encourage questions. They are one of the main ways people can learn about us. Before I go further, let me just say I understand getting tired of answering the same kinds of questions and not wanting to. Some days are like that. Some weeks are like that.

I had an early morning class at uni. There was a young woman who must've had class at the opposite end of campus around the same time, because we passed by each other most mornings. If I ever looked over at her, she always, without fail, looked away quickly or at the ground and did not engage with me whatsoever. I felt I was pretty harmless looking no a scooter and with a cane betwixt my legs, so I didn't think it was that she was intimidated by me. I thought maybe I knew her from a party and maybe accidentally offended her. But I didn't recognize her.

Anyways, after a few weeks of this, she dropped some stuff on the way. It was cold, so I went over to help her get it quickly. I said ""hey, I guess we run into each other a lot, and you seem super uncomfortable. I hope I didn't accidentally offend you somehow; I didn't mean to if I did.""

She said no, it's just that she thought I would think she was super rude if I saw she was looking at me, and she was very nervous about it.

If we'd been able to chat sooner, I wouldn't have assumed that either I offended her or she just really didn't like disableds, etc. And asking questions and not being afraid of the social ""don't stare, don't ask"" stuff would have helped with that.

That's not to say kids and adults can't be rude, or that staring isn't rude in general--it is. But people get so tied up about it, that sometimes they won't even look at you, and it turns out that isn't out of malice, but out of being a bit hypersensitive to not being able to look at someone or ask a question.

We should still teach kids (and adults who don't seem to get it) that blatant staring or pointing is wrong, and that there are right ways to ask questions, too. But just my two cents, asking questions is a very good thing--there are worse alternatives.

I realize your post focuses on adults and that you do answer kids, but I used the example of an adult I met to illustrate it. No, we didn't fall madly in love after that, but I hope I made her a bit more comfortable around disabled people and a bit more open to chatting with people who are different.

I do know how exhausting the questions can be, though, and I want you to know that.

Apart from difficulties from not being native to the culture, which my parents also had, your sister is falling through the cracks.  Health care is highly fragmented and it's hard to pull together a coherent picture like your sister's.  That they don't believe your mother is a HUGE problem but it's partly driven by doctors and others being under pressure to show results.  They're under intense observation in terms of how they use resources doing their jobs which means spend money and sometimes not even their own money.  Your real chance is to see if your feel for the landscape helps you find other health care providers with whom you can start fresh, but that's tough if your mother is already on the books in terms of what she says about your sister's younger years.  You as an adult may be a possibly credible source of information about this because even small children do get interviewed even by police when it's important enough and you're not a small child, only remember things from back then.  If you have any problems that could relate to your sister then how you related to your sister since you were born could get into the official record and have credibility BUT it has to be your real problems that really do relate to that.  Otherwise if there is someone else who may be having real problems in connection with your sister they can try to get help for themselves and that may get something moving but that also has to be real.  If it helps I know personally that a disabled relative is really tough to cope with for a long time and people's health does suffer.",,,1,0,0,

I lost both my legs, and pretty much all of that isnt wheelchair accessible.  It took me about a year of depression to grieve the loss.  After that, I decided I still wanted to find happiness and live a worthy life.

  I still have my upper body, so I worked on making that strong.  My wheelchair can roll on sidewalks fine, so I started training speed and endurance around town.  I found nature areas with accessible boardwalks to get a taste of trail hiking days.  In essence, I took what was left and I made it strong.

  Time to grieve is important and healthy.  Letting your sorrow out allows it a chance to dissipate and make room for acceptance.  After awhile though, you have a choice to make.  You can either continue to be miserable and angry, letting your sorrows consume you; or you can accept what's has been lost and turn your attention to what can still be.

  There is still so much open to you if you're willing to fight for it.  You might not be ready to start yet and that's completely fine, but do not forget that you can.

This is good, more mobility is always good but from what I've seen you sacrifice size &amp; maneuverability. The big challenge with terrain is soft ground and you can only improve that by getting a bigger footprint to reduce ground pressure. That bigger footprint helps in soft ground but it makes the chair bigger and increases rolling resistance indoors or on surfaces where it's otherwise not needed.

&gt; incorporate Artificial Intelligence

I could see this as maybe machine learning for some stability assist mechanism but ultimately why? What would AI actually do?

&gt; and Bluetooth/Wi-Fi

This would be nice but again to what end? Have you done background research on attempts to do this in the past and deploy it to market?

&gt; and virtually store a patient's history.

Using what protocols and retrieval mechanisms?

---------------------

While I think this is a possibly good idea as a daily user I don't see where this actually helps the user aside from buzzwords and a bunch of edge cases that assume a perfect system. Digital medical records are not standardized, nor close to it. The more research I do on them the more I find that the only good way to carry a medical is physical hardcopy. An ambulance is not going to be able to read your USB stick if they even know you have it. If the record is stored in some other software mechanism you'll be dead before the virus scan is done.

On the topic of Bluetooth and wifi I can see remote drive being nice but I'd rather see a proprietary RF or IR interface. Bluetooth and Wifi both open the door to roving security threats that cast a wide net like devices that read and store all RFID data in a certain area. The last thing you need is your chair getting a virus or becoming an asymptomatic virus-host that infects each network it connects to... and this can be reality because this happened with BMW cars.

Lastly the biggest issue faced and covered over and over is incorrect handling of chairs by untrained personnel. Airport baggage handlers and taxi drivers are not exactly reknown for their technical expertise with obscure or rare digital interfaces. For a simple example see how thrown people are when you hand an iPhone user an Android device despite the similarity... they can't use it.

I don't see anything that helps this in your list of items. Everything you mention adds to the complexity and requires more user training. You need to be going more minimalist, more simpler.",,,1,0,0,

I have never seen anyone calling for more disability. Your short description under the video indicates that you think the world has gone crazy that ""more disability is a good thing,"" and I don't think there is much evidence for this. 

We've reached a time where, sort of, people with disabilities are not shunned or thought of so much as ""other"", and instead are being a bit more accepted as part of society and not hidden away. 

Again, sort of. No one wants there to be more, or to wish their disabilities upon anyone. Who would? 

But I think you are misunderstanding the issue of representation, and in that understanding of it, seem like what you disagree with is what literally everyone disagrees with--that more disability is good. No one thinks so. Diversity, yes, in its way, but not actually more disability. 

I sometimes joke to people that 99% of the world's issues are caused by ableds, and in that sense, more disability is good, but I don't actually mean I wish there were more disabled people or that we outnumbered the ableds. 

We are barely scratching the surface of acceptance after many decades of anything but, and it sounds like you'd prefer to return to that past time. But again, I think that's only because (I hope) it's that you're confusing ""representation"" in media with ""I wish there were more disabled people in the world.

No one, especially disabled people, wish a greater number had to go through any of this.",,,25,0,0,

They could find nothing and nothing helped the pain and they gave me the good shit. I mention it bc I have barely being able to make myself carry on with my disabilty and now this random undiagnosable pain everytime I literally breathe... I no longer want to go on if this is a forever thing.

They couldnt even admit me into the hospital bc they ""have to have a solid diagnosis"". Then they tried to discharge me and found out that I'm homeless and jobless, and my car I've been living/couch surfing out of is in the shop (it's pointless tho I cant afford to fix whatever) because my brake line ""mysteriously"" broke (fuck that it got cut I think) and I nearly died the other day. (Think of any movie scene with cut brakes on an incline and that's what happened to me) I've got no family or emergency contacts, but Social Workers had already left for the day. So these gems of humans are hiding me in a random room until the social workers come back in the morning. 

I'm grateful for what they're doing but, I've long passed the end of my rope and I'm just not seeing the point anymore. I've become a burden on everyone which has always been my worse nightmare and what family I do have left dont give a flying fuck anyway. 

It's been so shit and negative lately (Think 1 step forward a million back) that last week I was on my feet for two days in a row 6 hrs each with no problem and i completely missed that massively positive milestone. Before Thursday i havent been able to stand even ten minutes aided or unaided without needing a rest in a year. 2-4 years since I was able to do 6 hrs straight without needing a lie down or any thing.

I should be literally jumping for joy, this is huge. But all the shitness, and finding out recently I have another life long disabling disease just takes it all away.

If doc's have cleared you for exercise, try to get out and do what you can.

At a point I had to say ""screw it"" and just do what was good for me. Getting outside on a nice day, walking, running, cycling, and swimming. Dx does say ""Ataxia"" but with Parkinson's there is more stuff going on.

I ride a recumbent trike (google ""Catrike 700"" to make sure you have the correct visual, most people don't think of racing and trikes).

For me it is ""transition"" from standing still to moving. Once I get going I can do pretty well, just starting or stopping is a challenge.

I'm the disabled person in an interabled relationship as well, and although I've been working fairly steadily for the past couple of years, the majority of our almost 9-year LDR saw me as mostly looking for work all the time and not finding anything I could do or people who would hire. It took a long time to find something. I say that not to depress you, but to show that I know what it is like to be an unemployed disabled person with an abled and employed partner. She's moved from one good job to the next every couple of years during our relationship, and I often felt as you do now. I still do, in many ways, but it is better since I've become employed.

I've occasionally felt like letting her go when things got tough because I felt like a burden, but that is not actually a fair thing to do. If the abled person finds the relationship burdensome, he or she will leave if they want to. We certainly don't guilt them into staying. Dumping someone because you feel like you're a burden to them and they'd be better off seems like some kind of noble act, but it actually takes the choice away from that person and makes assumptions about what they can handle and what they think about you without giving them the benefit of the doubt. Looked at from that way, I would not advise sabotage just because you think your partner might be better off in the long term.

Communication will be imperative and needs to be a firm foundation for your relationship, especially if you are living together.

While exercising patience is gracious, it's not an excuse for him to walk on you. Maybe a day of the week can be your girls' night out and his boys' night in or visa Versa. I know you just moved, but try to find friends outside of his. That doesn't mean you can't be friends with his friends (and he shouldn't stop you).

I'm a big fan of the love languages. I think it makes things a lot easier. My brain is too foggy to explain it, but its all a google away. Basically, its the big categories we want to be loved in.

(Ie I get Time and a Half. So if I have an hour exam I get an hour and a half to take it). First off verify with another classmate just how long the class normally gets. Once you know what you should be getting in accordance of your accommodations, print that out, highlight it, and show it to your professor if you can. Or highlight it and email it to them since you say this is online. Tell her if everyone gets 90 minutes your supposed to get something along the lines 135 minutes if we use my example. Tell her it is not the same and it will impact your grade if your not allowed the accommodation. It is extremely important to emphasise the fact that no accommodation means they are not getting the fullest out of your performance in fact your probably underperforming because of it. This isn’t about being a pain this is about being able to actually have a grade that reflects your true ability. Something everyone is allowed but you aren’t apparently. Accommodations are supposed to level the playing field for those at a disadvantage she appears to be taking away your ability to do so.

""To celebrate knocking on our 130,000th door, my team and I went for a roll through my community, tracking our route on Strava, a popular app for runners and cyclists. We tried our best to recreate a simple symbol that means a lot to me — the International Symbol of Accessibility ♿️. For me, this symbol represents overcoming barriers in our society that people with disabilities face in their day to day life.

Twenty-eight years ago, I was shot in a random act of gun violence and woke up a C5 quadriplegic. I was a 21-year-old student and college hockey player with hopes, dreams, and aspirations. That all came crashing down. I woke up on Oct 3 in a hospital bed with no feeling in 95% of my body.

It’s been a long road to get where I am today. With the support of my amazing family and friends, and a great healthcare system, I pulled through. I eventually left that hospital bed after seven months. I got a degree. I became a lawyer. I ran for office. I won — three times. I don’t think 21-year-old me, who lay terrified in that hospital bed, facing life in a wheelchair, would believe for a second that one day he’d be a federal politician, bringing Calgary’s voice to Ottawa.

My story is not unique. There are tons of inspirational people out there with physical disabilities, making great strides and accomplishing amazing things. While accessibility has come far from 30 years ago, there’s still more work to be done.""

I get it about tremors. Tremors were bad enough, but add social anxiety and they were off the roof.

So I learned to adapt. Eating out always find sticky rice (Chinese) or Potatoes or Grits (southern). Dipped my fork into something sticky so things like peas stay on them.  Soups were out, unless oriental style (both hands are used to tip the bowl to your mouth). Oddly enough I learned to use chopsticks (food goes into bowl with rice, bowl raised to your lips, chop sticks act like a shovel to move food/rice into your mouth).  So in every case a way to adapt. Oh friend was Chinese so she instructed me before hand, eating with her family was easy.  She was too polite to say anything, but her Grandfather had Parkinson's so I am sure her Dad recognized my tremors.

Essential Tremor is 10x more common than Parkinson's, btw. So tremors could mean anything.

It took years to even receive a proper diagnosis. I am now considered medically disabled, am unable to work, rely on a wheelchair, and my life is nothing like it was. I was angry and sad for quite a while. Actually, it was really grief. I was grieving for and mourning the loss of who I had been and the life I’d had before. It’s healthy to grieve a loss and there is nothing wrong with being sad or angry. Therapy has helped me work through the grief, and so did time and perspective. I miss who I was and what I had, the life I lived, but I needed to start living again. It was a process of finding things I could still do that are meaningful to me, that bring me joy and give me a sense of purpose (that is very important to me personally). It was reclaiming my life in small ways, finding adaptive ways to do some of the things I love, and allowing myself to see that this new life can have happiness and beauty in it too. I still get sad or angry, or grieve, at times and I allow myself to feel those feelings but not to get stuck there for too long.

1- The car. I wonder why he insists on keeping the wheelchair-compatible car. It's probably more expensive to run than a smaller car, but as far the law is concerned, it's not illegal to drive a gas guzzler.

2- The permit. I am in Canada, so our laws are different. Here, the disabled parking permit is owned by the disabled person, with the catch 5hat if said person is a child or mentally disabled person, then the placard is held by his *guardian(s)*. Transferring the placard between parents isn't covered by the law.

So (in Canada), if he has shared custody, then as long as he doesn't actually use the permit, he is ok. And the only thing the police will do (sometimes) is to give him a ticket for misuse if they catch him on the spot.

Quite frankly, I wonder if you have in Ireland a consumer show on television. I would say a short report by a program like CBC Marketplace, Radio Canada's La facture or Global TV 16x9 would make a lot of noise and get you the speediest results.

I'm not going to pretend I know enough about your life or your condition to give you any practical advice, but perhaps there is still some way you could support or participate in the communities you care about, even now, with this new, hard-earned perspective that you have.

One good way to stop this despair-spiraling that you are doing is to start concentrating on helping others.  Now that you are the disabled/""unhealthy"" one, all of the helping spotlight has been focused upon you instead of the other way around.  Sometimes when we have so much focus on our needs -- which is often necessary for those of us who have disabilities -- we lose a sense of what it feels like to be useful.  I understand that you want to feel useful again...but how do you do that when you are housebound?

From your post you obviously write well; you say you have a background in academia.  A couple of things you can start small with, and some things I've found satisfaction in, are online disability advocacy/activism, which includes writing about disability issues, and keeping tabs on disability forums to help connect people with resources they might not know exist.  A lot of disabled people depend on online forums for information exchange; I'm not sure what type of work you did before, but it sounds like you could still be useful to the community.  Does it pay?  No; does it bring satisfaction?  For me, yes, it does.  It may for you, too.",,,3,0,0,

bdf259a4-907a-4e5a-a6bb-6d35ef9a7ce1,1571694731,"What bothers me sometimes is when a movie or TV show has a character that is a wheelchair user that really doesn’t have to be. I don’t use a chair, but from what I hear, everyday common people don’t use one. What really makes me angry is when there is that kind of character who doesn’t seem to have any symptoms of any condition whatsoever. I understand that that can and is the case for some people, but when looked at through the context of the media, you know that isn’t the case. To me, it seems like the writers decided to be “inclusive” but failed miserably. The character would be entirely the same, and nothing would be impacted if this character wasn’t using a wheelchair. 

Another thing I see often is the exact opposite. There are characters who are portrayed as the stereotype of being “wheelchair bound”. These characters pretty much don’t do anything for themselves, and they’re sometimes portrayed as a burden, or impede the plot. It really paints a negative picture of these kinds of disabilities, and just people with disabilities as a whole.

Unfortunately it isn't as simple as naming a common condition or injury for me. It usually means a host of follow up questions or ""helpful"" advice. Sometimes now I just try to say ""I have constant pain and fatigue because of an illness, so this is my only way of getting around safely"" and try to redirect my attention to literally anything else. The amount of times people have asked 10+ follow up questions, or told me I should try x, y or z and I'll be much better... 


It's also something I've only been coping with later in life, starting in my early-mid 20s. It's now 8 years on and it seems to be happening more often. I've even had a bus driver confront me and ask why I need the scooter and to produce proof so I could board the bus. He was literally saying I don't look like I need it and asking what's wrong with me. I had my disabled parking permit and a scooter pass I use on the train, he did eventually let me on but told me I need a specific permit for those buses (which I'd been using for years, never heard that once, and when I went on the company website the link was dead and I got no response when I emailed them). 


Conversely, i dress in a fairly eccentric style and have colourful hair, I like it when people comment on that and compliment my style (often this seems to be older ladies, it brightens their day and I'll have a chuckle encouraging them to go for rainbow coloured hair or something). 


I feel it would be nice if people just treated us like they would treat other abled people, acknowledge the chair/nobility aid but don't focus on it. Like we wouldn't focus on their shoes or the way they walk or something like that? It's hard to think of the equivalent for an abled person. Or if they sneeze we don't ask what's wrong and pursue that line of questioning? 


I agree that being ignored by people too ashamed or embarrassed to look at us is an issue that needs to be addressed too. I think it's down to public attitudes, general perceptions, and individual anxieties. There's a difference between noticing and staring and they seem to find this easy to distinguish in themselves with abled people. Maybe education needs to change to include disabilities, inclusion, and how to interact with disabled people and be a helpful abled ally as opposed to a well meaning but overall unhelpful or even hurtful person. Like those who push people in wheelchairs without asking.

Anyone who knows anyone disabled knows that many do not zip in and out of restrooms. To have to have a mom with three squirmy crying kids waiting to get in after them doesn't work. So have plenty of disabled restrooms plenty of places and dont make it one joint family disabled one. Also plenty of disabled parking spots. Maybe a covered drop off spot so they dont get wet.

Also a welcoming attitude. Church people like others can gush over the supposedly perfect couples with great jobs who can contribute a lot financially and dress well and have the ability to host events at their home.

Dont ignore or marginalize disabled people. Try to genuinely get to know them rather than just a superfical kind of pitying relationship or kind of a condescending attitude.

If you ever ask a disabled person or caregiver how the disabled person or caregiver is and they dummy up and think you really want to know and accidentally spend a minute telling you, try not to show the horror on your face that they actually answered because they thought you were showing Christian concern.

Realize that in thirty seconds they will realize they made a mistake and shut up. But the look of horror on the persons face who asked and terror that they might have to listen for sixty seconds wont be forgotten. Also its even worse when church staff do this.

Also too, disabled people cant always afford the price of church dinners. To occasionally get an invite or free admission ticket to one for the person and their caregiver would be nice.

Do not give them the book when bad things happen to good people or whatever it is called. Do not tell them all about some disabled person you know. Don't tell them that they are an inspiration. Dont corner a disabled person because they arent very mobile to tell them all about your health problems.

Also don't try to sell them your supplements or vitamins if that is your side business. Don't discourage them if they are praying or believing for healing.

Be their friend if you can. Some even appreciate a joke or interesting story.

A lot of people who volunteer at church can be sort of gossipy or comdescending or judgemental. The demands and challenges disabled people and their caregivers face are inconceivable for most people. Dont get all judgemental if they return the church library book late, their car looks like it needs washed or whatever.

Going ""Ughhh I just can't write this thing I NEED to write in order to PASS and not have wasted TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS but I just can't move"" is a sign of mental illness. Usually shit like anxiety or ADHD.

Why? Because you are being prevented, by your brain, from doing something that is vitally important to your survival.


Can you push through? Yes, some people can. But having to PUSH is weird, HEALTHY people don't need to push when it comes to NECESSARY ACTION.
Some people can't push through. There's a whole host of mental shit related specifically to being unable to do things you need to do - like executive function issues.


Not being able to do shit you NEED to do to survive is a symptom of depression, anxiety, perfectionism, ADHD - heaps of shit.

Interestingly I had just gotten into the Hopkins system for what we thought was unrelated but turned out to make total sense once we had the full picture.

I was in the system from my ENT doctor refuring me for surgery. That second opinion confirmed what the first neruologist said, not MS. When we said where can we go from here he said there could be an element of Dysautonomia and set up the tilt test to rule that out. 

The tilt table test, I had done at John's Hopkins. It's a really simple test but so few hospitals offer it. After the test was over I had a diagnosis immediately. A lot of people know about pots and there is a type that causes adrenaline surges and can raise BP the way you describe. I actually have NMH as my diagnosis, which some people say contradicts any pots diagnosis, but I also have hypertension so another contradiction. Since getting a diagnosis I've done some further testing like an event monitor and a holter monitor and a stress test echo to name a few.

I actually am completely dependent on my family to cover food, housing, utilities, hygiene products, etc. I want to get rid of the car, but I owe more than it's worth. I got the car when I had a good paying job. I lost the job because of my disability. 

My local section 8 charges rent at 30% your monthly income. I don't have that. What's worse is that I live in an emotionally and financially abusive household and would love to get out, but I am completely dependent.

I'm sorry, this is a lot of information and I'm probably just coming across as making excuses, but these are my circumstances. I'm not really looking for a magic fix or a place to vent. I just want to know if there is a way to make more than $771 from SSI, the maximum the federal government gives for a single person like me.",,,6,0,0,

That is definitely something they should have discussed with you when the accommodations were being made. Could you go to the department head about this?

They could help you navigate this as well. Honestly you may also be at a point that you need legal advice.

a82bb553-721a-45e3-a70b-3284a1cb9e02,1571984877,"I used to go to the Catholic Church, I was raised in it. My local church does a good job in terms of being accessible for my wheelchair to get into the building and out of the building quickly and easily, the parking is excellent, and I feel like the people there are pretty welcoming and understanding of my situation.

One of the problems is that during Mass the only place for me to sit in my chair is against the back wall. My family maybe 10 or 15 pews ahead of me and so we were never able to worship as a family. My husband even asked for a couple of folding chairs to line up along the back wall with me so that he and my children could be sitting next to me, but apparently they’re considered a fire risk.

Another problem arose in that Catholic churches love their basements. They offer educational programs, holiday programs, parties, bingo, all kinds of community events, in the basement. There is no elevator, I’ve never seen an elevator in any Catholic Church I’ve ever attended. So I’m unable to attend any of those programs because at best I can go up and down one step.

That would leave you with some quiet time to soak up the culture at a local cafe, park, etc. Or just chill in the room.

Next is to know your limits, and if needed plan to bring or rent a mobility aid so that you can enjoy yourself without overdoing it. It means a lot of research before you leave so you know what things are accessible and what you may struggle with. 

Don't try to see everything. Depending on the length of the trip, pick 1 or 2 cities to visit, and base yourself there. Don't plan on seeing much on the days you arrive or depart.

47dd1743-0426-4bbb-ae17-ff29ef10f847,1572174048,"The worst part is that SSA watches you like a hawk. My daughter recived SSI, and we had to live with family and get state aid just to survive. We also have to prove that she's still disabled every few years. And after I met and married my husband, I got in trouble for not reporting that I got married (I thought that I only had to notify SSA if/when my daughter ever gets married), and I got into additional trouble when I had a job and didn't report it (again, I thought it only applied to if/when my daughter gets a job). Now I'm paying back what SSI allegedly overpaid, and I have to report any income from work my husband or I do and any child support I receive. And they always go by our income before taxes when determining if they'll help my daughter each month. I'm disabled, too, but I've never applied for disability for myself because I was told that the process was very hard for adults, and I can't afford a lawyer.

 What really sucks is that our rent is over half of what my husband brings home in net income each month, yet we somehow fall into that spot where we make too much to get state aid, but not enough to climb out of working paycheck to paycheck. I'm looking for steady work so that we can climb out of this hole and not need the help from SSI each month, but we have a five-month-old baby (the surprise little sister my daughter always wanted), and her sleep schedule is still erratic, so it's hard to know when I can work. I'm trying to find something I can do while caring for her.

Bottom line, the system seems designed to keep disabled people in poverty and punishes people for getting married and getting jobs. What upsets me most is that the money isn't for me-it's for my daughter, and I feel like she's being screwed over because the system isn't designed to assist disabled people in escaping poverty.",,,17,0,0,

That's a legitimate question. Unfortunately, keeping rent down means living somewhere relatively remote, and that means significant expense. There's also the significant marginal expense of not shopping at the discount grocers or Costco. 

Assuming a \~$1-$2 tip (grumpy drivers can 1-star you for not tipping; get enough low ratings and you're booted - permanently!) you can hit $30 roundtrip to the nearest discount grocer pretty quickly; you can save $10-$12 going to Target or the local Kroger subsidiary, but you'll spend even more for the privilege of shopping there. The more often you shop over a larger area, the less you pay - and I'm used to shopping @#$@! everywhere to keep costs down.

As for medical transportation, that's definitely the deciding factor. For some incomprehensible reason, most of the specialists are all in outpatient facilities in the middle of nowhere - seriously, there's cornfields next to the parking lot. I've picked up a lot of $20-$25 tabs traveling *one way* for these.

The easiest thing I can suggest would be to see if the end of your sink faucet unscrews. If it does (and is a standard size), you should be able to attach a hand-held showerhead (garden hose and nozzle work too) and at least give yourself more bathing freedom. If you want to get super clever, you can build a little shower stall out of PVC and dollar store plastic drop cloths. Just make sure you've got a plan for the wastewater.

If you happen to have a garage, there's no reason not to empty it out, put in a small pool and use that for bathing.

Dry shampoo and body wipes can be a blessing. This one is more dependent on personal body chemistry, but if you've got hair that can take dry shampoo and can find a body wipe that doesn't irritate you, these things can go miles in making you feel better. Bonus points, there are many recipes for home made dry shampoo online.

There are also manual washing machines that look akin to giant salad spinners which do quite a decent job, if in small loads. It's literally something that can be done while watching TV as all you're doing is turning a crank (they may make electric versions as well). If your outerwear is unstained, fabreeze or it's generic equivalent can often be applied at end of day and the clothing hung to air, allowing for another day of use.

bdd626bc-838b-4c34-9b21-6ab469700c7c,1569949102,"Here are some different examples of ableism to help you understand how it is different from discrimination

A woman fractures her spine. She is a restaurant manager. She is capable of working but her employers won't let her wear her brace while working in the dining room because they don't like looking at it and think it will make guests uncomfortable to see. They won't let her keep it in the office where she can access it more easily when not in the dining room because they think of it as ""clutter"" when she's not actively using it and find it annoying. They could simply get the fuck over it because she needs this to heal, but they would rather inconvenience her, the disabled person, instead of accommodating her

It's not discrimination, she's not being discriminated against. They're just being ableist. Ableism is when abled people put the onus on the disabled person to operate in their capacity without making accomodations for them, especially when operating in their capacity isn't even necessary

Ableism is when my boss complains to me, the autistic employee that made requests for accomodations that will make it possible for me to operate better at my job, about how ""everyone"" wants accomodations without putting the work in to ""earn"" it. It's not discrimination, it's him being an asshole.

Sadly the semi permanent dye didn't last well in the longer parts of my hair so yeah I'm half blond now haha! 


I would be more goth but honestly it is a lot of effort. I'm currently decorating my scooter with Halloween  things because October is my month for this. I make it festive in December too. I do love when people comment on that kind of thing, like yes I made effort on this.


I do feel quite self conscious being in the scooter, your friend's experience is like my nightmare, but thankfully almost invariable I find people who interact with me to be understanding and helpful (eg holding doors if they're ahead of me or helping me pick up something I've dropped). Yet I've caught people glaring at me on the bus. Probably doesn't help that I have my crutches in the bag on the back. I fear standing up to get things off high shelves because people could think I'm faking and I'll end up as a meme like ""miracle in aisle 4"" or whatever (I've seen this with a woman in a manual chair standing to get an item from a shelf, someone took a picture from behind her and shared it around as proof she was ""faking"")


Worse though is being in a manual chair - I feel like if I move my legs at all someone is going to think I'm faking, because in their minds the only people who need wheelchairs are amputees and paralysed people. I rarely use the manual because my arms are too weak and painful to power myself, but sometimes I need to with small venues and I'll have my husband push me.


My sister in law is very similar too. Always coourful hair, usually 50s style dresses in punk/goth fabrics, piercings, tons of tattoos all over her arms and legs. She goes to a lot of small concerts and often gets to meet the bands and finds everyone there so accepting and helpful. She makes a lot of friends easily, she always has, yet I bet people still ask her about the chair. (We haven't talked about this directly tbh).

1. I have no motor function in my feet, so I can't straighten out my toes if they get bent under. This means that I can't wear most shoes, because the process of shoving my feet into them virtually guarantees my toes get bent somehow. And since someone else has to put them on me, and they can often be too rough without knowing, I have to wear easy to get on shoes, like clogs, to avoid getting injured.

2. My feet swell up during the day, so I can't really wear cute sandals without my feet turning into potatoes.  I need shoes to keep my feet compressed, meaning they have to enclose my foot. It's difficult to square Requirement 1 with Requirement 2.

3. I am a very tiny adult. If I find a style that I can get my feet into in my size, it's usually pink and sparkly.

Right now I have three styles of shoes that I can wear: clogs (not ideal because they tend to slide off my feet when going over bumps in my wheelchair), open-toed sandals that cover the rest of my feet (hard to find in tiny sizes), and Billy Footwear flats. https://billyfootwear.com/collections They are easy to get into, don't fall off my feet, and they aren't cold in winter, but the choice of styles is extremely limited and not very professional looking.

I have SSDI, and I racked up ~$22k in student debt going to college. I ignored it for years, because I knew they couldn't garnish my wages, but it was moreso because I was just embarrassed to go to a doctor and ask for him to fill out a form to say I was disabled and couldn't work. 

Then Obama came along, signed an executive order and simplified what Jimmy Carter signed back in the 70s. All I had to do was sign a letter sent out by the student load people, and that was it. Telnet controls my debt now. 

Essentially how it all works, is I sign that sheet of paper, mail it back, and that's pretty much it. The student debt stopped killing my credit score. Only catch is I can't work for 3 years.

I would contact your HR/Benefits department and ask for clarification on how the plan works given your WFH situation.  I recall reading somewhere that in a WFH situation, you are evaluated according to the office you are affiliated with when it comes to FMLA.  You may be OK on that depending on your home office employee count and your work hours for the past year.

I'm not sure about paragraph 2.  That reads oddly.  I think LTD plans generally run until you are no longer deemed disabled or until you reach what they consider your retirement age.  Again, I'd ask for clarification here from your HR/Benefits person.

Good luck.

Edit... Found the WFH info. I don't  know how to paste a link, bit here's the relevant info:

""The FMLA regulations do not define “worksite.” However, Section 825.111(a)(2) of the regulations, which address how to determine whether 50 employees are employed within 75 miles, states:

An employee’s personal residence is not a worksite in the case of employees, such as salespersons, who travel a sales territory and who generally leave to work and return from work to their personal residence, or employees who work at home, as under the concept of flexiplace or telecommuting.  Rather, their worksite is the office to which they report and from which assignments are made.

Therapy, if you can.  Time and self-reminders, if you can't.

Absolutely.  You don't need to be government-standard-disabled to have a disability - mental or physical.

I think it's up to every individual to introspect and question what aspects of their disabilities are actually disabling and what aspects are conditioned and put there by abled people

I'm Autistic and while some sensory issues are overwhelming at times, generally speaking I would sooner say other people disable me more than Autism does. I have some coordination issues that make it a challenge for me to do a lot of things, like makeup, painting, playing guitar etc. It's inconvenient and frustrating at times, but so is life. Having wavy/curly in-between hair is inconvenient and frustrating at times, but that doesn't make me wish my hair type didn't exist. 

I have some hypermobile joint issues that make me consider that I may require the use of mobility aids in the future, and I won't consider being in a wheelchair as large a disability as the failure of abled people to provide adequate access. Many of us arent disabled by being in a wheelchair, we're disabled by exclusion. Being Deaf is another complicated one: Deaf communities can and do get by just fine, and the entire world could be Deaf friendly if hearing people could be a little more considerate and integrate technology that is already accessible for the masses into their lives, literally the tech exists, we just need able people to actually implement it

Disabled people are conditioned to feel like burdens, as though we are the problem and we need to put in the work to keep up with abled people. I'm unlearning this concept, instead I'm trying to see it as humans being a big team, where we may struggle in some areas, we help in others. Our ability to contribute depends on others helping us so we can help them. And contributing, strictly speaking, isn't necessary and can look anyway. If all you do is offer support for others like yourself, that's bigger than it seems.

I think in general, late onset illness is a separate thing from disability, and degenerative conditions are a further separate issue. I would understand if someone with a degenerative condition stated that they wished their condition didn't exist",,,4,0,0,

My point here is that yes, I often go through moments feeling like I'm not ""validly disabled"" enough to use aids like scooters or even walkers, because I would be ""cloying for attention or sympathy"" (that's what my brain tells me anytime I think about using the motorized carts at grocery stores, even if I could cry from pain).

Honestly, I am not sure. I do know they look at notes from psychiatrists in order to determine symptoms, diagnosis, signs of things that indicate an inability to work - job history, housing situations, evaluations on one's ability to care for themselves well enough to live and work independently (many severe mental illnesses can bar from employment for a variety of reasons - from reported symptoms and triggers to even ability to keep up on hygiene. They likely will need to look through all of your mental health information in order to make an accurate determination of disability status - and because these cases, like mental health treatment, do in fact vary from person to person. I do know that it takes a good long while to get an answer - in my area, 3 years is not uncommon, but 5 months also isn't unheard of to be awarded disability. I also do know that the people who look on your file are required to keep that between you, your doctor, and them. They do not tell this information to people who are not important in their investigation.

So again, I don't know a hundred percent sure, but I would absolutely expect that they would, purely from the viewpoint of figuring out the extent of your mental health issues and your eligibility for financial assistance. Make sure, if/when they get around to interviewing you (for whatever reason, I was never interviewed) you make sure you can communicate the extent of your mental issues and living situations. They likely will ask pretty personal questions in this area, and they have the right to do so as part of their investigation. This is to properly determine the kind of help, if any, you are actually entitled to through their agency.",,,1,0,0,

It seems down below that what you really have an issue with is ""marginalizing the majority."" Why are you offended on their behalf? They are more than capable of being offended by and at disabled people without help from disabled people.

EDIT: In the context of issues surrounding the disabled community, the primary difference between that community and all the others is that they are non-disabled--in other words, abled. Of course when one group of people talk about others who are outside that group, they differentiate between them somehow. Whether it is ""able-bodied,"" or just ""abled,"" it is a signifier meant to denote the primary difference between this community and the others.

I was really fit and healthy, pretty strong too as I could easily carry my now husband on my back while wearing 6 inch heels. I loved being active, I loved creating costumes and sewing and making props, I might not have enjoyed my work entirely but I was up to Assistant Manager in an outdoor clothing and equipment store, in one of the busiest locations they had. So I was doing great.  


Then it all slowly declined with Fibromyalgia, likely triggered by a minor back injury at work which took a few days to actually come out because that's how torn muscles work so it was never listed as an incident... Basically some idiot had put a heavy box on the top of the delivery pallet so when I took off the cling film wrap the box started to fall and I twisted to catch it so it didn't fall on my head. The twist tore 4 muscles up my back, but the lower back never healed and I ended up with pain in my hip too.   
Turns out I had some minor lower back damage too but nowhere near enough to cause the pain I felt, because Fibro likes to amplify every kind of pain it can. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had to leave my job when I was struggling because I had 2 flights of stairs to the stockroom and staff room/office, and I had to be on my feet all day and up and down ladders. I was on 2 walking sticks by my mid 20s and not able to handle walking much at all. I started to be house bound until my now mother in law gave me a second hand mobility scooter - that right there was freedom back again. 

&amp;#x200B;

***It is really worth looking for second hand mobility scooters, they can be quite cheap from people selling privately and most only need a new battery, if that. (Batteries are about £50 ish for most).***

&amp;#x200B;

Now basically I have either a wheelchair or a walking frame for inside the flat, and a new mobility scooter for outside the house which has a higher back captain chair and suspension (I had a backpayment of PIP because I had to appeal their stupid decision which was based on total lies from the assessment report), I can walk maybe 10-15m very slowly with crutches or walking frame. I have been in CONSTANT pain for 6-7 years and it is EXHAUSTING, I have been through endometriosis which the operation to treat it left me with urinary incontinence, I've had a DVT and found out I'm a lot more susceptible to them due to a genetic fault (Factor V Leiden, heterozygous) so I have to stay well hydrated (which isn't always helpful for the incontinence, having to keep drinking more while out and about and not near a toilet...), I'm on a ton of painkillers (I live on paracetamol, gabapentin, and tramadol, with morphine for emergency aka not every day use for when it's unbearable), I'm constantly cold (even in Summer I often needed a blanket on the sofa), my husband had to leave work to be my full time carer, pain flares up wherever it wants whenever it wants so one day my hands are find then suddenly I can barely lift a half pint glass of drink because all the joints hurt and stay this way for up to 3 months.....

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fecking **32**. I feel like I'm **82**, despite the fact there are 82 year olds able to do way more than I can. I look around at my friends and family and I'm jealous and sad, I just can't do anything I used to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am very lucky to have my husband though as he takes care of me and has taken over all housework etc without complaint, he only asks for more cuddles in return. He helps me to be as independent as I can and yet is there for everything when I can't. It may be undignified to have him half carry me to the toilet and help me do everything except wipe, but at least he is here and will do it all. I have friends too who are more than happy to just come to our flat and play board games and tabletop RPGs like D&amp;D.  


TL;DR It's a rant. I'm just so frustrated to be in never ending pain and unable to do anything I used to be able to do. I remember being fit and strong and I think in some ways in my mind I'm still that person so it is so hard to accept sometimes that I'm not.",,,2,0,0,

Just in case it might help you or anyone else. I’ve mentioned before that I had a lawyer working with me on my initial application. One of the things she told me was to keep copies of every medical record I sent to SS. I asked for copies for myself from every doctor. So I had the entire package SS was supposed to have, just in case they *somehow lost parts of my records*. If anyone who’s applying doesn’t have those copies, try to get them. Your doctor is legally obligated to give them to you if you ask; at most, they can charge you the cost of making photocopies. 

While I’m handing out advice, I’ll add this: My lawyer said the single most helpful thing I could have in my application was a letter from my doctor to SSA stating that I needed Disability. As it happens, one of my doctors is a world champion letter writer, and I was able to get a second doctor to add a note to her letter, saying he agreed. I think that’s a large part of the reason I got accepted on my initial application. I’m passing this advice on for free (since I got it for free myself) in case it helps anyone else.

OP, I’m very sorry to hear about your lawyer.  We all know SSA doesn’t review applications objectively; they’re looking for a reason to say no. But your psych guy was still way out of line. Definitely submit a complaint about him—both about his hostile attitude during the interview, and the objectively false summary he  wrote. Express concern that he seems to have mixed up your file with someone else’s. And while you’re looking for a new lawyer, get hold of copies of all medical records SSA is supposed to have, but claims not to. I’m so sorry you’re having such a shitty time with this.",,,6,0,0,

I don't have CP but was also born with my disability and it's gotten worse as I've aged. I'm not you and no-one is but I hope I come from a point of view close to yours. 

Something I really want you to hold onto here. 14 is shit. 14 is shit for nearly everyone except the super popular kids with supportive parents. It does not make your experience any less. I know at your age I felt so, so alone, because I was going through the normal teenage shit but as someone broken from birth, and I didn't know anyone else like me. I didn't know what normal was. It's super hard but remind yourself as often as possible that 14 is a clusterfuck. I'm more than twice your age and everyone I know agrees 14 is a mess in very different ways, not all of them objectively equal.

Your gf. I know you care about her or you wouldn't have mentioned her. Maybe you love her, I don't know. But at 14 you cannot look after her. You have to look after yourself first because if you can't cope, how can you look after anyone else? You first, then you can help other people. You're worried about your gf, talk to her parents. If you're worried about how her parents treat her, talk to a teacher or a social worker and tell them you think her parents are the problem. You cannot deal with someone else's problems on your own. 

What is worrying you about the blind school? I cannot drive and flew for the first time this year, something I never thought I'd be able to do. You don't know what's in front of you. The blind school may find new ways to do things that you hadn't thought of. If you can think of a different way, tell them! Nothing went forward by people keeping their thoughts to themselves.

I am a fan of dry shampoo. Brands like batiste and shhh! Can be found at Target, Walmart, five below.  IT'S BEST applied before bed, so it's absorbing oils overnight, comb out in the morning.

I have long hair that I sleep with it in braids or two buns on either side of my head. Don't put your hair up tightly, or you risk traction alopecia.

Using a wide tooth comb on wet washed hair with a leave in conditioner will help battle Frizz.


...................................................................

Clean and odor free:

The parts of you that stink are going to be creases and folds; so daily with mild soap (I like a small bit of dr. Bronner's of your preferred scent mixed with a basin of warm water, use a washcloth to apply to your dirty areas, then wipe with a rinse water rag twice to remove soap and dirt, then pat dry.

Areas of focus:

Face, neck, chin (especially creases if you have a double or triple chin),

Armpits

Under breasts/between breasts if you have big boobs.

Belly button

Genitals/groin, lifting under your gut if you have one,

Butt crack, under-cheeks if you have a big butt,

Hands

Feet.

For any open sores, clean according to your doctor's instructions. I have lymphedema which has a smell when it leaks. I use abdominal pads to soak up most of the liquid and medipore to cover the whole pad and adhere it to my skin. If it's very bad smelling, I change the dressing twice a day using skin prep pads to avoid skin tears, before applying the adhesive. Then I'll wrap that area with a clean roll of reusable fabric bandage and I have sometimes sprayed the fabric with a bit of febreeze on the side not touching my skin, or kept inexpensive activated charcoal packets tucked under the fabric but above the dressing, if that makes sense. 



Looking your best re: skin flaking;

If your skin is flaking constantly and you don't have a diagnosed reason, your skin is most likely too dry, or you are not exfoliating well. I exfoliate twice a week by taking a long shower, but if you can use a bath to save water, that's better. (I can't get out of a bath on my own.)

Let your skin soak/become wet for 10+ minutes.

I use both a product exfoliant, (exfoliating body wash + scrub), and once that's done well I use a Korean body scrub washcloth like this :

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SG4YWYL/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_awdb_t1_p9RKDbDQZ4C7H

You can find them online or at Daiso for a dollar or so each, they're machine washable and very effective. You don't have to apply a ton of pressure and they don't damage living skin, only the dead skin. 

After I have rinsed, I use a body oil or body cream, depending on the time of year and how my skin is behaving. A lotion with lanolin, cocoa butter, or almond oil should do well. I like natural lotions best. 

As for clothes that look good, I find I feel best about myself in a maxi-cut skirt, as long as it's not so, long or loose it catches my wheelchair wheels. I look dressed up without having to have freshly shaved legs or a perfectly toned form. I pair bright skirts with a simple blouse that's roomy but conservatively cut, and then I pair a cardigan,  denim jacket, or blazer if it's likely to be cold. I'm in clothes that are soft fabrics, not restrictive, and I look put together.

Simple jewelry like earrings OR a necklace, a ring, and a watch on opposite hands, plus a coordinating purse helps you look put together.

I also buy pretty patterned skirts to pair with a solid top, or I wear a patterned top with white jeans and a black blazer, etc.

Alternatively, a monochromatic look can be great, black pants, black pumps, white blouse, black purse? Add a red beaded chunky necklace, tiny silver and pearl ring, red headband or glasses, and tie a red and white scarf to the handle of your tote and you've gone from ” Olive garden waitress” to ” put together."" 

Keep a lint roller or brush in your car or tucked into a bag to clean off crumbs, pet hair, etc.

If not I will talk briefly about how I got labelled as permanently disabled in the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP). I applied and was lucky enough to get approved on my first round, but was classified as a temporary disability that would need to be reassessed, which happened after 3 years of getting approved. Basically I filled out the self evaluation forms in as much detail as possible (provided extra pages for the long answer questions), and had my health care team refill out my medical evaluation. I had developed more symptoms likely from new illnesses and was still struggling with the original ones, so after completing the re-evaluation I was reclassified as a permanent disability. 

I am aware I was on the luckier side, I know people with degenerative conditions like MS and Fibro who 16 years later have to reassessed still every 3 years.

But what really gets me is that I’m really lucky to live in DC and have access to some of the most respected doctors in their fields. And while my neuro doesn’t specialize in rheumatic conditions exactly, he does specialize in movement disorders and autoimmune neurology so it’s not like he’s out of his wheel house. Also he has several papers published through NIH and Hopkins and during our appointments on several occasions he will just call a doctor that wrote about a condition he’s looking into and say his name and get right through. So it really bothers me that this rheum who is an older man that’s also pretty well established but doesn’t have the same level of clout would just flat out reject it and not even take the time to collaborate. It just speaks volumes to me that my neuro will work on my case outside of my appointments and always meets me with 3-4 publications to discuss while my rheum took a quick glance at my blood work and made a decision right there  and his decision is the one my insurance goes with.

However, it is also possible that your view of the job identified is less than completely accurate.

That's really unfortunate and something I would definitely bring up with the disability workers when you see them. I'm in the UK but recording lectures for students was standard here when I was in uni 15 years ago. Smartphones weren't a thing back then so we were given recorders, there's no excuse now. I had to sign something saying I wouldn't share the recordings with students as then no-one would come to lectures. If the lectures do not include graded material they should still be learned as part of a rounded education (as they can't test everything in an exam) but are not essential. 

Some profs are more firm than others about this, from their standpoint you need to know the extra to have an overall knowledge of the subject vs learning enough just to pass the exam. You could try asking your prof for extra reading material to cover the content you miss, some respond well to that. Some are difficult just because, I worked in uni support services and while unfortunate it happens. 

Would it help you to get a ride to class and a comfortable seat? If your lectures are in inaccessible places can they switch the room? If you're immediately post-op in hospital there's not much you can do other than get a classmate to bring you notes or email recordings. (Been there, I sympathise.) If it's a pain/comfort issue they may be able to find a way to get you to class for those profs who are more reluctant to provide accommodations, at least until you get somewhere with the disability workers. Unfortunately cases against this kind of thing tend to take a long time to resolve so if you can get a temporary solution in the meantime I'd take it, just to prevent the gap in your education.",,,1,0,0,

She's not really into dancing, but she does like to travel, and her favorite style of traveling involves a lot of walking. We sometimes travel together when we are together (the Atlantic mostly separates us for most of the year) but she will often plan travels on her own and when we are together more consistently, I expect this to continue. 

Not because she doesn't want to hang out with me--she does--but because there will be times where she wants to do travels ""her way"" and that is just incompatible with ""my way"" no matter how badly I wish that were not so. To expect her to just not travel, or to only travel in the restrictive way that I do, would be controlling and ultimately sap some of the joy from her life. I could never do that. I've even thought of traveling completely on my own so I don't inconvenience anyone else. 

I know I am only addressing part of your post here, but my point is that if he cares about you, although it is fine to be bummed or sad that you might occasionally do things he cannot, he should not put a lot on you to make you feel like you're being inconsiderate or that you shouldn't go. I have a lot of baggage too, but most importantly, I want my s/o to be happy and live life with me in a way that brings her the most joy. If you like dancing, you should be able to do that.

In 1993 I had a progressive career including union membership but had significant anxiety.  A locum for my family doctor told me ""There's nothing wrong with you medically"" because he silently felt I was weaseling for some personal gain.  Then in January 1996 I became so anxious that I quit a job as adjudicator at Worker's Comp because that medical advice had been foundational to me and I blamed myself.  My boss's boss, the director, presented the option of LTD but it was up to me.  Nope, I felt I didn't deserve LTD because supposedly there was nothing wrong with me.

I got back on my feet but ten years later in 2006 crashed and burned mentally and got disability lightning fast--I mean one month from application to approval.  That's unheard of even in this province of Canada for mental health stuff.  Since then there's been physical diagnoses that put an exclamation mark on that but at least my small handout is stable until I'm of mandatory retirement age if I live that long.

It's really, really tough to say who did me the bigger favour here.  At the WCB I would have been shuffled to other jobs as I saw that done with a manager  who got booted from management and kept doing other things.  Not sure how things turned out for that guy but he's long retired if his health hung in there.  Would I have wanted that life when I sort of lived it despite having one job for more than the last eight of those 10 years between 1997 and 2006?

My fibro is mild compared to what I've heard from others, so I've never needed to use a wheelchair or a cane, even if it was a bad day I'm too stubborn to depend on someone pushing me around bc of anxiety over lack of personal bodily control. Though sitting for long periods of time, especially in an airplane environment, gives me increasingly extreme pain the longer I sit, and paired with ADHD it's a nightmare.

For pain, usually happens at night, but ffs- traveling, I take simple, store bought ibuprofen because we haven't been able to acquire xrays for an official diagnosis. And unfortunately, when I'm having these extreme bouts of pain, advil is not very useful to me.

I can tell you something of my situation, and it may help, but I don't think there is a good answer of what you ""should"" do, to be honest. 

I started getting SSI at uni, so I was already moved out, and after I graduated, I was only back home long enough to find a place to rent, at which point, I moved again. During that time, I came up for a voucher, so I moved out of my rental home and into the apartment. After student teaching and some years of searching for work, I am now employed although the work is not always steady. My SSI has been reduced to pretty much nothing as I make too much of course. That's fine, since I make enough, but it happens. 

My disability is physical, so I have no idea about how yours might affect you. I don't know if there are things that the evaluators look for when you are under review to try to say you are not disabled in the case of schizophrenia. But it is more about the ability to work, as you know. Is there something that makes you think it's likely that you could lose your SSI if you move out?

This next part is based only on my limited experience, which only pertains to physical disability, but if you have been found to be unable to find work at all, I see no reason to assume your SSI would stop if you move out. If you can work some, it can create a buffer that makes living on your own and with SSI less risky. But only you know if that can happen. So, that's just my experience and by no means any kind of legal advice or guarantee.",,,2,0,0,

They gave me 3 days of Percocet when I fell breaking both arms and a gash in my forehead. Then they expected me to transition to ibuprofen, and only prescribed 10 more pills (3 days worth) when I ended up back in their office in tears.

When I was suffering with herniated discs some months later, again they prescribed high dose ibuprofen and physical therapy. The ibuprofen barely made a dent, and the pain started radiating to my hips and thighs. At that point they reluctantly moved on to muscle relaxers, which thankfully stopped the spasm which was a big part of the problem.

My feeling is that because of this whole opioid “crisis”, these doctors no longer feel empowered to do what’s right because they might be blamed if something goes wrong. I don’t deal well with pain, so it particularly pisses me off when I think of all the doctors who recklessly prescribed and all the people who abused legitimate medication in order to get high. These events led us to the point we’re at.

I recently read, and it sounds accurate, that relief for pain will hardly be possible through your family doctor anymore. To establish proper treatment in chronic pain management it is recommended to attend a clinic that specializes in pain management. Depending on your health plan you may be referred by your doctor or self. Hopefully they might be more focused on getting you out of pain, and keeping you out of it. Good luck.",,,5,0,0,

While I don’t recommend it I ended up spending many hours researching my symptoms until I finally found something that fit. I finally did get the diagnosis.

My point being that it can take a while, but you should be provided with a diagnosis eventually for your condition. If the treatment that is being recommended doesn’t work then they’ll have to continue looking. It is extremely frustrating, but it is how the game is played. I also found that if a doctor of a supposedly lesser specialty came up with something that seemed quite possible and plausible but then sent me to the specialist for that particular thing they would negate that diagnosis immediately.

Just think I am confusing anxiety with an imaginary disorder.  If I am getting around ""well"" in my wheelchair I am accused of not needing it.  If I am out with the walker I get the why are you using that look cuz I am in my 30s.  The fact that I am so dizzy I trip over nothing and face plant every two feet without it doesn't occur to others except for the nurses that have to help me long term.  If I am feeling well enough to go out without a lot of extras I get told I must be faking being ill from family and friends.  Some of the family seem to think that I am perfectly fine and will be fine now forever.  Like Jesus came down and fixed me in my sleep.  I have to tell them that I am just having a good pain day or good symptom day and to calm down.  I can't stand up long enough to cook for myself.  The heat from the stove has caused me to pass out.  The last thing I want to do is cook alone at home cuz if I go down which can happen from the lovely ikea bar stool I sit on in the kitchen I can really hurt myself there.  Just leaving the house is bad enough.  I react to sunlight, the vibration of the car ride, any smells, bright lights, being startled, food, lack of food, and so much more.  I still leave the house I just do so for very short periods of time.  The only bit of independence I have comes from my mobility scooter.  I can strap myself in with a heating or cooling vest depending on the time of year and can go around around the block just by myself.  I can't drive a car, drink, or do much that is fun.  I get super confused during an allergic reaction so I don't want to go far without someone that can tell the EMTs why a woman that looks perfectly fine stopped breathing and is so confused she can't tell you her name or phone number.  I have my emergency contact info on my fitbit but for some reason it is never seen in an emergency.

The people that are the worst about my disputably are my family.  Husband and his family are great but it is mine that are the problem.  I think the Christmas they got the ""lovely hand made soap"" was the worst.  I am allergic to smells.  I have to special order my soaps cuz I react to so much.  I provided them a list of appropriate gifts.  Seriously I would have been fine if they got me a tiny $2 pack of sewing needles you all.  There were a ton of items on there for $5 or less and they could have gotten me any one of them and I would have cried tears of joy.  Instead I get presented with a basket of soaps that they got from the last minute gift fair the week before.  Don't know why they needed to tell me where they came from.  I could smell this thing before it was handed to me.  I had my husband put it in the cooler with the food in the car.  I could still smell it.  On the drive home we had to stop and get ziplocks to nest them in cuz I almost had to epi.  Luckily rescue inhaler and oral benadryl got me through.  Get them home and I call my grandma in tears.  I can't store them at the house.  She said she would pick them up but I ended up shipping them to her just to get the smell away from me.  This shit is the type of thing that just keeps happening.  I have given up and they can give me a steam gift card or nothing this year.  I have been telling them flat out that if it smells I am leaving it at the party.  I can't keep trying to be nice.

Years ago, it was difficult to combine a security door with an automatic door opener. This is because the automatic door opener can only work when the door is unlocked.

Today, it is much easier. There are plenty of locks that can be opened via an app on a key fob or pin pad.

I'm a nice guy (Hopefully not the wrong kind) but nice seems not a lot to offer when essentially with relationships you are asking somebody to get involved emotionally, mentally and  maybe even physically with you and make you a big part of their lives and in return for that you can offer....being nice and pleasant to be around. Seems one-sided and unfair to them, at least to me.

 Maybe I'm wrong, but I do know I'm so lonely for any kind of relationship. All I see are doctors, nurses, or family. That's it. I appreciate all of them greatly and I'm thankful for them but it's just not the same as a real relationship with a romantic partner you love and who you know loves you.

7249da8a-29b4-4b8a-a8c3-9058db0a3175,1569989001,"My whole life up until very recently. This is the danger of the idea of ""laziness"" - I've been sick since birth but never knew I was because everyone said I was lazy and a wuss for blowing things out of proportion. I thought I was faking it and not trying hard enough even though I had daily bouts of intense nausea from drinking a mouthful of water.  
((I'm heading towards a possible diagnosis of Gastroparesis, which is exciting.))   
Most doctors i've seen haven't had a clue and assumed I wanted to get out of school.

  
My partner has Chronic Fatigue, possibly genetic from his mother. She did not have an easy time. Her brothers still consider her just lazy.  
The problem with the idea of laziness is that it ignores the fact that there are always reasons for things. Not doing something or not acting in an expected, healthy way ALWAYS has a reason behind it, even if that reason is simply disinterest, which is what is often assumed of ""lazy"" people.  
But is disinterest always such a bad thing? I could be writing a paper on Steam Engines right now, but I am simply not interested in doing so. Am I lazy for that?  
If disinterest is the cause of not doing something important then that is not laziness either. You are harming yourself. That is a sign of mental illness.  


The reason I didn't do my homework and struggled to find energy was because I was sick. Every time I ate or drank I would feel nauseous for hours, so I avoided food and drink till the afternoon where I could spend most my time in the bathroom or in bed.  
Maybe people assumed I didn't apply myself to working because I was lazy, because I was disinterested in my future.  
Even if that were true - if ""they don't care about their future"" made them think poorly of me rather than making them think ""are they ok? is their home life ok? are they coping with life?"" makes them look *pretty bad.*",,,12,0,0,

I'm a transgender man, and having to deal with dysphoria daily and feeling as though, manly as I may feel, other people don't and won't ever see me as being manly, sucks to begin with. Add being in a wheelchair most of the time, needing to be handled very gently, having mental illnesses on top of the physical ones, being unable to gain and maintain weight so I constantly look tiny, and being unable to do serious power lifting and other real muscle toning workouts to better help with these things is the actual worst. I'm constantly treated like a dainty little flower when I see myself as a strong and capable man, and having not only my outward appearance not match this, but my physical and mental disabilities making it worse is a struggle every day.

I think the best way I've found to deal with it is not only positive affirmations to yourself, sometimes even daily, but also surrounding yourself with the right kind of people. Don't involve yourself with anyone who treats you like you are less capable than you are, or infantilises you in any way. Make friends with those who jump in to help or do something for you when you ask, not those who offer to help or do something for you when you don't need or want them to. And don't be afraid to talk to your guy friends about this - if they aren't mature enough to listen and take your feelings about your struggles with disability seriously, or god forbid make fun of you, they aren't worth getting to even know what a great and manly as hell dude you are.

e038a184-d3ea-496f-9f65-20567dafebfe,1571777542,"Instinctively I was with you that the context was everything but on reflection, no. I'll start with the giant disclaimer that although I developed my disability as a child, I don't like using a wheelchair and if you offered me a miracle fix tomorrow I'd bite your hand off. People who actively like their disability and would choose to keep it will have a very different opinion. 

It's a cute video of a kid learning a new skill. In r/aww I first thought urgh, people awwing at a person with CP doing something basic, it's the man in McD's with help to eat all over again. But...if that had been an able bodied kid, I'd still have awwed. I didn't awww because of his frame, overcoming adversity or whatever trollop. I aww'd because it was a kid with an adorable goofy smile, straight down to the two grown up teeth, learning something new and getting joy out of it. 

If an able bodied kid had been posted on a bike without stabilisers with mum holding onto the back going 'whoooooooah!' while someone videoed I'd have awwed. This has more upvotes than a kid on a bike because it's novel. People are attracted to new things, most adults have learned to ride a bike but very few will have learned to skateboard in a giant metal frame. 

I also don't think that disability porn is inherently bad, though that depends on how you define it. Here it's a video clearly taken by someone who knew mom &amp; kid and presumably initially uploaded with their consent. OP, even if they're not the original uploader, is introducing people to a new concept (I would never have thought of a skateboard frame!) and includes the name of the company, which can help other people in the same position. 

I find it inspirational because mum knew their kid wanted to skateboard and went to find a way to make that happen. So many parents wouldn't. A kid's life isn't going to be ruined because they can't skateboard, it's not a necessity. But it can add a lot for someone to have an experience they never thought would happen, particularly in kids where peer pressure is so intense. I wish I'd had the same support as a child. I find it inspirational on the part of the kid because doing something new is fun but terrifying. I've sat at the edge of a big hill going 'fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck' with someone egging me on to do what I'm scared of and went over the edge shitting myself the whole way down. I was so proud and had the same goofy smile. 

Everyone has different opinions on this. I don't mind people calling me inspirational for something I've worked hard at. It *is* harder to do a lot of things with a disability. You *do* have to work harder. I find it nice to have that hard work and achievement recognised. Yes, it would be better if I didn't have to work so hard in the first place, I'll support and fight for anything that makes that easier but it's not likely to happen in my lifetime. Lots of my problems are from basic geography or issues with cost which are so hard to change. What I consider disability porn is someone applauding me for everyday tasks that are not inspirational **for me.**

I commented on a post earlier from someone who cleaned their fridge freezer. That's a huge step for them as an individual and it should be applauded. They did fucking great doing a task that was difficult for them and is a huge step in managing their life. As a stranger on the internet I'm damn proud of them, completing a task that is hell for you is inspirational. For me now, cleaning the fridge is no big deal. If someone congratulated me for it I'd call them a condescending cunt. But there absolutely was a time when I was just as excited and proud to clean the fridge because it was a huge deal for me *at that time*. I would have looked up to that poster as somewhere I wanted to be, just as a brand new able bodied runner might look up to a marathon competitor. So while I'm not in that place any more, I know how difficult it is and I still find every person that manages a task that is difficult for them an inspiration. This kid is on a skateboard which I bet they looked at and may have dreamed of but never thought would happen. And yet here they are. 

Someone whose artistic limit is a stick man is going to be inspired by someone who has just learned anatomically correct line drawings, who may be inspired by someone who adds colour after a class last week, and then can shade to show three dimensions, and then to draw hyperrealistic art or whatever your own progression is. Someone with CP who can't stand may be inspired by someone who can, who'll be inspired by someone who runs etc. Sometimes the inspiration only comes if the person running couldn't stand at some point. For others it's enough for someone to have the same disability in name no matter what function they had to begin with. The goal posts for achievement from an individual standpoint are different for everyone and they constantly move. 

People who have never had a disability don't have the same reference to draw from as people who have, unless they are very close to someone who does. I find a lot that people who have never used a wheelchair are inspired at the daily tasks I do just because they don't have any experience to draw from. Society has told them that people in wheelchairs are all the same and have zero skills. ***That*** is the problem. They can't imagine not standing up because that's just what they do and all they know. This is getting better, so many more people are aware of disability realities and accommodations than they were twenty years ago and the internet has a huge hand in that. 

Every disability is different and everyone's capability is different, even between two people with the same grade of illness or injury and between stages of illness and injury. Able bodied people tend to progress in a straight line. People with a disability stop and start and go backwards and sideways and upwards and downwards. I think being inspired by an individual's progress is fine, being inspired because you assume someone's capabilities is not. If you put someone with a different disability in my position the progress would be different. I'm in a sports club where I'm the only wheelchair user. Initially they were inspired by everything I did, because they had no baseline to draw from. Now that I've been there a while my baseline is ignored but I'm congratulated for doing things that are actually impressive - for me. They're still nothing for an able bodied person. I'm still much, much slower. I will always take longer to learn things and sometimes I will go backwards. There are many things I flat out won't ever be able to do. Occasionally I find something I'm better at than the average able bodied person! But no matter what I get a warm fuzzy feeling when they tell me I'm inspirational for learning something when I worked my arse off to get there. If they waited for me to be impressive by able bodied milestones, I would nearly always fall short and end up feeling a failure, I'm glad they're inspired by different things. It takes me so much longer but I stick at it where many able bodied people would give up because it's too hard. That's not inspirational to me, it's a fact of life that I need to survive but when I think about it it was a skill I had to build, having a disability in a world not built for you means you have to stick at things more than the average. Able bodied people find that determination inspiring, because it's not their norm. It's understandable and I'm okay with it, those people work to help me reach the baseline and are pleased when I reach it. It's like the difference between laughing with someone and at them. 

Context is important but context is difficult. Imagine telling a stranger 'I stood up today'. For me, that would be a major achievement. For a complete SCI it's a damn miracle. For an able bodied person they do it many times a day. Above I swapped an able bodied equivalent in but you can't always do that. For all we know the kid in this gif couldn't walk a year ago and standing would have been a big thing for them. Now skateboarding is a big thing. In the future there may be another big thing. All we can do is assume and compare to our own experiences, which is rarely going to be accurate.",,,2,0,0,

Over here you can apply for a ""Blue Badge"" which is a disabled parking permit which can also be used to get a free bus pass for all local bus services (but not national coaches). Most sellers of disability aids will sell most of their items to you VAT free if you have a valid blue badge. It's essentially proof that you don't have to pay VAT on these items, which includes mobility scooters and wheelchairs.  


Our disability specific welfare payments are under a system called PIP (Personal Independence Payments, replacing the old DLA Disability Living Allowance) which pays on 2 rates for 2 factors. One is daily living, the other is mobility. If you're on standard or higher rate for mobility, then you can go on the government scheme for mobility scooters/electric wheelchairs (and even mobility adapted cars) in which they will take an amount out of what they pay you for that rate and provide the mobility equipment which includes annual service, breakdown recovery, and a new one every 2-3 years. It works out a lot more expensive though which is why I bought mine outright when I got a back payment of welfare (they assessed me incorrectly and I appealed, but that process took over a year - another big issue wth the system as 90%+ of appeals succeed which tells you something about the assessments and how much they outright lie to keep you from getting money).


Anyway I don't know if mobility equipment sellers are told to prevent people without a genuine need from buying (ie, making a general evaluation of the customer's attitudes when they come in to buy if they don't have a blue badge or similar), but I don't think many people bought them as a way to be lazy. I'm actually looking at getting my husband a little electric standing scooter, one with a bicycle seat, so he can keep up with me on my mobility scooter which could be fun for him and also help him not be so exhausted as he has to care for me too. But he wouldn't use my scooter for that, even though I have a second one (it's old and needs new batteries and a service, I'm hoping to sell it cheap to a friend who needs it). I mean option B is I get him a skateboard and tell him to hang on to the back of the chair...

So, I stopped reacting with nerves about my chair - and other people followed suit. Those who didn't simply stopped interacting with me, which took a lot of awkwardness out of my life.

If you can get the AFO into your normal aesthetic as well, it'll help a lot with self acceptance :) after a while, at least for me, I stopped paying any mind to my wheelchair (or sometimes crutches) in terms of what other people thought, or indeed at all - its a tool that helps me, and dammit not many people get to wear AFOs or cut about in wheelchairs, or use crutches; its a novel and interesting experience, so making it look good is just fun and an interesting challenege to your look, as well as a statement on you prioritising your safety and comfort.",,,2,0,0,

Needing and accepting help can both be very difficult, especially if you were independent up until your medical state went downhill (like mine did). I spent a lot of time haranguing myself for not being tough enough to continue to push through the pain any more. I felt like shit for no longer being able to make a living. The transition to being disabled is often accompanied by financial stress, social isolation and depression (speaking both from personal experience and former career in the mental health services field).

Despite your statement that you don't expect or want sympathy, I'm giving you mine. Many, if not most of the people on this forum have been in your shoes, so to speak. So take the sympathy from those who aren't being in the least patronizing.

I finally came to accept (most of the time) the fact that I didn't ask the universe to gut-punch me. You didn't ask to be assaulted. Regardless of the reason you were hospitalized, you didn't ask for the infection. Shit just happens.

People react differently to trauma. Don't compare your coping mechanisms to those of others. In gradual school (what my cohort called it), I had a CBT professor who called it ""shoulding all over yourself."" I should have reacted this way. I should have been able to cope more easily. I should have been able to push through physical/emotional/spiritual pain. My life shouldn't be like this. I should have been super-human.

A few things that I keep in mind and use as touchstones on my bad days:

1. You didn't ask for this (even if you somehow, in some way, believe that you contributed to your condition, as you state.) Give yourself a break. You didn't ask for the infection.

2. Don't project your bad day(s) into an  indefinite future. I know it's cliche, but try to take one day at a time, or one hour, or 15 minutes.

3. You have survived all of your bad days.

4. Try to catch your inner monologue spiraling downward, in a negative loop. This can be very difficult, because we live our lives inside our heads, and aren't objective. One (simple and somewhat simplistic) strategy I used to recommend is to set a timer for, say, every hour (or whatever works for you) and assess your inner monologue/private speech. If it's not in a good place, physically do something (for example, clapping your hands and saying ""No!"" forcefully, either out loud or privately, to yourself). You might picture a stop sign, in as clear and complete a mental image as possible. Concentrate on it hard for 60 seconds. Rinse and repeat as needed.

5. Find a counselor that is right for you. Every counselor is different. Try to find one who specializes in working with people who have long-term disabilities, such as chronic pain, or something like your situation.

6. Ignore people in your life who aren't supportive of your new/changed reality. You know you best. Your plate is already full. In other words: F*** 'em.

This community can also be a support. We won't think you are weak, attention-seeking, a whiner, or that you deserve what happened.

Please note that all of the above is speculative, and should not be used as a substitute for in-person counseling. It is based on the limited information you provided. We haven't met, discussed your desires, goals, supports, obstacles, etc. These are just generic tips to try until you find a good counselor.

PM me if you need to talk. I'm not (much) of a creep.

Be well and be good to yourself.

On an unnecessary side note: (Regardless of anyone's political leanings, I can't stand it that Melania Trump hijacked my ""Be better"" statement. It's ruined now because of the political baggage attached.)",,,3,0,0,

As it stands people with BIID have a mental illness that causes them to inflict physical disfigurement. They are no less disabled than someone with depression or a personality disorder or ADHD...or autism. Mental illnesses are still disabilities. 

I would struggle to sit across from someone with BIID who had ruined a healthy body I never got the chance to experience.

This one is if you are disabled and it determines that you cant continue to work they will pay a set amount (based on previous employment income over your lifetime). To qualify you need so many working credits, basically if you have been working a part time miniuimum wage job for 2/3 of the time from 16-current age you quilify for this.

SSI = social security income
Same as above except you do not need the working credits.

----------------
Now in terms what you get from each program

SSI &lt; SSDI : SSDI will always pay more


SSI has household income limits, and assets limits. Meaning if your the things you own or have are worth any decent amount you have to spend it before SSI will kick in.

SSDI doesnt care about your assets or household income. It only cares about your EARNED income. Note: earned is a key word, money made from stocks is not earned income, money made a w2 or 1099 is earned income.",,,2,0,0,

Only after threatening to call the cops did the timeshare manager make the girls come back and let me in the room.

Wow, that is bollocks. I'd ask them what their suggestions are to manage this, if a professor is going to get around accommodations on a technicality the accommodations either need to state a limit of missed classes or specifiy unlimited absences. Not much help at the moment but for the future. I'd also make sure and do this before the semester officially starts so you can make sure the profs running your classes will conform to your accommodations.  

Some professors are awkward for the sake of being awkward (how dare you miss my class!) while others are genuinely concerned that missing classes mean you won't have an understanding of the material. This is especially applicable to profs who give a good lecture that branches out vs those who read the same powerpoint slides they wrote ten years ago. You can learn a lot from a good, experienced lecturer that isn't always going to be in a textbook and may be drawn on in an exam. Could you suggest to the disability office that your lectures are recorded? I got a spare recorder and gave it to a classmate who recorded lectures when I was in hospital. This may also satisfy the more stubborn 'my lectures are the best' prof though they are generally much harder to deal with and if you know a particular prof has that attitude I'd avoid taking their classes wherever possible. I'd also try and keep communication through email or other written method, it keeps track and makes it easier to escalate if there's a problem. 

What is it specifically that causes your absences? There may be an option to help that your disability office hasn't thought of. I found that although mine were happy to help, they didn't know a whole lot about *how* and honestly, neither did I. If I had a problem I'd look into it and see how other people had solved it, go to them and say 'hi, if you could do x and y it would help me attend/keep up with work because z reason' they'd do their best to put it in place or find a similar alternative.

There is a five month waiting period so if you were found disabled as of the date of your application you would have to wait five months and would not get your first check until January because the SSA pays one month in arrears. If you also get approved for SSI there is a waiting period for that.

Here's my advice as someone who's been through the process:


1) Apply by (e)mail. You should be able to download a copy of the application form and fill it in on your PC. You can then send off the completed form. I've never had a phone interview and I've got PIP, so you don't need to worry about phone calls.

2) Check your score. You can find lists online of the PIP criteria and if you're truthful about how your daily life is affected, you can get an idea of whether you qualify for PIP. If you think you deserve 8 or more points in either category, then apply for PIP.

3) Go to CAD. Find a local Citizens Advice and go along for a face to face appointment asking for help filling in your application. Most CAB have experts who can give you an idea of what to say for each question on the application form.

4) Persevere. You'll almost certainly be turned down the first time, so you have to request a reconsideration, and you'll probably be turned down again. So you'll have to go to a tribunal, where you'll probably win your PIP claim at last.

5) Don't stress about diagnosis. With PIP it doesn't really matter what your disabilities are; what's important is how your daily life is affected. Focus on your daily struggles and let the DWP know what you have problems with, without having to explain what the causes are.

6) Use the CAB as much as possible. Really, they can be invaluable in getting you through the process.

7) PM me if you want/need to chat.",,,1,0,0,

I think people go ""well family should help"" and then family goes ""well the government should help"" and that's that.  Subsidized housing exists in theory but in practice is years long wait lists that involve you agreeing to move hours away from any support you may have to a shitty place or getting booted of the list. People think we are getting by easy because they compare themselves ""having"" to work and are resentful of complaints about the amounts paid out. It pisses me off because I don't think anyone expects disability assistance to give them a grand life just not to be a total lie, as in if you are hanging out money to rent housing it should be possible to live SOMEWHERE other than your imagination and the street based on that amount. People are homeless because that's the only way they can afford to eat and people are stuck in abusive situations etc because it's the only way they can have shelter unless they are very lucky and have someone that cares that much.

The alternative to an elevator in my case would be to have a separate wheelchair on each floor of my home and to use a chair lift to move between floors. That is a very expensive option due to the high cost of wheelchairs and the risks associates with transferring (such as falls).

948f5be7-0b73-435b-950f-7397edd9b15b,1571404023,"It took awhile to be honest.  I was 35 when I became disabled, so I had to unlearn a life of able bodied habits and preconceptions.  The big stuff I more or less expected, but little things I hadn't thought about would catch me off guard and leave me in frustrated tears.  I knew I would have trouble getting in and out of a tub.  I hadnt thought that I would automatically try to swing a leg that didnt exist anymore to do it, throwing myself out of balance and ending up on the floor.   I had a lot of moments where I would emotionally break down and throw days long pity parties.  When I was abled, I was considered strong in both appearance and ability.  It was a hell of a thing to lose that.  


  I ended up mostly shedding off caring what others saw in me.  I knew they would always see the disability before the person, so I could safely disregard worrying about it.  I still care how people very close to me see me, and thats about it.  Those are folks who I love and who see me person first.  Letting go of the rest allowed me to start really thinking about what I truly cared about in terms of my life.  I knew I still wanted to be strong; not for others, but for myself (and my daughter of course).  I knew I wanted to be helpful to society in a real way.  I knew I wanted to have as many happy moments as I could get.  


  I started by thinking of problems I would have to face in this new body, putting myself in those situations in safe areas, then practicing how to get myself out of them.  I learned how to master what ability I had left beyond what rehab taught me.  I highly advise you do the same.   It gives you a goal to work towards that you work hard for and feel a lot of pride about.  You can learn to do more than you might think.  You cant get the old ability back, but its not about that; its about showing yourself that you can live with the ability you have.  When you see that you can still push and strive, it does wonders for your mental state.  Dont be afraid to face a little pain and sweat. 

&amp;#x200B;

  I'm 5 years into this disabled life and I'm still learning things.  I still have moments of hurt and emotional weakness.  I probably always will, but thats ok because I've learned to accept my body and disability too.  It took time and hard work, but it was very worth it.  You can get there too.  If you still need time to come to terms, take it.  If you feel like its time to start pushing again though, I say get to it.  Show yourself how much fire you still have within!",,,1,0,0,

The benefits I'm entitled to actually equal the salary I was on prior to my illness, but the claiming process is so gruelling and as there is a policy of denying claims until appealed (at which point 73% of decisions are overturned!) it means trying to survive on very little, taking out loans to cover bills, relying on friends and family for help. My family live abroad so I'm a bit stuck. 

I hope your situation improves, wish I could offer useful advice but as our welfare systems are so different I'm not sure what I can say. Are there any disability advocacy groups that you can contact to provide support and advice for your situation?",,,1,0,0,

Although I very much like the show and root for Henry, I actually think it handles disability in some pretty terrible ways, TBH. I don't know about the prosthetic, so I guess I haven't gotten that far yet. 

I get that the reason Clay is despicable is his behavior immediately prior to becoming disabled, but so much of other characters' dialogue about him after becoming so was very hard to take, even though his actions are partly what put him in the chair. Henry's sincere joy at his condition and her whole speech about it... yeah, I get it, but still, a little cringey. 

Later in the finale after he is at her house the other characters make him invisible and talk about him as though he is not there. 

Granted, I haven't seen him at all in season 2 yet except for his short interview with the acting sheriff, maybe things change later. 

I guess the show makes me uncomfortable because Clay did something horrible that led to his accident, yet his treatment after becoming disabled is.... hard to take. For me, anyway.

From what I've read, if you were suicidal, and you certainly have proof for that, it might accelerate your application. You have a work history, and proof that you can't work. There is a minimum amount of work history you need in order to apply. I don't know offhand what that is. Normally you also need an extensive medical history, but the medical history you do have (admission for suicidal thoughts) should suffice. I think you should:

1. Complete an application. If you can get to a SS office, they can, and will, assist you.

2. Get all the aid you can from state assistance. SNAP, housing, Medicaid, more.

3. Wait. You can call your state disability office and SS in your area to check progress on your claim. Sometimes that helps move things along. Do it once a week. It will NOT hurt your claim, but help it.

4. If you aren't getting answers from the above, call your US Senator's or US Rep's Constituents Services Office. They will follow up with SS and, if necessary, your state disability office.

Good luck!

The best thing I did was get a psychiatrist to advocate that it was not a mental illness (in your case maybe it is and that’s the help you need either way a good first step and easy if you’re on campus) and quantify what I was experiencing for example: 
3hrs a day of excessive fatigue
Walk 1.2 miles before collapse
One to one awake to sleep ratio needed (this one got me the most attention but I didn’t just spout this number I kept a journal of how much I was sleeping and found that if I got less than 7hrs a night I couldn’t even digest food) 

Avoid saying things like “I can’t get out of bed” unless that’s really all it is. If you can’t get out of bed because of pain highlight that. If your muscles are not responding to your brain be very specific that you are experiencing paralysis. If you feel tired and heavy but maybe if you really really tried and used all of your energy you could stand up say that. But, that phrase in particular is how they train doctors to recognize depression so that’s the path they will want to pursue. So, really know to describe your symptoms. 

I presented this to a campus doctor and specifically asked for a full rheumatological panel. That came back with a positive ANA test and from there I saw a rheum. She also ordered other tests. But nobody would listen til I quantified just how much it affected my life.

On the hair colour, this month left is blue (dark roots lighter ends) and right purple. I have been dyeing it for so long the colour fades but doesn’t disappear anymore. I use Directions hair dye and have been using that for mmmm 25-ish years now. Went back to a normal colour twice but my SO said it just doesn’t look like me if my hair is black or brown.

About my chair I have motor assisted wheels, because my strength and stability of the joints is bad. My city counsel will provide you with one mobility aid and I had to choose between a scooter or a wheelchair. I picked the chair because I can’t use the scooter indoors. Last year I crowdfunded a electric “hand”bike that attaches to my chair. It was hard but I got about 50% funded by friends and family. We had been saving up for a few years and but they are so expensive without my friends help it would have taken me another 3 years.

The hand bike is amazing, I live in a country we’re everybody rides bikes everywhere so for me it is a workable situation and it has given me so much more freedom.

Ow almost forgot, I held on to them for the longest time but I got rid of my 50ies dresses and petticoats it just doesn’t work for me in a chair. The only dresses and skirts I can wear have to be a bit tighter so not to get caught in my wheels. And I can’t wear tight stuff it irritates me so, no skirts for me :(",,,2,0,0,

But for me it has been a life changer, no more asking for rides I can come and go as I please, I love it.
Having said that The Netherlands (where I am at) is a serious bike riding country we have bike lanes everywhere and cars are used to sharing the road with bikes. So I feel relatively save, it is an issue that cars “over look” me sometimes so I have to stay alert but the roads here are build with bikes in mind so that helps A LOT.

My bike had a “top” speed of 12,6 km/h (they said it was 15 but they lied) which is just way too slow. I mean I got over taken by five year olds, and it was hard for people to ride with me because I was so slow. I knew they capped the speed so a google search and a smart SO found the software that caps the speed and we adjusted it to 22 km/h. I wouldn’t go that fast in town but on the long straight bike lanes outside of town it is great being able to keep up with my friends and family.

As far as the clothes, I feel ya, I used to wear Victorian dresses, bustle and all, corsets and capes (old school Goth) but it doesn’t take a genius to see that that would work anymore, as they were all hand made to fit me they have become useless. The 50-ies dresses were store bought so I donated them to our local shelter. I couldn’t donate the Victorian ones, just to much time and memories so they are on a rack in my attic.

SSDI (Social Security Disability Insurance) is an earned insurance type benefit for adults who had earned sufficient work credits and then become unable to work, and must fold for SSDI within (usually) 5 years of Last Day Worked. There are no limits on household assets or other household income. 

SSI is for adults who do not have a work history, or insufficient work history, or lack of recent work history IR disabled children. In addition to being found disabled by SSA you must also meet very strict HOUSEHOLD income and asset limitations.

Its definitely rough but it isn't the end of the world. Agreed with the other poster that it might go away with time since your source isn't a genetic variant. In the meantime I would reccomend carrying a cane if you don't already. It helps a lot with the gait problems and I've used the cane in the past to trick my brain into righting itself when the balance starts up. 

Ataxia does make getting around more difficult but it doesn't make it impossible. Fun fact: I qualified for the Boston Marathon as a mobility impaired runner thanks to the ataxia. It was one of the strangest feelings, because yeah I'm into Boston, is one of the happiest moments of most marathoners careers. But also it meant acknowledging that I'm now at a point where my problems affect my ability to run. This wasn't as much the case a year ago. 

Learning to work around a chronic problem isn't fun and it does get in the way some days but it doesn't mean it might be the end of the world. Even if it doesn't go away you should still be able to walk by the sounds of it you just might need the use of a mobility aid.",,,2,0,0,

Man 'O War was handicapped with more weight than any horse ever carried and still won all but one of his races. ""Disabled"" translates as ""unable"" and that's wrong in so many ways. You can still have a strong work ethic - it's just different than it used to be. 

What can you do that still gives you satisfaction? Can you turn it into something profitable? A lot of handicapped people create art and crafts of some type. I knew a blind furniture maker. He created simple, well-made tables and cabinets. You write well, perhaps that could lead to something that gives you a feeling of accomplishment.

You could think of yourself as ""temporarily inconvenienced"" rather than disabled if you absolutely must have a label. It really helps to develop a sense of humor about it. A good sense of the absurd will go a long way toward helping you live with it.

I have Parkinson's. When my medication is dialed in, and I am moving fine I am good to go. When my medication wears off it is like my body turns into a cement statue. It is very hard to move.

So I go running 3 miles. Heart rate is at a nice 140 bpm at easy pace (14 minutes/mile). Medication wears off dystonia kicks in and I am struggling to keep moving. Heart rate has hit 220 bpm (not good) and I am moving slower! It is pretty clear something is wrong, but I keep moving.

So I have that catch-22 of a Handicap Parking plate. Run into Costco, and I'm doing great. Smiling, happy, and cruising along. Within 10 minutes I am stiff and barely able to walk. Crap this sucks. I use the shopping cart to keep my balance, but need to wait for someone to walk pass to take the cart back. During hotter months I don't take my Service Dog with me (by the time they open at 10 AM it is way too hot for her to be on the parking lot).

A woman who was born without the use of her legs came to my university to do a talk that was basically her just patting herself on the back for being so successful. And she used her success to tell the group that being disabled doesn’t make people difference, it doesn’t mean we have harder lives, and that society should stop acting like it’s a big accomplishment for a disabled person to “get out of bed in the morning “.  I have a close friend with bipolar, fibromyalgia, PTSD and a currently undiagnosed GI issue.

On one hand disabled people are directly effected because they are dieing slow and painful deaths where they deserve the right to dignified and as painless as possible death. On the other hand you're right that this could encourage medical providers to see the disabled as simply a burden who should just die. I think the fairest way its been implemented is that the patient has to be terminal (with an expect death with in a ceritan amount of time, usually a few months) and be cleared by a psychologist to do it.

Edit: I didn't even think of the way it could shape medical providers views on the disabled until you brought this up, and it is extremely important to consider.

Edit 2: I think it kind of is the same conversation as sterilization in a lot of ways. People deserve the right to be sterilized if they want to be. No one should ever be forced to have a child. Period. But we have to allow sterilization without it becoming something that people who carry known genetic disorders are pressured into because society believes they should not reproduce. And that pressure isn't always going to be directly telling a patient they should be sterilized it can be over hyping the possible complaications, or just in something as simple as the demeanor of the doctor, or them saying how hard it will be to get insurance for that kid, or find specialist, or them trying to convince the patient it'll be far to expensive to have a disabled child. There's so many subtle ways a doctor could influence a patient due to their personal beliefs it's impossible to police. But If you don't want to have kids and pass on your disorder that should be your right but if you still want to have kids knowing you may pass on your disorder that should still also be your right. It's very hard to find the safe balance between the two. And so the same goes with AS people should have the right to a humane and dignified death but if someone wants every second they can get from life they should have the right to that and the best medical care available up to their natural death.",,,2,0,0,

I was too fucked off to get my law degree which was my life’s aspiration my great regret.).     
    
I’m just reaching out as I feel we have similar trajectories and I wanted to congratulate you on your clean time despite being in perhaps the most compromising situation a person in recovery could face.   
  
I don’t want to be corny but wow. You might be fucking frustrated and pissed off at yourself but to me... I just see a huge inspiration. Thank you for sharing your story.  
    
No one said we have to be a pillar of innocence or even a good person to have a disability , but you clearly ARE and I can see that just by your thoughtfulness and the work you did in your career.  
  
Have you found your place in a program of recovery (or multiple programs maybe)? 
  
I needed to be involved in service to my community to stop to keep the self hate and massive depression at bay. Programs of recovery offer opportunities for service work in many forms. Just showing up, for example, is service work. There are people who need to hear your story and see you in active recovery so they know they can do it, too.   
 I don’t know what will work for you but I can tell you what I did and how it worked or didn’t.   
  
I am in 12 step programs (AA, NA, AlAnon) and a variety of other recovery communities to meet my needs. I was extremely resistant to 12 step because of the “god” stuff and the stigma of it all but have the ability to take what works and leave the rest , this program is expansive , highly accessible, and I hate to say it but there is some magic to the community aspect of it. I think you would benefit from it.  
Personally I had to seek out several different recovery programs to meet all my needs (CBT based programs )- I’m in the 12 step but I also do some real research-based recovery because I I’m just oppositional like that and I need to be reassured with data that I’m not involved in some woo woo bullshit.  
 I need to do these things because I can stay clean alone but I am a miserable fuck.  
  
I need to be invoked in disability advocacy or I’m miserable. I need to be EnGage in active recovery or I’m miserable. I need to do service work, I need to help someone else, take my tablets, feel independent, and stay on my ketogenic diet.   
  
Once you start to get more well over time... advocacy organizations NEED lawyers and you are a huge asset.   
  
You ARE powerful.   
I don’t care how corny it sounds.  
  
The disability advocacy community needs you. 
The recovery community needs you, too.  
  
Maybe consider showing up for these communities because you might find you need them as much as they need you.   
  
  
Much love and DM me anytime.

ba64adf1-521f-4ea7-8d17-4b0c757d8ad1,1569969819,"The worst memory I have of this was probably my freshman year of college. I was in premed biology lecture and struggled to finish exams on time d/t impaired dexterity related to a degenerative neuromuscular disease I was born with. I knew the material, I just couldn't write fast enough and kept running out of time. For the first time, I applied for (and received) extra time as appropriate accommodation via the Accessibility Services office.

I went from being a C student to being the top scoring student in the very competitive section of 100+ students, at a top ranked East Coast liberal arts school full of future doctors.

The professor pulled me aside and remarked on my dramatic improvement, and asked me directly why I was receiving extra time. It was clear he thought I was faking some sort of problem and shouldn't have the accommodation, he essentially accused me of cheating. To him, a student who needs reasonable accommodation and a student who is the best in class couldn't be the same person. 

I stuttered something vague and ran out of his office, and eventually became a humanities major. Now I'm a successful medical professional, so I guess the joke is on him, but the whole thing was fucking awful.

I knew my illness is real, and the accommodation was appropriate, but the sense of shame is vivid in my memory to this day, over a decade later. I still struggle to ask for help, even when I know I need it, and I am not out to most of my colleagues at the hospital about my illness. It doesn't seem worth the risk.",,,22,0,0,

*I have had chronic eczema and have had sores. One thing that worked great - Head and Shoulders shampoo - with tea tree oil. I use it just like body wash. Tea tree oil helps by being antibacterial. The zinc in the shampoo helps with the eczema. 

*After the head and shoulders, use shea butter. The fats in it will assist in moisturizing. 

*You can find shea butter VERY cheap if you look into African American hair products. I bought a huge container for $5 - you want the pure stuff and it does not have to be name brand. Just 100% shea butter. It's cheaper than coconut and actually better for your skin. 

*I am not sure where you have sores/eczema - I get it on my hands. Wear gloves when you can. Even the ones you sleep in. You will find relief with these tips.

 In my good, incredible relationship, she developed a brain tumor and became erratic and unpredictable. It took years to figure out what happened and when. Then she died of lung cancers. I got very little time to say goodbye, as she only became herself a week or two before she died. 

The military gaslighted me as did the VA. It literally took 9/11 and a Congressman to get my records unsealed enough to be given disability. After waiting years. 

I spent 20+ years doubting my own perceptions and feelings around the military, despite a few walk on water evaluations, a senior position as a junior enlisted person, and one hell of a job responsibility. This was a job where we had to never discuss any of it beyond what the evaluations said when off site.

 This led to me compartmentalizing my feelings. The VA has said the whole lot of us who did this sort of job can't be treated because  the VA is only set up for combat veterans. The admitting inpatient clinician said he hoped I didn't kill myself and that I had a good life. That's pretty rough to hear at discharge from hospital.

I also prided myself on my independence.  I've lost the first entirely and the second is a constant struggle to maintain what I have left.  I completely understand how you feel.

  What sucks is that I can't tell you it gets any easier.  Disabled life is hard.  Becoming disabled after spending decades in an able body is also one hell of a head trip, and not the fun kind.  There are so many abled perceptions that shatter upon becoming disabled;  So many actions you never thought about now become something you need to relearn, etc.  Being disabled is a son of a bitch to say the least.

  You know that though!  It's not a surprise anymore.  You're not getting sucker punched by that fact anymore.  This gives you a choice, and it's a choice you make over and over.  You choose how to face it.  You know it's not stopping, but you don't have to either!  

  I wallowed in depression for about a year before I started trying to truly live again.  The first thing I had to to was dump all my preconceived notions of what success in life was.  You should work on the same.

Needing help is nothing to be ashamed of as long as you earnestly try to be worthy of that help.  Being worthy is as simple as being a family member or friend who does what they are able to for those they love.  Hell, just offering an ear can mean the world to the people.

  Finding something work like you can do helps a bunch.  I like to volunteer whenever my pain allows, and I have a couple hobbies that double as extra income sometimes.  Take stock of what ability you reliably have and find things to do that fit withing that ability.  It might not be the dream, but it is life happening again.

ac4b06a3-70b2-46db-bb79-648b787d8042,1571150629,"Of course not. But as a disabled person who both works in a museum and does consulting for museums looking to improve their accessibility, I can tell you they *are* doing it. Not as good as they could be, not as much as they should be, and not all of them. But ""museums don't care about accessibility"" is a generalization with no basis in fact. It comes up on the AAM forums all the time. There are Facebook groups where we talk about it. Many museums have an individual - or even a whole department - whose job focuses on accessibility. The LEAD conference, held annually at the Kennedy Center in DC, is an entire conference about accessibility in the field of cultural heritage and the arts. Art Beyond Sight runs the Museum Education Institute.

I will admit that cold-calling museums to sell a product almost never works. Cuseum does this to me all the time, no matter how often I try to get off their list. They want me to use their latest app or whatever. But I don't need that product at that time. A better approach would be to contact me and ask if I would like to learn more about a specific technology, without trying to sell me anything. Make the museum see the need for the *function*, not your particular software. Like I said, lots of companies are doing iBeacons for accessibility in museums. Don't sell your software - sell the benefit it gives to the disabled visitors. Acknowledge that there are competitors in the space - IF I ever need a tour app, I will probably go with Antenna rather than Cuseum, but Cuseum might be able to persuade me otherwise. But first somebody has to convince me that a tour app is something my museum needs. Right now it doesn't make sense for us. (Also our budget doesn't allow it but I'm looking for grants.)

Accessibility is a necessity, not a luxury. Make them see *that* before you ever try to convince them to buy anything. There are museums out there doing a good job at access.

342263b6-c253-4914-b3fb-7e56e2201a2f,1570228009,"Oh man yeah I had to really learn how to dress differently and vastly adjust my wardrobe.  I'm a huge fan of maternity clothes, especially jeans and tights. Firstly they help cover the gap I get when bottoms ride down and tops ride up, and secondly they're gently on my abdomen (I can easily get stomach ache and IBS pain if something is tight or pressing on my lower abdomen). They're just so comfy! I mean I'll be honest I've put on a lot of weight because of meds and not being able to exercise. My diet isn't the best either as we are on a tight budget but yeah maternity clothes allow for that. 


I still wear some dresses but they have to be slightly too big for me usually. I like tops that are close fitting on the chest then flare out over the tummy. I buy jeans 2 sizes bigger so they don't dig in when sat down or cause too many tummy rolls... 


My wedding dress had a Corset top part with a long skirt. My mum adapted the pattern and made it specially for me. It had long cape sleeves, so she made fastenings so when I was sat they would hook up behind me and not be an issue with wheels (for my wedding day I managed to walk down the aisle with help, and a slow awkward first dance, and even a minute on the bouncy castle for a couple of photos, absolutely dead the day after but it was worth it). I hired an electric wheelchair for that day rather than be in a manual one, so I could get around easily. We decorated that up too and put a ""just married"" banner on the back.  


With my lazy goth, well 90% of my wardrobe is black, then a splash of red, purple, and a little bit of olive green. So I'm usually in dark clothes, and I have some dark lipsticks I can just throw on to be lazy without doing a full face. I have multiple black velvet tops and dresses... I want to actually make myself a half length cloak this year, I have black faux fur and black velvet to make it which I've had for years and never got around to it...I have some full length cloaks but they've been caught in wheels and ripped. 


My favourite goth piece is a headband with black roses and black horns. I love wearing it and usually get compliments from elderly ladies, which is really sweet. They tend to like seeing ""different"" things, and it makes them smile so that's a win in my book. Plus they talk about that and not the chair/scooter. 


Oh yeah over here I had the option of using a portion of my disability welfare money to get a mobility scooter with free servicing and an upgrade every 2 years, but I don't need a new one every 2 years and it ends up costing so much more. So when I had a backpayment of welfare owed to me I bought one outright new, and it should last a long long time. Had the 1 year service today and everything is good. It has some suspension too so it's much gentler with bumps. I was able to get a manual wheelchair free from the county's wheelchair service - it's like a free long term hire. If I ever reach a point where I no longer need it then it'll go back to them. Same with the crutches from the hospital physiotherapy department, and some home adaptations from the OT.


The  bike thing sounds really interesting, I might have to look that up because if it's feasible to work with my manual chair then I could use it for places the scooter can't fit/go... I've been tempted to look for a second hand electric wheelchair for this reason to be honest. Thinking of maybe saving for one.",,,1,0,0,

I don’t think that a pharmacy refusing to give a second dose of the flu vaccine to a person under 65 with complex medical needs is discrimination. Nor is a law that prohibits them from doing so discriminatory. 

Convenient care clinics (like the Minute Clinics in CVS) or pharmacy based immunization services are intended to provide very basic healthcare services to patients with uncomplicated medical profiles. The healthcare workers who staff these positions do not have the training to provide care to people with complex care needs. 

It is a public good for inexpensive immunizations to be available to as many people as possible with as little inconvenience as possible. In that way, these convenient care immunization programs do serve everyone. One does not need to get a flu shot from CVS to benefit from CVS immunizing the people in their community. 

Arguably,  those with complex medical needs are amongst those who most benefit from convenience  based immunization programs as they are most vulnerable to communicable diseases and benefit the most from herd immunity.",,,1,0,0,

Autism is not an illness. It’s a neurodevelopmental disorder. There is no underlying “disease process” to autism. There is no illness to cure. Finding ways to manage the symptoms of autism is infinitely more realistic than finding a cure. This would allow people with autism to live an easier or more comfortable life. I’m not saying people should suffer. I’m literally saying their lives could be made easier without manipulating them genetically and potentially fucking up something we don’t understand, or setting the stage for people to pick and chose what genes their kids get to have. The autistic phenotype has been in some ways incredibly valuable to society. Because of autism, we have many great thinkers who have shaped the world. 

As for your friend’s kid, a genetic illness is different to autism. A lot of those illnesses rest one one or a few genes. Autism is way more complex than that, and not entirely genetic. These two things are false equivalencies.",,,1,0,0,

I hate ones that have a 2 meter range and someone walks by and the door opens.  Department stores often have those, but you get a blast of outside air every time. 

Something like a 0.5 meter range (18"") is more ideal as the person is close enough to trigger but they have intent in approach the door.

You could have a home/apartment sense bluetooth to do that. Both my watch and my phone pair via blue tooth. So have the door do the same by recognizing either my watch or my phone. So If I forget one, or have a dead battery, the other device still triggers the door. Two dead devices then a push button door lock would be used to unlock/open the door.

7. If you're worried about accidents it's best to be straight forward with the person and put down a pad. There are some kinky people out there that are into that stuff lol.
8. Be honest from the start. Tell your partner what you can and can't feel, what you will/won't try, what you're enjoying at the moment, etc.. Communication is key.

The only advice I have is to keep a written log and build a relationship with someone at the school clinic. My experience has been that pain and fatigue are unfortunately not useful to help with accurate diagnosis, there are just way too many diseases that cause them. That’s why on first visit the dr will just think Advil.

As a temporary measure, don't be afraid to ask about steroids. They aren't good long term, but it is hard to think long term when you can't function in the now. If you are already taking them, then ask about a stronger dose. I also used to keep ziplocks and a kitchen towel with me at all times to improvise an ice pack. They only last for an hour or so, but if you have access to an ice machine at work, it could work for you to get you a bit more use out of your hands. My mother (we both have RA) has had some success with fingerless pressure gloves. A heating pad is also useful in getting some movement in your hands, even if you just wash your hands in warm water.

For home, I really like the oxo pop container for things like pasta, cereal, flour, etc. you just push gently on the top and it pops open -it can be done with a fist or even an elbow. That way you could at least have cereal or pasta for dinner. Oxo actually makes a lot of big grip things for the kitchen/bath that I've found useful. 

I'd like to promise you that it will get better, (and it still totally could) but you will get better at managing it. You will figure out which tasks are the most difficult and what you are willing to put off. I don't want to be Debbie Downer, but a significant percentage of people diagnosed with RA are on disability within 10 years. Be prepared for a long fight, and don't hesitate to tell your doctors when things aren't working. If they are good at what they do, they will make changes to your treatment plan. If they don't respond to you, seek a second (or third) opinion. There are a lot of medications on the market, both old and new, so there are tons of options. I've tried most of them since I was diagnosed 15 years ago, and we still can't find one that makes me functional enough to work. I have carpal tunnel that is entirely caused by the RA swelling. It took me a long time to come to terms with the idea of applying for SSDI, so long that by the time I was mentally ready I had already lost my job. If I had done it a few months earlier, I would have qualified for LTD and I would be making close to my previous salary, instead of the pittance I get on SSDI. So hope for the best, but plan for the worst. 

Most of all, know that you aren't alone. There will still be good days, even if they seem far off now. Sorry for the novel, but I sincerely hope you find something that works for you soon.",,,1,0,0,

Since my previously unknown illnesses, Fibro/Arthrits, got worst last year, as well as mental issues, and I lost my job, everything just tumbled. BUT 5 months later things were looking way up. On the day I graduated w/ a degree that allows me to work from home partially or fully, I was also preapproved for house contingent on full time employment and already had a dream job offer in my dream place. 

I was really proud of myself for finding a way around my disability to continue working after having to give up my previous career and for being almost independent after struggling for so long. But the next day I was involved in some sort of accident that I have no memory of. To shorten it, it left me totally banged up on the right side of my body, displaced tailbone, 10 hrs of memory loss, etc eventually couldnt get out of bed. 

I'm getting better, I can walk with a cane but I'm having to go through Physical Therapy, Chriopractic Therapy, Muscle Therapy, Trauma Therapy and Pain Management every week. It was also in the midst of this that I was diagnosed with arthitis believed to be either rheumatoid or psoriatic, which will sadly eventually wreck my new career due to it being in my hands.

But the worst part? Everyone and I mean even my own family, thought I was exaggerating the pain because its always been there and couldnt understand why I cant just go get a job. I managed before why not now? Or even a part time minimum wage one. I have no less than 6 doctors appointments every week through at least December plus at least one or two check ups with the specialists monitoring my prescription interactions. 

Even with xray proof its still not enough. Im homeless now and broke, had to give my ESA baby to my ex until i can find a place which shattered me. 

BUT even with all that sad stuff, I am going to take my certification test this coming week, get through my therapies, and own this bs because it does not own me.

Just make sure to go through the evidence requirements and go above and beyond to meet them. Make sure you're diagnosed by a specialist because they'll likely use a GP diagnosis to reject you.

I used to work for the state, and during my tenure there I ended up having to use a power chair. I had a lot of files and each drawer of the filing cabinet was labeled because other people put files in and then other people took files out. I needed a second filing cabinet, because I could no longer reach the top drawer at all and reaching down to the bottom drawer made me dizzy. One of my coworkers had two filing cabinets just because he was so messy.

My original request was denied, and so I talked to HR explaining under the ADA this was an extremely reasonable request. Three days later I was informed that there was not one single available filing cabinet in the entire state. Aside from this clearly being a lie, I turned around and said then spend $100 and buy another one. I know they wanted to fire me right then and there, but they also knew they couldn’t. The next morning an additional filing cabinet magically showed up. I backed out of my cubby so that the manager could bring the filing cabinet into my office and she literally threw the cabinet in place, it crashed down so loud several of my coworkers stood up to see what happened. My manager turned around and said there, are you happy now? I just said thank you very much.

Sometimes you just have to stand up for yourself, especially when you know you are in the right.

If the door to your office is not a secured opening, they should be able to easily modify it to make it accessible for you to open on your own. For the bathroom doors perhaps they could add the automatic opener with a button on the wall that you can push.

In most companies you can get fired for having somebody else clock you in and out. It would certainly be easier for them to lower the time clock to a place where you could reach it and your able-bodied coworkers could reach it as well. That one’s a no brainer.",,,2,0,0,

8f4c1b65-ec5d-47ec-9944-6db8fa6ab846,1571688750,"HONEST QUESTION: People can afford these? The price is outrageous... green pepper 75¢, chopped green pepper $2.99, 1lb carrots 89¢, carrot sticks $2.99... 1lb onions 53¢, chopped onion $2.99. Even if you double or triple the amounts before cutting it doesn't add up.  I get that it is a convenience but why not use that money for food choppers/processors?  In a matter of weeks you could save up for a $25 food chopper and in 6 months to a year you could have a really excellent professional style processor. Or call your local High School/Community College and see if they have students interested in food careers that need service hours.

People are free to do what they want, of course. I just don't understand why you would pay so much for so little when there are other options.

Are there places where these prepared foods aren't so outrageously expensive?",,,1,0,0,

The passenger seat probably would've been easier but that door on his car doesn't open fully so it wasn't an option. I have a hatchback Toyota matrix which afterwards I was thinking might be easier.  
He uses a gait belt in physical therapy, so I would imagine he'd be allowed to use one for this. I think I'll have my mom ask his PT about that, because it does seem like it could be easier from some videos I watched.",,,3,0,0,

When it comes to physical therapy ... I had a lot of success just looking up exercises and watching YouTube videos. Don't necessarily wait on doing physical therapy until you have money to pay to go. It's extremely expensive, at least in my area.  

A combination of a heating pad, ice packs and doing the exercises as regularly as I'm able has been beneficial. It's about doing it consistently and taking it easy and slow so you don't hurt yourself. 

The main thing I got from working with a physical therapist was making sure my form was correct. It might be worth saving up to go to one or two visits to get your exercises and form down right, but in my experience, I've gotten far more out of PT just from doing it consistently at home than I ever got out of going to see a physical therapist.

Edit: obviously your specific issues play a lot into it, so your situation could be completely different from mine",,,1,0,0,
