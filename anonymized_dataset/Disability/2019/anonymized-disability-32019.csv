c4c3838e-cd0d-46de-9a04-9efb177cf93d,1552359009,"See I’m hit and miss on this one. Infantilism is a major problem among the disabled community, but when it comes to kids with disabilities, especially ones succeeding in doing day to day stuff, I think there’s a line of cuteness that falls within the “aww” category. The one that comes to mind is the little girl with the AFOs walking by herself for the first time. She was like 4 or 5, and it was the cutest thing ever because she was so excited. Now if you put that next to a typical baby taking her first steps, it’s probably only cute for family and friends. 

Similar to this are the cochlear implant “hearing for the first time” videos, “baby gets glasses and sees for the first time” videos, and even the adult “color blind man sees color for the first time” videos. 

I guess it boils down to folks with disabilities hitting major milestones *can* be considered cute depending on the reaction. People who have disabilities going about their day to day life? Not cute. ",,,20,0,0,

Stigma sucks, and I understand it. Electric wheelchairs were on my list of real possibilities and internalised ableism/the stigma was a big reason I decided against it. I've come rapidly downhill from ok mobility through canes to a wheelchair, the idea of using a joystick when I feel so active and want people to see me as active still, it was killing me. That's something I need time to get over, you know?

Instead I went for something like, way more expensive. It may be an option for you if you have family that can help you front the money or anchor a finance plan (my family fronted money which I am paying back). I got a lightweight custom manual chair with a power add on. In my case, the Alber E Motion M 25 wheels. I'm still waiting for it all to arrive, but from the trial I did, I can zoom across carpet at high speed by nudging them with two fingers they're so powerful. If you pay a small amount extra in the app you can also get a cruise control mode in case the powered manual mode is still rough for you say, going up hills or w/e (it does have roll back protection in case that's a worry).

The Smart Drive MX2+ is also popular, but I found it very difficult to control. It was prone to veering off at the slightest hint of a gradient, I needed serious strength to fight it to stay straight, and if there was any water/damp on the ground? Forget it, I could fight all I liked the Smart Drive just powered off in the direction it wanted to go and aquaplaned the wheel I was gripping.

Wheelchair services NHS are not gonna fund something like the E Motions/Smart Drive unless you really win the postcode lottery though, but it's worth a shot so speak to your GP if you want to go the chair route about a referral to them.",,,1,0,0,

589f63c3-bad5-4542-ac39-e0e5a5dc6591,1552270991,"This is something I've been researching a lot due to my mom's increasing needs. Sorry if I state things that are obvious to you!

Assisted Living is far more expensive than Independent Living.  The difference is getting the meals and medical care as part of the package.  Independent Living has a lot less offered; the place my mom lives is a tiny apartment with one hot meal on weekdays and no medical care save a nurse that comes by once a month to do a basic health check for those who want it.

Without any insurance, Assisted Living places usually run $2000-$3000 a month, and that's for standard care. Luxury places can run $5000/month or more.

Without savings, eldercare insurance, or family help, it's hard for people on SSI, SSDI, and/or VA benefits to meet that kind of fee, so they ""make it work""  but try not to take everything.

The reason it all balances out the same, no matter how much medical care you need *right now*, is that in theory you're going to need more medical care as you age. It's the same way that (standard) health or car insurance works -- you pay whether or not you have used the insurance yet, because there's the possibility that you'll need it tomorrow.

Take care.",,,3,0,0,

The links below are to commercial sites that publish generally reputable legal information. I read the information on these pages and it seems accurate, and a bit more comprehensive than other information I found on non profit and governmental sites.

Here is some helpful information about medical debt from the National Comsumer Law Center [https://library.nclc.org/dealing-medical-debt-consumer-advice-nclc](https://library.nclc.org/dealing-medical-debt-consumer-advice-nclc).

As you know, income from SSDI is exempt from judgement (judgment proof), meaning that if a debt collector sues you in court and wins a judgment against you, you can file a particular verification of income and assets with the relevant court that will prevent them from collecting judgment from any income received from SSDI. See this information from Nolo about judgment proof. [https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-does-judgment-proof-mean.html](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-does-judgment-proof-mean.html).

If you are being harassed by creditors, one option may be to send cease and desist letters, particularly if all of your income and assets are exempt from judgment under law. See for example this information from Nolo about cease and desist letters. [https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/should-i-tell-debt-collector-stop-contacting-me.html](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/should-i-tell-debt-collector-stop-contacting-me.html).

If you are looking for help with your options, there are non profit law offices in some areas that provide help with consumer law and debt collection defense and other consumer or financial services organizations that provide other help with consumer debtor rights or information about your options with medical debt. A long time ago, I used to work (in a non attorney role) for a non profit law office that helped people draft cease and desist and judgment proof letters and helped people defend themselves in debt collection actions. There might be a similar group or program in your area.

If you are not familiar with groups in your area that might help, your local senior center, center for independent living, social workers at your medical providers office, or 211 information and referral service might be able to direct you to additional help or resources available in your area. 

Additionally, in each state there are Medicare health insurance counseling programs that might be able to help you find affordable additional coverage if needed for your care.  Some people might be eligible for additional help or assistance with Medicare and not be aware of it due in part to their very complex rules. These Medicare health insurance counselors should be trained in help you get the most out of your Medicare and any other help, programs or supplementals you might be able to qualify for or afford. Here is a list of Medicare health insurance counseling programs by each state.

Now, as far as being 40 and a single male... you are focusing on the negatives. What is something you can do? Do you play an instrument? Do you draw? Do you cook? There must be something you CAN do so find a class, volunteer group, something that helps you to feel better about yourself. Surround yourself with other people that are passionate with something you can do. This will help build confidence. Maybe not overnight, but when you feed your soul, the emptiness goes away. 
My partner and I met when I was 40 and he was 39. Yes, I have been married before and have a child, however, he was living with his sister and brother in law. I never looked down at him for it. For me, the fact he valued family was one of my top priorities in my life. Find someone who also values family. There are women out there.

There are many, many ways to learn about handling finances. If I were you, I would break everything down financially and come up with a plan that looks at all the money coming in and going out. It may seem overwhelming, but if you break it all down and make a plan where you have goals, it can help with finding a way to get rid of debt, establishing boundaries over who pays for what, and can help sort of clear the overwhelming trapped feeling. Again, it may not be right away, but in time, you can chip away at it and feel more independent.

In the end, their opinion barely matters since it’s the disability law judges that make that decision.  Let your doctor treat you &amp; document whatever they think is best.  Although you certainly still want to ask for anything you need, be it a disabled parking pass, a new test or medication.  Their documentation will hopefully support your case if you decide to apply for SSDI.

Unfortunately most doctors have been turned off by people who falsely claim disability benefits so if your case is solid, it will stand on its own without your doctor doing anything more than treating you for your disabilities.",,,2,0,0,

Do you live alone? Married? With family? You’ll want to see if you qualify for SSI, considering your work I do not believe you will qualify for SSDI, but you may. Being 21 makes it much harder. You’re work credits expire sooner than people over 30. Again, to make it easier to deny you. 

When I was looking to apply I was told I better work as long as I could until I was at least 30 before even attempting it. However, I’m completely unable to work full time. And so I’m fighting for disability. I have the work credits for SSDI, I am married and we are not low income with my husbands sole income and so I do not qualify for SSI. 

Also, in IL btw. I guarantee you’ll be denied at first, and probably your appeal with be denied as well. You’ll have to go in front of a judge and plead your case. This process is about 2 years long. 

Basically, if there’s any way to work and get those work credits up, do it. And while you do it DOCUMENT EVERYTHING every little thing that you can get notated by your doctor get it done. It’ll help you in the long run.

I've always been independent in a sense. In college, I had two part time jobs. My family allowed me to live at home in exchange for rent that I paid through my SSI and through help I provided to their business. So when I couldn't pay cash, I would put in time or labor so to speak. 

Now that I am on my own, I am struggling with how to survive on a cash basis instead of a trade or skill basis. I can't lose my medicaid because of health issues. At the same time, I have no idea about my long-term situation because of the instability I am currently facing.

Does she need help bathing, dressing, going to the bathroom, or getting in/out of bed? Does she need help preparing food or doing laundry? Does she need someone to remind her to take medication or take her to doctors appointments? Does she just need help in the mornings and evenings, or does she need assistance all day?

The next step would be to contact the IHSS to find out exactly what level of care she qualifies for and how they pay for or reimburse the caregivers. If they reimburse you for the cost, you could probably reach out to local nursing schools about how to post a job opportunity. If they don't reimburse you, you'll want to look through their list of caregivers or reach out to home health care agencies who have experience working with the IHSS.

SSI is the program for people with lifelong disability and it’s actually a Social *Supplementary* Income program more or less used to “incentivize” disabled people to work. It’s not a very stable program and puts the disabled person’s medical burdens on their spouse, which is why many disabled people choose to never marry or cohabit should they be lucky enough to find a partner. Some find themselves in the position of divorce simply because they cannot manage their health costs without Medicaid.

First, if I get pregnant and it’s either wanted or I’ve decided to continue the pregnancy and become a parent, that means I’ve accepted whatever may come- that includes any health challenges or any other things my child has to deal with. That’s being a parent, right? Supporting your kid, making sure they’re safe and cared for, getting them appropriate health care, stuff like that...


But if someone is overwhelmed and unable to cope with being a parent... shouldn’t they just give them up? Surely being in care is better than being poisoned and killed by a parent. I’d hope they’d seek out therapy or some type of help before that point...

14785515-c31e-4504-b412-8d1125a6cbe4,1553799531,"So I have a form of MD also.   Basically, I have low self esteem when it comes to physical attraction, I find it extremely difficult to find a relationship let alone dates. I've done years of online dating and some females are nice and simply politely decline while others say they could never date a guy in a wheelchair.  Others ask if everything works sexually while some ask if they would have to help you in the bathroom.  My chances of getting replies were much higher when I omitted anything about my disability in my profile, but it led to a lot of time wasted on females who would never date a guy in a wheelchair.  So I put the wheelchair in the profile and responses went from 5% to almost zero.  I say ""almost"" because I did arrange a couple dates with the wheelchair profile, only to have them cancel before the date could take place.  And just fyi, I wasn't being picky, I was willing to go on a date with almost anyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I have put myself out there to women in the real world, like at a party or out in public, I have been rejected 100% of the time.  Maybe my self confidence shows or I don't have any 'game.'  Eventually I had the misguided thinking that female friends could be potential partners but that's a fallacy as well.  In fact, I wasted most of my life trying to get to know girls as friends only to be firmly friend-zoned.  So I would advise anyone with a disability to not try this method, it really is a cluster.  Don't be friends with anyone of the opposite sex, and if you do, tell them right away if you develop feelings -- not years later.

If you already have an appointment with the rheumatologist then it doesnt hurt to ask her, she may or may not be able to help out. If she questions why you need a chair just tell her what you said in your post, basically that it helps you to do everyday activities you otherwise couldnt do due to pain. Being able to get out and about is also great for mental health as well as sitting at home gets old quick.

 I'm not sure how insurance in the US works eg if you say you already have a chair (even a $50 one) does that mean they'll say theres no reason to fund one? (Is this a situation where you say you borrowed the chair as opposed to woning it?) Ideally if they will fund it getting a chair fitted specifically for you then thats the way to go. It'll be more comfortable and also set up to avoid causing you more pain/fatigue. Plus a light weight chair is heaps easier to either self propel or have your SO push you, also easier to chuck in and out of the car. 

Good luck ��

*edit: the person who fits the chair will be the one who writes the 'script' ie what configuration you need for a chair. The specialist may be able to provide documentation to insurance as to why a chair would be recommended for you and any specific concerns that the person fitting you needs to take into consideration.

I just need to get the data unfortunately. I have a makeshift chair I can put my knee on (it's surprisingly a good height and even cushioned well) during the experiment, and I got a kitchen mat. So about as accessible as it can be regarding the space I'm in (mostly concrete..). 

I hope your ulcer gets better, that sounds scary. 

Sorry about the shutter haha. I don't technically have a diagnosis (because ""there's nothing we can do"" blah blah blah) but based on the MRI, I probably have a ""chronically expanding hematoma"" - basically, an injury that never healed (it doesn't constantly expand, it's a bad name Lol). So there's this weird commonly inflamed-with-activity part, and then further back there's a kind of fibrous wall that stops the blood from being reabsorbed into my muscle/wherever like it's usually supposed to. So it's like solid and liquid and all kinds of weird sensations (tingling and whatnot), especially if using benzocaine. But I've gotten used to it tbh, and somehow there was this terrible nerve pain I'd get when I walked on that foot, and it's gone now and I don't know why? So now it feels more like an actual bruise/sore spot which I can deal with much better. I must've done something when walking on my foot with benzocaine that helped (at least, moved something out of the way of the nerve?).

Anyway, I'm rambling. Feet, at least my foot, is very mysterious.

Depending on how new your GP is, I would make an appointment and be up front with the scheduler that the appointment is to obtain paperwork to support a disability claim, this way your doctor knows right off the bat. If they're relatively new and not familiar with you and your conditions, during the appointment I would start by explaining to your doctor what your limitations are, why you are unable to work, and that these reasons are what led you to have to apply for disability. Then, just ask if they would feel comfortable filling out the paper for you to support your claim. Explaining your reasoning first, especially if your new GP doesn't really know you that well, will allow them to see your perspective and in what ways your conditions are limiting you, and will help them decide whether or not they are on board. Just go in confident and ready to explain your situation and answer any questions they may have, and if they decide they don't feel comfortable filling it out for you, you could always try whichever doctor you have a longer history with that has treated you and that is most familiar with your circumstances (psychiatrist, rheumatologist, etc)

And if doing this in person is stressful for you and you're afraid of them saying no, you could always try leaving a message for them with the receptionists and waiting for a response that way, and just making an appointment if they agree to fill it out.

Good luck!!!

The people posting this doesn't see people with downs as humans and equals. This is sub mostly full of pets, even your description and picture is of animals. By posting it here it likenes the man to a cute animal. This is harmful to the disabled community at large. It's called inspiration porn and it is horrible! It creates the idea that as disabled people we exist only to inspire able bodied people. It's objectifys and dehumanizes us. It also creates the idea that we must always be inspiring, we shouldn't be allowed to feel pain or be upset by the fact that we are disabled. We exist only to inspire. And its harmful to other members of the disabled community. All disabilities exist on a spectrum of ability and functioning, everyone is different. Inspiration porn tells able bodied people disabled people only matter or have value when they are on the high end of functioning and ability. It also causes able bodied people to assume all disable people are capable of doing anything they put their mind to, and if they aren't they are just lazy. I'm fine with disabled people inspiring other disabled people, but when it's for the consumption of able bodied people it's fetshizing us. It should be shameful and not tolerated in our modern society. This disabled community needs you to take a stand for us. To show the world you won't tolerate us being seen as anything less than human. Also keep in mind, this is obeservers recording and posting this video. Not the man himself. We don't know if he consented to filming at all. This isn't him wanting to be seen as aww, this able bodied people declaring him aww. Please help the disabled community and take a stand for us.

There is a good possibility that with a proper diagnosis and treatment, you may very well be able to work and without the challenges you foresee (or with tools to manage them). 

I know it's scary and overwhelming, but it's important that you get medical help. Then you can figure out the next step.

Also, you don't have a W-2...you get that from an employer to file taxes. If you don't work, you don't have one. You may need your parents assistance to help with some of this. 

You mention that you have a supportive family. Talk to your parents and be honest.  As a parent myself, I expect they want you to be healthy, happy and independent and they can't help you if they don't know what's going on.

Even though it sounds like I might have a lot of difficulty with daily tasks I function pretty okay on my own.  I'm 23 and I go to work, hang with my friends, play video games, can draw.  But I really struggle talking to girls that I like. Its mostly a self confidence thing I think, I really dont like being in photos as well.  For the majority of my life this doesn't bother me, as I have good friends and family that support me, but now that I'm getting older and am now out of school I'm paying more attention to finding a girl to spend my time and life with.

I have recently installed dating apps but it's been pretty unsuccessful, probably because I mostly have pretty mediocre pictures, but I dont think better photos are necessarily the answer.  Again I am also not trying to catfish anyone either, but it is hard to find a genuine connection.  I am also an Asian male, which is arguably less desirable by society's standards, but I'm not really going to go into that now.

When I was in school I would talk to *some* girls, but I rarely had the courage to ask them out.  I have asked a couple of girls out (in really awkward or cringey ways in hindsight), and I don't regret it for the most part besides some of the execution, but now that I'm out of school I now see how much harder it is to meet new people.

I don't really know what I should do, I am hoping that I will find someone some day.  Inaction doesn't seem like the answer but being proactive is also definitely challenging.  Any advice is welcome, again I'm pretty much at a loss for what to do.  Going to work is all right but having someone to work for would be way better.

I then went on to try underarm crutches and liked them better than forearm ones because I was able to lean into them a lot more. Underarm crutches generally go from the floor to about 2in below your arm pits. Your arm pits should not sit directly on the pads but crutches should be a little lower than this so as to prevent nerve damage to the arm pit area. I generally would hold onto the handles and lean the arm pads between my arm and ribs etc. Take time to mess about with them. Try out different heights etc.

Having a friend like you willing to help will go a long way. (Especially if you're abled in ways your friend isn't.)

I recommend figuring out what are her limits/boundaries and what are her resources. 

For example, I have a place with some roommates, and can host people at my house for games and movies. If I knew people, I could invite them over. 

You could act as a screener/introducer for her-- make new friends/meet people and if they're safe (not ableist assholes) talk to her about having this new person to her house. She doesn't have to leave, so it's a safe area, and it's just one new person, with you, a familiar friend, present. Or have them both at your place and pick her up. 

It's going to look different depending on the situation, but if you analyze the limits and resources then you can come up with a custom solution. A lot of being disabled is DIY. ",,,3,0,0,

@OP

The main questions are:

* His stability and cycling experience prior to the accident,
* What he has left on his amputated arm,
* His age and sense of adventure.

Two approaches are possible :

* Using an adaptive handlebar where he can put his stump and therefore cycle with both arms,

* Keeping a totally upright position on the bike, so he will steer with the remaining arm, but won't put any weight on them.

If he is not too stable or is a casual cyclist, he should go for a tricycle. He could get lots of speed with a ""tadpole recumbent"" ($$$) or could stay with a more traditional tricycle. 

Alternatively, if he has either little experience or low motricity / stability, one option would be to cycle with somebody on a tandem. The stoker (aka back seat driver) doesn't need to be stable and doesn't steer the tandem either.",,,1,0,0,

I'm going to be blunt, but from my heart, not to be mean. Your good friend can't live alone but maybe can't fully live without constant supervision. Therefore, a group home would be a very good idea.

If he is on either SSI or SSDI, he'll be fine. You'll have to have a doctor do a write up about his ADL's (activities of daily living). What can your friend literally do without assistance and to what degree in light of the after affects of the coma as well as the epilepsy.

You could start looking up group homes now. Ideally your friend should have either a legal guardian or someone who is his power of attorney because of his situation, that'll make it easier with the group homes you'll be looking up. Gently start conversing with your friend about this a bit at a time. Heck, Britney Spears even has a conservator, none of that is bad.

I don't qualify for SSI so I don't know it very well but this cannot be correct. I have had friends on SSI that were students in HS and college students.

Some [quick googling](https://blog.thearc.org/2017/07/06/ssi-makes-allowances-student-finances/) also says that people receiving SSI can even receive scholarships that will not count against them so long as they use the money for college expenses within a certain time frame.

All over the world, disabled communities are more and more adopting Identity first language - Disabled poeple, and the social model, realising that PFL is based on very loose thought out, pardon my french, BS. I'm sorry that's what you believe, but this sentence says it all ""the people who Work with disabled poeple"".

So, not disabled poeple themselves, then? I find that a lot of disabled people who also adopt PFL do so because they view disability the same way as an able bodied person does. Change the perspective, you change the language, and finally see the flaws in the paternalistic attitude towards disability.

And also, most disabled people Are defined by their disability. Their abilities in every day life are shaped by what their disability allows them to do, they work with their disabilities. I went to a special needs school, because I'm disabled, I became friends with the poeple I became friends with, because we were all disabled, I've gone through the experiences I've gone through because I'm disabled.

The rules regarding working and obtaining or maintaining Social Security disability benefits are complex and your experienced attorney who is familiar with these rules and the details of your case should be in the best position to advise how work could impact your claim.

In general it can take between 2-6 months (sometimes longer sometimes shorter) after hearing to receive the ALJ decision, mostly depending on the circumstances at the judge’s office. 

Also, you mentioned that your doctors have not yet released you for work. In addition to checking with your attorney, you may want to consult with your doctor as well about work. It sounds like it is possible you may still be recovering and may risk injury, and should probably check with your doctor about any medical risks in returning to work.

But equally if you're in an area where appointments to the appropriate specialist take 6 months, don't feel bad starting using an aid before then. Try taking them to your PCP if you're going to do that and see if they have any basic advice on whether you seem to be using them correctly, so you don't do any damage to yourself while waiting for your ""real"" appointment to come through.

Personally I find physios to be very anti-mobility aid, at least here. They're all about stabilising and strengthening and flex emojis. I think it sometimes helps them Chill Out if you accede to do exercises they prescribe *at the same time as* using the mobility aid. They grumble but it often gets them on board because they think they're secretly winning because Soon(tm) you will be stronger and not need the mobility aid at all, ha ha, you see, and all without you even knowing their plan.

So tell your physio you want a regimen of exercises to do to keep/build strength in the appropriate areas while you use the crutches, and hopefully they will agree to show you how to use crutches and even prescribe you some, or another mobility aid they feel is better for you. 

Similarly if your PCP gives you flak, tell them you're on your way to the physio/whatever to get them strengthening exercises (physio flex emoji) so that you won't decondition, and should in fact gain condition.

You know CFS doesn't work like that, but *they* will all be sitting feeling very proud of themselves for getting a patient to do Strengthening Exercises (*flex emoji*).",,,2,0,0,

My 12 year old son is autistic and I have been both amazed and horrified by some of things I've seen and heard since his diagnosis. I knew quite a bit about autism before because of various work and volunteering I had done but man, the crap that neurotypicals try to push on autistic people is staggering. Like ABA? Omg what a bad experience. I was incredibly hesitant because I will always, always listen to autistic adults for advice about my son over any NTs (no matter how many letters they have behind their name. I just don't think we get it) and so I was not wanting to do any ABA at all. His developmental psych convinced me that it had radically changed, it was the only thing that could help him function in the world, it didn't even really resemble the ABA that autistic adults remember. Well bullshit! They were all concerned about the wrong things; eye contact, following commands, taking the very few things he loves away from him to use as ""reinforcement"". We lost a whole summer to this and he regressed which they tried to tell me was ""normal"".

It was just immensely frustrating and since I stopped letting anybody but the supervisor come, and then only once a week, he has made huge progress in the very few areas I care about; self advocacy, self esteem, and self management. You know what worked? I told him very plainly why those things were important for him and then left him the hell alone about it and he did the work himself. When he asks for something that he needs I do it right away. When he tells me something he did that he's proud of I listen carefully and say, ""wow, that's awesome!"". When he needs to get something done I remind him one time and then don't bring it up again and he does it.

I'm sorry, I could rant about this all day but suffice to say I really kick myself sometimes for not just listening to autistic adults and keeping out of the ABA. We're getting some pretty bad fall out from the doctor but I'm trying not to care. He reamed me for stopping ABA, put notes in his medical record that we aren't to be offered any other services, made me feel like a shit mom.

02faf140-582d-40b6-aa23-d19972deec5a,1552119935,"There’s no rationale for this that will ever resonate with me.    
    
The only rationale ever offered in cases like this is “death is better than an existance of suffering; so even if a person can’t express consent for death it’s obviously what they desire.” But... the human experience is so incredibly varied and amazingly adaptable. I mean, to start, just consider what in the US we call the Pain Scale: where people are asked to give a number representing their baseline experience of pain and other numbers representing their current and target pain levels. This process is used because pain is both subjective &amp; a sensation that can be adapted to through mental &amp; medical means.    
    
“Suffering” is a concept even further abstracted from the experience of pain. I can only parse the idea of “suffering” as a comparison; since being in a state of nearly unbearable distress, by definition of distress, means there is a baseline to compare with. So... how can an otherwise stable, if disabled, person who has never experienced life in any capacity other than the status they are born with be considered in constant distress; how can they be labeled as “suffering?” Only by using an abled standard... an unachievable standard and a logically prohibitive one unless the logic used is discriminatory. A child of three whose experience of life includes the disabilities described shouldn’t be considered to be *suffering* simply because they are living the only life they are capable of living.    
    
Most of us who are disabled and/or living with chronic pain can probably agree that if we describe ourselves as “suffering” it is due to the fact that we are capable of comparing our current experience to previous, better baselines or are comparing our capabilities/existence to those who are more abled. That poor murdered child had nothing to compare his existence to, &amp; therefore no means with which to suffer. He only had his existence. And now he does not.

Personally they’re a really stupid idea and I put that out there for my legislators when I recently saw them. Why? Because when someone loses it or grandma dies, they’re not going to be turned in, there will just be more of them out there that appear valid for scofflaws to use.  There are quite a few car break ins where these hang tags are the target for theft.  Good luck getting handicap parking with these out there (it is already damn difficult). Look into why DC no longer has free meter parking for the disabled and it is now red top meters — major abuse of this “perk” (there are several WaPo articles detailing the abuse including government employees who would park for 4 hours in front of their buildings then swap spots with another employee so they never had to pay for parking and of course the tags didn’t belong to them anyway). 

And as to renewal when you have a personal disability? In this state every 10 years they’ll send you a letter for you to sign affirming you’re still disabled and send back.",,,2,0,0,

I don't know how it works in France, but in many parts of the 1st world there is a time limit involved in this after which you're not able to give the kid up and your only option is to do something that would require the government or the other parent to take custody (usually this means abuse or neglect).

In the United States its usually 3-4 years of age. I would imagine most European countries are similar. 

There was a big story about this in the United States a few years ago where in one state a legal technicality suddenly allowed parents to give their kids up at any age and the state was surprised to be inundated with parents wanting to offload their teen &amp; preteen kids.

The inside of the house looks like [this](https://l7.alamy.com/zooms/feb67132eaac42ac96094de68d357c55/storage-unit-garage-messy-cemb6e.jpg) everywhere. There's so much stuff that I can set something down in it right in front of me and it just disappears. I can't see it, it gets lost in all the clutter. Things get lost *all the time.* It drives me crazy. I sleep in a small storage room in the back, there's barely room for the little air bed I sleep on and a narrow path to get to the door. After a year and a half I saved up and splurged on a light cover because staring up at that one exposed light bulb in the ceiling was making me depressed.

The guy I rent a room from is a nice guy he's just kind of casual and fatalistic: ""whatever happens, happens."" The house is in disrepair. The outside lights don't work. He has replacements, he just doesn't install them. Many of the inside lights don't work, either. Another kitchen light went out the other day, he just laughed and said that's the universe's way of telling him to replace the lights but he doesn't do it. If I go into the kitchen after sunset I have to use my headlamp. 

I have no idea who built this house but I don't think a lot of it was to code. There's no attic, just like a 6"" space where pigeons were nesting - I actually pushed on that one to get them removed and some mesh put up to cover the gaps in the trim they were using to get in and out. There was such a thick layer of droppings that the guys who came to clean it had to use these big rake things to get it all out. Little places in the exterior walls are open to the outside. There's a big cockroach problem. Sometimes I find mice, too.

There's gas heating which I think works but he never uses it. We each have little electric space heaters that we move to whichever room we're using. There's no A/C expect for a window unit in the back room which is why I sleep there (summers are really hot).

For some reason none of the outlet boxes are attached to anything so you have to really be careful when you put in or remove a plug. The wall plaster has a lot of holes, some big ones, some small ones that have nail holes and such that no one ever repaired. The door frames and hinges are so messed up that most of the doors don't close correctly. Closet and cabinet doors are missing. Part of the bathroom vanity is missing.

The backyard fence broke and now his dogs can't go out there without a leash (he takes them on long walks 3 times a day so they're not lacking any exercise but I think they really miss running around the yard). The outside trim and windows are flaking lead paint (yes, lead, it's been tested). There's a big cracked window pane in front, some kid threw a hard ball at it. The weeds in the yard are over 4' high. Every now and then someone complains about the house and the city fines him for the mess in the yard, he'll miss a few deadlines and then pay a big fine and mow it (he has a mower). Someone kicked down our mail box so we don't have one anymore. I get my mail at a PO box so that's not an issue for me but I swear it makes the house look even more abandoned. 

Laundry is a HUGE PITA for me because I have to borrow a car, and carry stuff to the car, from the car into the laundromat, from machine to machine, then back to the car, and back into the house. Believe me, that is more than I can handle. *I hate it so fucking much.* I finally bought a rolling basket but it still has to be lugged around. 

The thing is, he has a nice washer and dryer. The laundry room is outside the house in a shed which is missing part of one wall. It's filled with crap and the neighborhood cats use it as a litter box. The washer and dryer sit outside unused, under tarps. I asked him why he doesn't use it for laundry and he said he'd have to rent a truck to bring a wood panel home to repair the wall and he doesn't want to do that. 

Needless to say the place is filthy. Dishes sit in the sink, food containers aren't closed. I have no idea when any floor was last cleaned. As I said, there's a roach problem. I have chronic pulmonary issues and this makes my breathing *so much worse* than it has to be. The pulmonologist warned me against being anywhere near dust mites and cleaning chemicals with reduced lung function, but when the toilet gets too bad I have to clean it. I sit in the back room with a HEPA air cleaner going all the time. The crumbling lead paint scares the living *crap* out of me. It literally keeps me up at night.

I'm not bed-ridden but I have limited mobility and all the clutter makes it hard for me to move around. I trip over stuff all the time which drives me crazy. I can't stand having anything underfoot, I never have. I have trouble taking care of myself, I need help with that and I don't have any. I can't keep house for two people and dogs, I just can't. 

The guy who owns the place is from another country and culture. I'm not knocking anyone's culture, just trying to give some context to it. This kind of stuff doesn't seem that unusual to him. I think he's also used to having a mom and sisters who did stuff for him so without them, it just doesn't get done. 

I don't want to seem ungrateful, without him giving me a place to sleep I'd have probably lost everything and be living in a culvert by now. But by nature I'm minimal and super clean. [This](http://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Urban-chic-bedroom-with-a-semi-minimal-approach.jpg) is my idea of what a room should look like - and even that makes me uncomfortable because the blanket is touching the floor!!

I do know that colleges are required to provide accommodations to students with disabilities, provided the students provide proper documentation. In high school, students with IEPs or 504 plans automatically receive the accommodations they need because they have an IEP or 504 plan. In college, students must provide the documentation and request the accommodations themselves. 

Colleges vary widely in how they provide accommodations. Some of them have testing centers, etc for students who need extended time, a scribe, or a test read aloud. Some of them don't really have a formal system.

 Whether we are disabled or not, there will be some who think negatively of us.

 Loved ones protect each other.  I know it's easy to say, but really, if someone is so harsh as to look down on you, even after learning your story, then you have done your best and will have to distance yourself.

Im glad you have an understanding husband.

You may need to defend yourself in the future -- and to yourself -- because not working feels wrong.

Yoi may need ways to make yourself feel useful.  Being disabled can wreck your self-esteem. It takes a new frame of mind to handle these feelings, including real or imagined scrutiny and scorn from others.

I know from experience.  I gave up on dating because people don't respect someone who doesn't have a job.  Social stigma can serve its purpose -- if it were acceptable to stay at home and get ""free money"", our society would upend itself.  But we can't help it if we are disabled.  
Most people aren't going to be outwardly rude.  What they think --  but not directly express --  can drive you to distraction as you imagine the worst.  Your antennae may become overly sensitive to real or perceived slights.

I think anyone who wants to know and love you will inderstand that you want to work.  You  shouldn't have to  defend yourself so strenuously and continuously.   (I'm personally glad I don't have to host relatives or be around nasty people anymore.  It is hard for those of us who aren't able to keep up appearances.)

I worked in an HR-related field for a few years long ago and I actually have some experience on the employer side of this. Here's an excerpt from some literature published by the federal Department of Labor:

- Myth: Under the ADA, employers must give people with disabilities special privileges, known as accommodations.

- Fact: Reasonable accommodations are intended to ensure that qualified individuals with disabilities have rights in employment equal—not superior—to those of individuals without disabilities. A reasonable accommodation is a modification to a job, work environment or the way work is performed that allows an individual with a disability to apply for a job, perform the essential functions of the job, and enjoy equal access to benefits available to other individuals in the workplace.

- Myth: The ADA is frequently misused by people with vague complaints or diagnoses.

- Fact: If an individual files a complaint of discriminatory treatment, denial of accommodation or harassment under the ADA and does not have a condition that meets its definition of disability, the complaint is dismissed. While claims by people with false or minor conditions may get considerable media attention, the reality is that these complaints are usually dismissed.

Essentially, doing something to accommodate one employee doesn't change anything for other employees' work situation. No precedent is set. To be eligible for accommodation, a person has to have an actual disability under the definition of the ADAAA, which means a condition that substantially limits one or more life activities. Seeing a therapist doesn't qualify as a disability. An anxiety disorder does, and the criteria for being diagnosed are specific and significant. Your life has to be massively impacted. The same is true for PTSD, and Asperger's (high-functioning autism), and depression, etc., all of which are conditions I have.

So, IF an employee has a qualifying disability, the definition of a ""reasonable"" accommodation depends entirely on the unique specific circumstances taking into account both employee needs and employer resources. If they didn't have an office available, asking for one would likely be unreasonable, which is why I worked for 4.5 years without one, although it was a daily challenge.

In their response to my current request, my employer is making some false assumptions: I worked in a cubicle (with accommodations) in the past, so it should be fine in the new location. That isn't necessarily true. Not every cubicle is created equal, and in my case it's the location that matters. In the new spot, the flourescent overhead lights are different and more triggering, and the bathroom and kitchen are in extremely close proximity. Bathrooms and kitchens are problematic for me on a number of levels. I have a really sensitive sense of smell as well as germaphobia, and kitchen/bathroom smells when I'm trying to work are distracting and distressing. The upstairs bathrooms have those Dyson airblade things that are super loud, even through the door/wall, and they startle the heck out of me. They didn't have those downstairs, and my cubicle was really far away from the bathrooms and kitchen anyway. Sensory processing disorder affects me such that too much incoming auditory, visual, and olfactory stimuli - smells from microwaved food, people walking around, bathroom doors slamming (the way the hydraulics are they slam shut hard and loudly), toilets flushing, hand dryer noises, smells from the bathrooms, the radio of the other person who sits in the open area, conversation and chatter from all directions, bright overhead lights, phones ringing, employees chewing gum, typing, people's cologne and perfume, and on and on and on - it all causes my brain to go into fight/flight/freeze mode. It puts me into a continual state of hypervigilance that affects my mind and body. There's only so much cubicle walls and noise-cancelling headphones can do. (I wear my headphones everywhere, every second of every day that I'm not in my house, including at work. Have for years. They're a godsend in the grocery store.)

I'm sorry for digressing, but even if you were merely playing devil's advocate, what you said reflects really common and inaccurate stigma about people with mental illness and about disability accommodations in general. It's hurtful and perpetuates negative stereotypes which is the last thing anyone needs.

I'm not using my diagnoses to try to game the system. I'm on permanent disability - the bar for getting Social Security Disability for mental illness is pretty damn high - and I don't have to work. But having somewhere to go every day, a job to do, even part-time, is vital for my mental health. It stabilizes me and helps keep me from becoming too isolated.

I'm worried about their cubicle solution because, based on what I know of my involuntary reactions to certain stimuli, I don't think it's going to work. I'll try my best to work in the cubicle, but based on past history I believe the increased stress will eventually take its toll in the form of increased absenteeism and reduced performance.

I'm not the kind of person who plays the disability card constantly. When I have an acceptable workspace, I perform very well and I work hard. I have a job that requires constant concentration: if I lose focus, I make mistakes, and I don't get as much done. Mistakes cost my employer money. So does reduced productivity.

This is only the second time I've ever asked for accommodations at a job, the first time being this same job when I started. Then, it was all worked out informally and even though things weren't ideal, my boss was up front with me, and I knew he did the best he could to meet my needs. I made myself worth it by working hard and doing a damn good job. I still do. I don't think it's too much to ask that they let me work in what would otherwise be an empty damn office, since it benefits them at least as much as it benefits me.",,,1,0,0,

1. If they let you remain in the office if they eventually hire someone to fill it they'll have to kick you out and build you the cubicle anyways, but with probably a shorter time frame. So it makes sense to just proactively address it.

2. If they give you the office as an accomadation (even though in this case it makes sense with it being empty) it sets a precedent that would result in them having to give an office to everyone who can get a letter from a therapist saying they have a little add or anxiety (though your issues are way more serious than that). And if they weren't wiling to give everyone like that an office they could face legal consequences. Long term building endless offices would cost a ton of money, and more than building cubicles. I would honestly be concerned about any business willing to take that risk no matter how much they want to give you that office.

At the end of the day while it might not be the best accommodation, it does seem like a reasonable one. And definitely the best one for the business to make. What I would recommend is that you have your therapist submit another letter listing things the cubical thing needs to have. Also, asking for like the desk farthest away from the bathroom/kitchen or in the corner would be reasonable. But I'm sorry, honestly asking for an office that are exclusive to supervisor isn't a reasonable accomadtion because it could eventually need to be used for a supervisor.

I'm sorry if that seem tough, I'm just trying to be realistic with you so you have the best chance of getting the accomadtions you need to function.

Edit: Also, if you continue to push to get the office after you are being offered a reasonable accommodation I worry you'll lose your job. I think because they are offering a different solution to accommodate it(which they are investing money into, which really means going above reasonable accomadtion), in court what they are doing would be rule reasonable accomadtion and your request would be ruled unreasonable. The company is doing what is best for business while still meeting the law. I feel like if you try to fight that you're going to burn serious bridges. I get how horribly frustrating it might be, but I'd hate to see you lose your job. However, I mean if you get to the point where you dislike this company enough to quit, I'm all for burning bridges and teaching lessons on your way out.",,,8,0,0,

By SSI rules you are required to report any income received by the 10th day of the following month. I strongly recommend that you do not report prospective earnings (income you hope to receive soon but have not yet got). Report the income promptly after you actually receive it. 

To avoid problems, make sure you make it clear to SSA that this is not recurring income. Provide proof that this is income that started and stopped by a specific date, to avoid SSA mistaking this as ongoing income and making deductions after the earning have already stopped. 

The rules for how SSI counts earned income from an ineligible spouse in determining your payment amount are complex and several deductions apply.

If you are receiving food stamps, you should report this income as well to the office that administers your food stamps. In some states you may be required to report it within a month after it is received, and in other areas you can just report it on your next quarterly or semiannual report. If you receive food stamps and have questions about reporting income, I strongly recommend contacting your food stamps worker or local food stamps office.

For periods of temporary or irregular earnings, Medicaid should average the additional income annually instead of determining non eligibility for a month or two. Generally, a brief period of modest extra earned income (such as $3000 over a month or two) should not interruption Medicaid eligibility because of the annual averaging rules.  

Depending on the amount of earnings, when they are received, over how long, and deductions that will apply, you may or may not see an interruption in your SSI eligibility. Your payment amount might be reduced temporarily or you may not receive payment for months that your income exceeds the limits, depending on how much of your spouses earned income is deemed to you after deductions. Your SSI payment should continue at their usual amounts after the additional income ends. You should report the earnings after receiving them, and make sure you report when those earnings stop to avoid problems or errors in ongoing payments.",,,5,0,0,

I hear a lot of adults with autism (not sure about kids just because I'm not around them) using them to describe themselves and help them feel bad about their capabilities. The terms ""high functioning"" and ""low functioning"" do very little to describe a single person's limitations, and instead use terms relative to other people with the condition, even if one person's inability to communicate verbally has nothing to do with another person's trouble navigating the world. Telling someone with a disability that they are ""high functioning"" only serves to diminish the struggles they experience because of that disability, and giving someone a ""low functioning"" label just sounds like bullying to me. 

I think this language was made by people without disabilities, and if it wasn't specifically designed to keep us down, they sure aren't complaining about that consequence. Because I think you're right, there are people out there who hate the disabled. I don't think those people are the majority, and I don't think they're right, but I can't pretend they're not out there.

I remember when I first got on disability every month I handed in my income declaration and every month they would call me in, tell me I needed to go get more proof, then I would go back and they would do it again. I wasn't forgetting anything they just kept adding more and more. I broke down and cried once because I was in so much pain and they told me they couldn't give me anything until I went and got even more proof. Eventually through my own research I found out I only needed to hand in those declarations if my income changed, which it never had, let alone have to provide more and more proof when I had never lied about anything. I went down to the office and told the worker that had been sending me all over town repeatedly this and she asked me how I found that out. I said ""from your government website"" and she said ""good for you for doing your homework"". She knew she had no right to be making me do all those things(I had asked her before about the declaration statements and income changing thing and she lied) but they are told to try to get rid of us so she did.

Supporting medical documentation took me a year to build up and get to them. They always seemed to want more.  Once they made a decision it was approval and I did not have to appeal anything.

I just brought a friend to a hearing a few days ago, 3 years since his initial application and it needed to go all the way to an appeal. He'll get a written decision in 45 to 90 days, though the judge sounded like he already decided, favorably I hope. My friend has a 9th grade education, was homeless when he applied and I don't think he had much help.  I'm sure this hindered his process.

I'm not a lawyer or anything but I've found that if you maximize your documentation your chances of success go up.  The sloppier *you* are, the less *they* care.

Don't forget about food stamps and other assistance.  Local community action can help in amazing ways I never would have thought.  You don't have to be on ssi or ssdi to receive help, at least not on my side of the country.

I highly suggest Toni's book. Although it does draw from Buddhist techniques such as mindfulness and meditation, I don't think it would be at odds with your Catholic faith. It doesn't push the religion on you, it only recommends using the tools associated with it. It's helped me tremendously. 

As for your family and friends, I think the best approach would be to come up with a script: ""My physicians have told me that my illnesses are permanent. Under their advice, I am finding ways to live happily and healthily with [name of illness]. I'm doing what is best for me and my new life. Let's talk about something else.""

If they try to bring it up again: ""This is not a debate or a discussion. I have [name of illness] which is permanent. It isn't going away just because you want it to. If you continue to bring this topic up, I'm going to leave (or ask you to leave if they are visiting your house).""

If they try to discuss it further: Leave (or ask them to leave). Rinse and repeat as needed. 

If you feel compelled, send them links to online information about your disease and prognosis. If Bible verses would help yourself, friends or family, I'd suggest Isaiah 43:19, Joshua 1:9, Romans 12:1-2, 2nd Corinthians 4:16-18, or my personal favorite, Romans 5:3-5 ""More than that, we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us."" Your friends and family may be reacting from fear or from a lack of understanding. However, that doesn't give them the right to ignore you and your words. They can't will your body to fully heal. No amount of prayer will change your prognosis (although it can do wonders for the soul!). You also can't force them to respect the new reality you find yourself in. Maybe with time they will understand that this isn't going away, but the choice on how much time you want to spend with people who dismiss your illnesses is up to you. 

Personally, if they haven't gotten the idea by now, I wouldn't waste my time. Life is hard enough when dealing with illnesses or disabilities without loved ones completely ignoring the writing on the wall. Surround yourself with those who understand and support you, and who don't need to be convinced of your very real illness. ",,,7,0,0,

I am their Volunteer Ombudsmen Representative (VOR).  I represent the residents in any allegations of abuse, Medicare and Medicaid problems, or general complaints against the nursing home.  I deal directly with administration.  I sometimes have to sic my bosses or Adult Protective Services on the administration when a case needs more specialized handling.  I talk with all the residents eventually, spreading the knowledge of our Federally mandated program.  I also try to catch as many family members as possible to spread the word about our program.  Each state has an state level Ombudsmen over the states program, then district level Ombudsmen to break the state into sections and then that is where we Volunteer Ombudsmen come in.  We visit from one to as many as three nursing homes and assisted living homes.  With a VOR attached to a certain nursing home we can give more intensive handling than if the district level Ombudsmen can give to that home.  It is so very rewarding, sometimes you laugh, sometimes you cry.  I have never left my nursing home without feeling I have helped a resident that visit.  There maybe no complaints, but just visiting with the residents give me my volunteer satisfaction buzz.

I used to really believe in the concept of work ethic when I was younger and worked harder than a lot of my peers at school and university and then worked in lots of different jobs before becoming a teacher. What nobody warned me about was the health risks of working 70 hours a week. Getting ill was not part of my plan and was devastating as I always saw myself working full time as a teacher. But I slowly learnt to adjust to what had happened, to look after myself to get to a better level of health which I am now working on maintaining. I think due to getting ill my baseline for what I can manage was unfortunately lowered a lot, so what I can do now is a lot less than what I used to be able to do, and less than what healthy people can do.

If you are receiving SSDI you have up to 9 months where you can earn over substantial gainful activity ($1220 in 2019) and still collect your benefits. It is called a trial work period. See this pdf brochure from SSA about their rules for working while disabled. [https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10095.pdf](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10095.pdf). If you have already exhausted your trial work period you might not be eligible for payment during those months, but should be able to resume getting payments as soon as your work period is over.

The rules for SSI are different and if you have earnings that exceed the SSI amount, you are required to report monthly earnings and your benefit will be reduced (potentially down to zero). However, SSA will generally resume SSI payments easily if your work period is relatively short (definitely under 3 months, usually up to 6 months).

Check out that brochure that gives a good and detailed overview of SSA’s rules about working and your benefits and just let me know if you have any questions. Other commentators here in this subreddit will have better tips about obtaining or maintaining employment, my experience is in SSA law and practice. Best wishes!",,,4,0,0,

When I was 8, I got my first chair and it was one of the most exciting days of my life. At the time I could only walk with great difficulty and long leg braces and crutches. My balance was terrible and I had to focus all my attention on staying upright. 
My wheelchair gave me nearly effortless mobility. I could go places on my own, I could carry something from one room to another, I could run around with friends on the playground. For me getting a wheelchair was freedom from disability.

I think a lot of people who have been trying to keep ambulating at all costs (and those who love them) see wheelchairs as giving up or some kind of death sentence. It sounds like you’ve come to a place where a wheelchair gives you more options, not fewer. I guarantee when your mom and your loved ones see what your chair gives you back that you’ve lost in your everyday mobility, they’ll get it too.

As a young adult when I didn't have friends or a great way to make them I would have appreciated this so much.

**Organize a dinner/night out** at somewhere that is affordable and accessible. It can be somewhere nationwide like Olive Garden or it can be somewhere one-of-a-kind and local to your town. To make this really successful and truly social disabled people need to have the ability to sit with each other and not necessarily with only their parents or caregivers.

**Movie night.** Rent out a theater for the night or better yet a school gymnasium (more accessibility) or find out how to set this up outside in a park. And show a movie. Make lots of popcorn.  

**Make art.** Host an adaptive art session. Painting is super popular.

Maybe do smaller things like coffee shop meet-ups.

Or take advantage of local events like street fairs, festivals, county/state fairs or whatever you already have going on in your community to meet-up at and enjoy together.

It's pretty standard to also have holiday dances. Or to meet-up at a mall or shopping area to shop for holiday gifts for family, friends and loved ones. It would also be great if you could find a place to meet up again later that day to wrap those gifts.

A book club may also be enjoyed by some folks.

This last bit is kind of a reminder, developmental disability is a wide range of disabilities (even though there are specific criteria to fit the label) and while intellectual disability is a developmental disability not all people with developmental disabilities have intellectual disability or even a learning  disability. Be inclusive of all people with developmental disability be careful to not solely cater to only people with intellectual disability or you'll find yourself alienating a whole group of people.

Sorry, I didn't include much for kids. I am at a time in my life where I feel really out of touch with kids. I did briefly think of video games with a bunch of those new adaptive controllers but that may be really expensive.

Some people will consider their symptoms mild, some people will be absolutely debilitated. It's caused by a defect in collagen and collagen is found everywhere in the body, so a lot of different systems are affected. For example, someone with EDS may be prone to falling because of joint instability, which causes more issues because they have fragile skin and bleed easily because their vascular system is also fragile. Another person may find standing and walking painful because their knees and hips are hypermobile. Both of these people may require disabled parking. ",,,1,0,0,

I really appreciate your whole comment, it was really validating for me. I did get the whole ""you're ruining your child"" thing but he said, ""he has so much potential and you're going to prevent him from reaching it"". I was stunned, I didn't even know what to say. Because from my angle I was telling this doctor that HE was going to prevent my son from being who he is and all that he is capable of being with this push for ABA. 

I got very lucky though, I was able to get his school to listen to me. It's a cross between homeschool and public school, it's funded by the district and we use their curriculum but we do it primarily at home. They finally were able to give us an IEP and the district psychologist is willing to work with him, which is what I think he needs. He has some trauma that I needs to be addressed and the doctor is preventing that work from happening. It's a whole mess but suffice to say things are really looking up.

I don't see the word ""committed"" as accusatory. It's simply about intent.

When a person commits a crime, commits suicide, or commits murder, someone is making a choice.

Death is not the intention of a heart attack, drug useage, illness, or an accident. It is a side-effect.

(That being said, if a person overdoses with the intention of killing him or herself, then I do think the term ""committed suicide"" is more than appropriate.)

I know things are different in America (I'm gussing you're in the US) but if you can get an assessment with someone who is able to correctly fit you for a chair and help/advise you to work out what will work best in your situation. While I was waiting for my customised chair (which was delayed due to insurance issues) I managed to find a secondhand one in good condition online for a $500AUD. So even if you dont buy new its possible to get a lightweight chair for a reasonable price. Ex demo chairs are also usually cheaper than RRP if $$ is an issue.

I know my first few trips out with one of the bulky hospital style chairs were great but when I got a lighter customised chair it was amazing how much more comfortable and maneuverable I was.

Your child is 9, you have a long time for him to reach his potential. Spending money on things that will help him do that would be a much better use of your savings.

At the age of nine or 10 my own son was just getting diagnosed with an autism disorder. We were thinking about plans for how he would be taken care of when we were no longer here to keep a roof over his head and food in his belly. He had a lot of issues related to his autism.

What is harder is people who know but don't understand. My dad knows about all my diagnoses but still doesn't understand how it impacts my life; at the very least, he's not very understanding. 

I don't know if this is an option, but if you have some ground work laid of limitations that people know you have, telling them your diagnosis isn't that big of a step. I feel like its pretty natural for me to hide any symptoms I have when someone doesn't know about my conditions, so I could see why people might not know much. Being vulnerable when people don't know why your acting that way feels unnatural, but makes telling someone about your diagnosis much easier. If you could casually bring up how some of your symptoms affect you, you may even be asked ""why?"", ""What's wrong?"" ""Have you ever talked to your doctor about that?"" which would make sharing your diagnosis easier. 

Take all of this with a grain of salt. I have no idea if any of this will work in your circumstances. Regardless, I wish you the best.",,,1,0,0,

No interior paint specifically in mind. 

Match the paint color to the color of the plaster. You will need to strip/sand the lower part of the wall of older layers of differently colored paint. Else scuff marks will show inner paint layers around the edges like a jaw-breaker licked more on one side.

If the scruff marks are being left by your push-rims/tires then you'll need to paint walls to match the color of the marks themselves, not the nicks exposing the plaster.

How about stapling a length of thin foam or rubber mat like a yoga mat. Plenty of color options available and possibly decorative prints too

I was just trying to talk to my best friend about this, but he's woefully straight and his issues are genetic so coming out was more like a ""me too"" kind of deal so he didn't get it. You're spot on about the anxiety being the same as coming out as queer - I actually get more nervous about coming out as disabled than I do about coming out as queer. I may have an invisible illness, but there's no hiding the gay on this bitch. I tell people I'm queer and they're just like ""Yeah, we got that."" 

That's the main difference I think, with one I'm saying ""This is how I've always been and nothing has changed,"" and I think that's easier to hear. But coming out as disabled - especially to people who knew me before I got sick - is saying nearly the opposite. ""Something has changed, and now I use a different rule book."" 

And on some level, you're informing them of a loss. No matter how positively I try to frame my disabilities, people see it as a Bad Thing that happened to me. Luckily, in my family and with the people I tend to know, it's generally accepted that being queer isn't a Bad Thing so social contracts usually make sure people respond at least politely. This is no such social contract in place around disability. The nicest thing people say is, ""I'm sorry."" And if everyone told me how sorry they were that I was queer, I probably wouldn't be nearly as loud about it as I am. 

The nice part is, boiled down at their essence, coming out is the same whether you're queer or disabled or both: people might treat you differently as a result, and if that happens you will be fine. If you've done this before then your family has already passed the first test, and that should be a comfort. I mean, if they don't care that you're queer they'll probably be cool with disability, right? 

I think you should mention to your mom that you've been using mobility devices. I know that if my mom learned something like that on social media it would really hurt her feelings. But I don't think you need to post an exhaustive medical history to ""explain"" things, you don't owe anyone an explanation. Personally, I'm extremely tight-lipped about my medical stuff. People can know I'm crippled because I rock my purple cane, but I don't need them knowing the details. People do ask why I need the cane or my wheelchair, and I have a brief but informative response: ""I have an autoimmune disease that makes me sick sometimes."" If I like you and we've been friends a while, I might tell you that autoimmune diseases are pack animals so I have a few, and you might learn some of their names. Beyond that, I find discussing my health - especially with reasonably healthy people - absolutely exhausting so I don't it. I get tired of the emotional labor around trying to make other people feel better about how shitty I feel all the time. I have no patience for it, it's not my job, and it's not their business. My best friend is disabled too and I'll talk to him about everything. My husband comes with me to doctor's appointments, he knows everything too. I don't need anyone else knowing my business.

People don't need those details. If you want to walk the children through nature and spread awareness about your condition, that's great. But you certainly don't have to. Coming out can be as simple as introducing your cane to your social media and saying that it helps you manage some issues and to expect to see it featured in upcoming selfies. ",,,3,0,0,

Whether it was my lawyer, other disability/SSI/SSDI forums around the web, doctors, etc. one thing seems to be pretty constant is the unfair nature of the disability system in the US (I’m not saying it’s not unfair in other areas I’m just unfamiliar with programs outside the US). Even with proper evidence it can be readily dismissed from the slightest amount of even subjective evidence. I spoke with a recently retired disability adjudicator recently and he agreed that they were told to use just about any means necessary to find the person able to work despite the unequal comparison in work to daily functionality as you mention. For instance, I told him when I still had a FB that my profile picture was me and my SO at a park just sitting there and I changed it to a generic internet picture before closing down FB completely and he said they could have used that against me making it sound like because I was outside sitting on a bench smiling with my SO pointed out I was able enough to have a relationship, get to the park, sit down and stand up on command, and more theoretic statements that could have thrown my entire case away. Mind you I assume that is worse case, but I’m glad I got off of FB for more reasons than one, but where are we safe? One of the things I suffer from is PTSD and paranoia and I’m already an agoraphobe so when I finally build the strength to go with my SO grocery shopping I’m afraid someone is going to snap a picture of me pushing a grocery cart and claim I can do warehouse work for 8 hours a day like they did with my last case despite my documented medical evidence of severe mobility problems except last case they didn’t have any evidence to the contrary they just claimed all my medical evidence held little weight despite the overwhelming amount of medical professionals that claimed otherwise. In the last ALJ’s report from years back they claimed that because I attended my appointments consistently meant I wasn’t that disabled and then went on to say the ones I missed meant I wasn’t dedicated to my medical treatment.

If I answer “I hurt everywhere” or “I feel like there’s a giant weight on my chest/body and just want to sit here and cry” then they don’t know how to respond. Even the “hope you feel better” feels like empty platitudes which I would rather just not be said. Please don’t ask for pleasantries or “how are you feeling today” then after I tell you end with “hope you feel better” because that just makes it that much worse. It isn’t going to get better. It might vary from day to day but it always hurts. Feels 1000 times worse when it’s someone especially close to the situation and knows the full history and still throws that out there. It’s like me asking “how was your day?” Knowing that you hate talking about your job because of the difficulties of the cases and the desire to help people can be downright depressing when that help arrives a day late and you find out about it. So I don’t ask that anymore and when I get asked how do you feel or how’s it going, I lie or answer generically while hurting inside because I seem to be the one that recognizes that a change is in order. 

I’m always anxious too. I’m self conscious about it. I can’t even be in a crowded room for more than 30 seconds before I bolt to a quiet one (did that today and no one noticed I wasn’t in the crowded room for over an hour so yeah that just made me feel special or like my opinion or company was wanted right there). My husband kept asking me if anything was wrong on the way home. No nothing was because I’m not going to change and I’m not going to put myself into a crowded room to please others. Yes it makes me feel lonely and bothers me but at the same time the sense of dread and feeling trapped in a small room plus anxiety overall with panic attack isn’t welcome in comparison. I didn’t want to say that I was in the other room because I didn’t feel welcome in the other one because the way the crowd is situated into the room puts too many people in a very small space. Not my thing and certainly didn’t want to sound like I was a whiner over something so small. It wasn’t something we were hosting nor a party in my honor so it’s not like I should have any expectations of spending time with anyone.

I had so little information about disability before I became an examiner, and I had no idea how the system worked and I wish that there was more good information readily available for people looking to apply. 

I always try to tell my claimants who seem confused about what exactly Social Security Disability is this sentence.  ""To qualify you must have an impairment, or a combination of impairments that result in the ability to sustain ANY work for a period of greater than a year or will result in death"". 

People get confused on the ANY work and lasting for greater than a year part. 

Under a certain age it is very easy to state that a claimant is capable of sedentary, unskilled, simple work.

For mental impairments, your ability to function has to be extremely affected.

https://www.ssa.gov/disability/professionals/bluebook/AdultListings.htm

That website is an examiners and doctors guidebook to determine disability. It's totally available to anyone!

I would never presume to  know the level of your medical and mental issues so I cannot speak on if or if you do not qualify.

If you do feel like applying I can tell you this, make sure you are seeking treatment for all of your issues. That you are going to doctors appointments and are compliant with all of your medication.

Coach was horrified, I just thought it was funny. When I stop running I get extreme tremors and go into a zombie walk. Here I am doing the zombie walk, bloody hands, blood all over the front of my shirt. I wonder why no one stopped to assist us! ha! 

Chin stitched up, a little sore, but just felt so wonderful to have had such a great day (swim, box, run). 

My wife thinks I am crazy for pushing it, but we just need to get out there and keep moving! I probably overdid it, today is a rest day!

If you're not having gas, and instead are receiving IV medication alone, I'll tell you what that's like too. I've been put under a LOT over the last two decades, and that summary is great for gas.


Here's honestly the WORST you might feel unless you're allergic or something. If they have you in the procedure room before putting you out, you'll feel the normal IV sensations and then (again, this is the WORST case for normal reactions) a steep burning that'll last for a moment or two.

That said, you might not even remember being put out. A lot of the time, you may here a phrase like ""We're going to give you something to relax you a little first"" and that's probably one of the last moments you'll remember. It's a pretty quick transition, unlike with the gas.

Your level of need of a reliable place to sit is just as high and valid as someone who needs that spot to sit because of their hip replacement/clubbed foot/arthritis whatever someone might have going on that they need to sit in the disabled seats. PTSD is unfortunately seen as something lesser than physical disabilities and being that I deal with both on a daily basis (literally had a panic attack at the dentist today rip) I absolutely feel your pain with not wanting to suffer through something triggering like that practically on the daily.  


It should definitely be something you discuss with your therapist at some point if you have the time, but that's also entirely up to you. There's probably going to be people who will bitch at you for using the seat but explain that your medical history is not for public consumption or determination if you are disabled or not.

I am not sure where you live, but here are some of my thoughts: 
Reasonable accommodation must be met, per the ADA, but they do not really specify. Since this HR person is not quite compassionate enough - go above them. I do not understand corporate culture in financing this cubicle situation when the office is so sparse. You need to go higher than this HR person. You need to find someone who understands how insane this idea even is... You need whomever keeps HR in check. A very large company will have someone. Either HR's manager or even a CEO. Many places have an open door policy. You just need to keep knocking on doors until someone listens to reason. 
You will have to state how you are saving the company money by using an already vacant office. Higher ups love their bottom line. State that should the time come that the office is to be filled, you would be absolutely willing to make the adjustment to a cube, when that time comes. You simply thought you were saving the company money and it was working well with your disability. As you have had great reviews, you just want to remain a great employee. 
I have learned that company's are usually worried about 1) their bottom line 2) keeping good employees and 3) anything that screws those up. 
Just keep knocking on doors. You may tick off this HR person, but to be frank.... any HR person that acts like this over a vacant office clearly does not get human resources. 
The HR person from my last job... she mysteriously left two weeks after I was terminated. Hmm.

Etsy has opened up the door for lots of folks to create and sell things.

eBay has shifted, but with a niche understanding of markets, you could hit up a half dozen garage sells and look for things to resell.  Flea markets are well picked over, so unless you know what an OEM 57 Ford item is, pass on those. Still finding things at a garage sale for $5 and selling via eBay for $20 won't make you rich, but 10 a week can help pay the bills.   Hint: older neighborhoods, estate sells, people downsizing we don't want to put things in the trash (sentimental value) but I'd rather SPLIT proceeds with someone selling on ebay. So $100 item, $20 for listing, $80 gross means I would have $40.   I just don't have time/energy to list myself.  Sadly EAPG that I paid $80 for today goes around $20. I still have hundreds of pieces. 

Ship from home USPS Priority. Print labels at home. Postal Service picks up from home. Free shipping boxes (bubble wrap from Costco). This allows for ease of doing things, but you still need to spend time photographing, listing, packing, and getting things shipped.

I am not a health care professional, but from my experience with and lay understanding of anxiety disorders, for some people with anxiety disorders leaving the home or familiar surroundings potentially risks triggering very severe symptoms or exacerbating symptoms.

Above and beyond these general potential medical considerations, it is your friend’s life, and you should respect her decisions, her autonomy and her right to choose how she would like to live her life. If you are concerned about her, please talk to her about your concerns but listen to and accept what she wants.

That said, you can attend school or take classes and receive Social Security disability benefits (SSDI/SSI). In the absence of other significant medical evidence of conditions and work related limitations, substantial, unassisted and successful participation in educational programs can be construed as evidence of ability to perform work related activities and thus could potentially negatively impact a continuing disability review. By their rules, SSA also should consider any help, assistance, or limitations in scheduling or courseload that people with disabilities may use in order to be able to participate in educational programs as affirmative evidence of continuing disability.  For example, sometimes records from a program for students with disabilities can be helpful evidence in Social Security disability cases. Being in school doesn’t necessarily impact your eligibility for Social Security disability benefits, but depending on other factors it can potentially help or hurt a claim for benefits or a review for continuing benefits. 

Additionally, there are some public universities and community colleges who offer online courses. I recommend avoiding online courses from for-profit schools due to the current lack of quality control and current inadequacy of consumer rights for students at for-profit online schools.",,,1,0,0,

We added electrolyte drops to her daily water and increase it on infusion days.  It made a massive difference in how well she handles the infusions. She doesn't even need the decadron shots anymore as benadryl is sufficent.  The brand we use is Hi-lyte.  It may be of some help to you as well.

c52d51b9-5c84-421d-93a7-69936ae578f9,1551555069,"If you live in the US you might be eligible for Social Security disability benefits. To qualify for SSDI, the non medical eligibility criteria is based on your work history and if you paid enough into the system in the past 10 years or so to be insured. If you have very low income and very low resources (under $2000 in liquid assets for individuals), you might meet the non medical eligibility criteria for Supplemental Security Income, SSI.

If your conditions prevent you from working and earning consistently around $1220 per month and have lasted or are expected to last for 12 months or more, then you might meet the medical eligibility criteria for Social Security disability benefits. Social Security disability cases are largely decided based on medical evidence, evidence from doctors and other treating or examining sources, about your conditions and work related limitations. For psychological conditions, evidence of past as well as recent and ongoing treatment from psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists or other mental health care providers is generally very helpful.

If you have a doctor who you have seen on numerous occasions and is available to provide additional information information about your conditions and work related limitations to SSA, that is generally very helpful. As long as it is generally consistent with their treatment notes and other evidence, your doctor’s opinion should be given significant consideration by SSA under their rules. 

The process for obtaining Social Security disability benefits, from my experience in my opinion, tends to be neither fair nor fast. Initial decisions can take between 3-9 months from the date of application and if denials are received, appeals can take years. Having a good treatment provider (such as a psychiatrist or therapist) available to provide additional information to support your case is often a solid way to increase your chances of obtaining a good outcome sooner rather than later.

If you find a cane you like, look for one that is a little too tall. What you are particularly looking for is something that you can lean on with your elbow gently bent (too straight and my arm has a tendency to get tired) without causing your waist or upper body to be bent in the process. as this tended to make my hips and lower back swell. (So, this is more based on these stresses causing more flare-ups, but using this as a basis as it was the prolonged physical stress trigging these particular ones, so it was somewhat of an instant-feedback test of how I should stand when the foot or knee swells up.)

I take it as an exercise, as you are trying to shake the habit (at least I have) in using the cane to take the leg's work completely and giving it to the arm. Instead, your leg (if capable) still is useful in balance, while the other leg takes most of the work, and the uper body assist in the rest. 

I think the hunched position is supposed to help with this, but I never had much luck...

I am mildly passionate about canes. Especially as should something happen, it can be incredibly versatile and useful as a defensive weapon. Having felt vulnerable and generally paranoid as a bullied kid growing into a hobbling adult, a cane was rather good in just making me feel more in control of a situation that won't (hopefully) happen.

When I was a young uniform officer around 80 or 81 I saw a van pull up to the rear of a Montgomery Ward and a couple parked in a handicap spot and exited for the store.  Neither looked over 40-45 but to me they still looked old compared to me.  Now I'd give my left nut to go back to that age.  I asked him why he parked there as he appeared to be walking fine to me.  He immediately ripped open his shirt and showed me a scar that ran nearly from his belly button up to his breast line.  He lit into me that he nearly died from his open heart surgery and has barely recovered more than enough to walk minutes at a time.  He then asked if ""George"" was working.  When I looked at him with a confused look he said George blah blah.  This was the chief of police.  Oh great.  I've pissed off the chief of police in my early stage of my career.  When I apologized and told him we were told to keep and eye closely on handicap spots and look into those abusing the right to use the spots.  (family members and so on)  He calmed down and actually thanked me as he knew there was a problem there and had been for some time.  Whew.  Crisis averted and lesson learned.  No more ASSuming anything like this for me.  Now at 60 I have a perm placard due to many issues with my feet and legs that will never get better and like you I try not to use the spaces unless it's a long walk for me.
Second:  Call the station and ask to speak with someone in the commander level.  Do not settle for a Sgt.  Ask for at least a Lt or Capt.  Be professional and use the tone you're calling in hopes you'll learn more about the local law and also to teach them in the event they are wrong.  (I'll wager the officer is wrong on both the tags and TX plates issue but I do not live there so I do not know.)  Police officers have so many laws to enforce yet there is no way to memorize or learn them all and often I had to research some to make sure I was right.  Hopefully if the officer was wrong this commander level supervisor can make it a roll call training situation in hopes of rectifying the situation.  ",,,17,0,0,

No matter what level of 'functioning; we have, a good majority of people struggle to engage with us authentically, which may push us to isolate ourselves. Like others have said, therapy is a good suggestion, but even that requires resiliency. 

As someone who knows quite a few other folks with disabilities (CP and otherwise) I've seen this failure to launch both first and secondhand. I understand it even as it deeply saddens and angers me, because I know that so many of us become the agents of our own destruction as we internalize the way the world sees us--and worse, the way we think it does.

At some point, you may need to take the same tough love approach that many other parents, regardless of disability, take. Give her an ultimatum, or at least a basic timeline (for my parents it was a year after I graduated, but thankfully that;s been amended to a year after I find a steady job)

Wow, we need more parents like you!! That's awesome.

And yea it sucks how they make parents feel like ABA is the ONLY hope. That doctor should lose his license, seriously. Ugh. I'm so sorry you had to deal with that!

I'm in a group that's specifically for parents trying to get their autistic kids (often autistic daughters) diagnosed and get support for them in school, and it's so hard! I've seen a lot of posts like this (and luckily, a few posts from parents who recently found out their kid was autistic and wanted to ask autistic people about ABA - it seems like the understanding that ABA is harmful might be getting a little more common in parent circles at least, as parents seem to be coming to us sooner).

You are definitely not a shit mom! There are parents out there who (unfortunately) wait after a year or two years before understanding that most ""autism professionals"" (especially proponents of ABA) have no idea what they're talking about! And then they feel horrible about it.

I really wish we could somehow get to doctors to stop the cycle of pathologizing diagnosis by doctor -&gt; scared parent -&gt; peddling ABA therapist tells scared parent to do ABA -&gt; scared parent thinks it isn't right, but isn't sure what to do about it, because professionals are professionals.

I've heard some terrible things said to parents when they quit ABA just like you're talking about. They basically say you're ""ruining your child"" by taking them out of ABA. Ugh, just so absurd.

And then you have moms who later on find out they're also autistic too but weren't ever diagnosed, or they were even misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder, or borderline personality disorder, or depression, and were treated for something they didn't have at all. 

You are very much NOT a shit mom! You sound like an amazingly supportive mom! Honestly I'm quite impressed. ^_^


Oh and just to let you know how right you were about ABA being bad - it was created by the same man who made conversion therapy (Dr. Lovaas). It's basically the same thing, unfortunately. And somehow ABA therapists leave out this information.. wonder why.. :P",,,2,0,0,

I agree with you about capitalism, that seems to be the root of the concept that people who work the hardest and the longest hours are 'the best,' but only really if they are rich. Like you alluded to, if they are poor they still get shamed despite working hard as if they are somehow at fault that their employer exploits them by not paying them a living wage. It struck me as also being part of ableism because people with health conditions and disabilities are unable to actually do this kind of work, so it's a virtue they are automatically disqualified from being able to achieve, if that makes sense.

I also agree about the jealousy that is created in this system. It feels like a divide and conquer system were only the rich benefit whilst the poor fight about who is most deserving. I think your phrase 'overworking being sold as an admirable virtue' is a good phrase that sums it all up.",,,1,0,0,

First, just to let you know, the start of care (intake) is EXTREMELY long and thorough. We get into your entire medical history, basically since birth. It’s a Medicare standard. We really are required to ask when your diagnosis was. 

If your autism effects you with cognitive processing, we’d refer you to speech to work with that. If it’s more ADL stuff, OT will work with you on that. 

As far as aides go, that varies from agency to agency, but the way it works for us is that the aide is just a stop-gap to make sure you’re showered and dressed a couple days out of the week for 2-3 weeks until you can find your own home health aide provider. It isn’t something Medicare will pay for long term. The hope is that by the end of the 2-3 weeks either you’ll have your own aide, or OT will have gotten you far enough along that you’re safe and independent with showering/dressing. 

The social worker is the one who will help you find community resources (like an aide to help with ADLs, or a food service organization like meals on wheels, or whatever it is you need) that fits within your budget.

What we have to consider is the difference between a ""disability"" and having the symptoms of the disability causing impairments or limitations. It sounds like you have a good treatment plan, so your disability doesn't cause many issues related to that.

Your psychiatrist is absolutely wrong with saying you'll have trouble getting jobs in the public sector (federal or state government). The federal government uses a hiring authority (Schedule A) which locates qualified applicants with disabilities and puts them through a non-competitive hiring process (i.e. makes it easier to get hired). Many state governments also have initiatives to hire neurodiverse applicants. Remember, the ADA protects you from discrimination in the workforce.

Inspiration porn tells able bodied people disabled people only matter or have value when they are on the high end of functioning and ability. It also causes able bodied people to assume all disable people are capable of doing anything they put their mind to, and if they aren't they are just lazy.

If you happen to have very low income and resources, there might be legal aid agencies in your area available to provide representation.

Having a doctor who you have seen on numerous occasions and is available to provide additional information about your conditions and work related limitations is generally very helpful. As long as it is generally consistent with their own treatment notes and other evidence, your doctor’s opinion should be given significant consideration by SSA under their rules.  

There are various form or questionnaires for specific conditions or types of limitations that attorneys have and there are a couple ok ones available online as well (I do not generally recommend most online information from sources other than SSA, I could try to find a specific recommendation upon request). The Nolo Press guide on Social Security disability for example includes some decent questionnaires for doctors and their guide is available at most public libraries.

2) Rheumatologists (yes, I saw you're having problems seeing one) sometimes diagnose  things like fibro by ruling everything else out.

3) If you're in the US (or parts of Canada), an employer is NOT allowed to ask for a diagnosis of anything specific about your health if they are asked to make an accommodation.  The most they can do is require you to get a doctor to fill out and sign a form that specifies the requirements of a job and whether you can perform them. Most places don't bother and assume you're not lying.

Examples might be: Able to live more than NN lbs; can sit at desk for multiple hours in a day; can walk 1000 feet without difficulty; can climb stairs; etc.  

What they require will depend on the job, and even then, to deny you the accommodation they have to show that it would impact the company somehow.

For example, say that you use a wheelchair.  If you apply for a job where once a month you're required to walk down stairs, it's generally reasonable for them to trade out that part of the job for something you can do while using a wheelchair. 

On the other hand, if you use a wheelchair and apply for a job that would require you to regularly lift 30 lb items from a high shelf, they would be within their rights to refuse an accommodation.",,,1,0,0,

I am bothered by lame, spastic/spazz, retarded and as noted in my flair ""special needs"". It honestly makes me feel a little sick inside and I die a little bit when I hear, ""she is special needs."" We're not even worth proper English. It's gross.

I was very much person first for nearly two decades. Now, I describe myself as disabled when it is the topic.

I think if you can have a sit down conversation with your Mom, which I do realize she is a plane ride away, it will help. You need to somehow tap into that Motherly compassion. You know your Mom best. When you have doctors and even disability saying you cannot do certain things - they don't just hand out disability. Also, as a pet parent, I don't understand just leaving the dogs in the one house for half the year. I mean, that's kind of I don't want to say irresponsible... but it just doesn't sound good for the sake of the house or the dogs to just have someone who will only pet sit. They need more than that. They will not understand and they will have broken hearts. :(

c52d51b9-5c84-421d-93a7-69936ae578f9,1553127644,"To be eligible for disability benefits through SSA you need to meet their definition of disability and to meet the non medical eligibility requirements for their programs.

SSA generally defines disability as unable to perform substantial work due to limitations from medical conditions that have lasted or are expected to last for 12 months or more. The determination of disability is largely based on medical evidence.

In addition to being found disabled under their rules, there is non medical eligibility criteria for different disability benefits programs administered by SSA.

You might be eligible for Social Security disability insurance, if you have worked and payed into Social Security.  SSA has special rules that lets younger workers achieve insured status with less work history than is generally required for older workers to be insured for SSDI.

Also, you might be eligible to be insured based on the record of a parent, if you are found to be disabled under SSA rules prior to age 22, and if you have a parent who is insured under SSA and is currently collecting Social Security disability or retirement benefits or who is deceased. See this for general information about disabled adult child benefits [https://www.ssa.gov/planners/disability/qualify.html#anchor7](https://www.ssa.gov/planners/disability/qualify.html#anchor7).

If you have very low income and very low resources you might qualify for SSI. Here is some general information about SSI eligibility. [https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-eligibility-ussi.htm](https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-eligibility-ussi.htm). There are social services and non profit programs in California that might be able to help you in applying for benefits if you have a very low income. Your county’s social services agency or your health care provider may be able to provide you with referrals for help.

i was sorry to read about your experience and it made me think.  

The nutshell version is:
- i was previously studying at a major university and registered with their disability unit
- it was no walk in the park!
- each and every adjustment, where possible, had to be individually negotiated
- academics in my experience had widely varying attitudes 
- nor was it cut and dry, by which i mean for example, some professionals with visible disability exhibited a ""suck it up"" approach

overall points here include 
a) no consistency of approach.. individual academics decided hugely variable different things
b) rather than a single assessment process, with a relatively straightforward application in practice, as offered by the smaller, more modest non-tertiary educational facility I'd attended beforehand,  it was a complex and constant process
c) upshot being required processes to navigate any ""extension"" consumed far more time and energy than any allowance actually granted

some academics were kind and encouraging. i never forgot the following experience however

For a particular subject,  as was not uncommon,  having lost time throughout,  i no choice in the end but to apply for extension in order to be physically and cognitively able to complete the major final assignment paper. 

This involved specific medical documentation, much negotiation etc

in the end, the relevant professor had accepted the medical stuff and granted a minimal extension which i abided by - keeping in mind the time and energy the required proof and negotiation involved to go through said process. Completed assignment while still very unwell,  knowing it was not my best work.   

Paper was then returned to me with a high mark downgraded to a much lower mark. This turned out to be a specific penalty because it was ""late"", despite the negotiation, which was in writing.

The shock came, this being from memory,  when that proof of extension didn't seem to matter. Any assistance from the disabilities unit was limited to simply asking him about it. He upheld his decision, and they said they could not intervene further per policy. 

i was bewildered, didn't see how it was possible, given he had granted it in writing.  

There may be particularities eg policies of institution. In my situation there was an appeal mechanism, perhaps through an ""equity"" unit. i had to  prepare a submission and appear before a committee of three people including a student member to plead my case. That was the only option open to me i knew of. 

The good news is the appeal was ""successful"". No one from said committee could deny the fact he had granted the extension in writing. The actual process was minor. They looked at his email and i was relieved of his imposed penalty.

However,  while the consequences for him appeared to be zero. Altgough in the end i simply received the original mark with no academic penalty - i felt otherwise penalised. All of that time and effort to do the right thing. Then having to go through an appeal just to break even.  

i can't explain how stressful it was.  Although there was an appeal mechanism, i guess the experience disillusioned me about professional standards regarding disability in the academy. i got really, really stressed about his arbitrary decision and leading up to the appeal. Academically,  i felt condemned.  

i guess from his point of view i had extra time and could spend that improving my work,  which was unfair to other students. 

But it wasn't extra time in that respect. Far from it,  i had lost much more time than a brief extension offered.  A modicum of time to complete work was a minimum, really in order to not fail. That minimum still didn't in my view allow me to operate at an academic standard i could forseeably achieve if not struggling with the effects of ongoing medical conditions and disability. It wasn't any sort of advantage. 

Therefore i felt he was able to effectively penalise me for a negotiated reasonable adjustment, if only by virtue of the fact that i was pushed into a lengthy stressful process despite the fact of the proof in writing, just to protect my overall grade. In the meantime,  there seemed to be no consequences for him doing so. As such,  i lost certain faith in the academy as a place of enlightened values,  as well as its disability provisions.

it sounds like you're already very self aware and cognizant of how this group impacts you and others mentally.  its easy to infer from your words you're incredibly passionate about making life better for the people affected by your condition. 

i would wager that in recent history this support group and the work you've done for it is as big a part of your current identity than the condition itself. but you're getting burnt out. It doesn't sound like you run a support group. It sounds like you *are* the support group. 

i think you just need to step back a little. You've unintentionally fallen into responsibility of something that can't be done by any one person. Support groups are great but sometimes become these echo chambers of negativity and despair.  We often ignore or dismiss opportunities to talk to others about our conditions - they dont understand, they ask dumb questions, make even dumber suggestions, its just always awkward. Luckily, we have a group of people online who will understand! Obviously I understand the immense value and utility of groups, but it's a common problem.


first, make a post and say what you said here. you're honored but exhausted and need help. Give specifics as to what you need help with. i.e.  ""There's an event in Queensland Australia and we need people to volunteer/speak/just be present.""

Try to work from the bottom up and get people engaged at every level of your community. Make posts that asks a question that's answer isnt ""yes"" or ""no"". Try getting them to explain how they would fix ____(some physiological, cultural or legislative issue concerning your disability)  if they had all the resources they need. Many people(s) will realize something they *can* do while trying to think of an answer. 

Encourage people to apply for moderator positions on the forums and such. Often if you pique someones interest you can get them involved. Post a banner or flyer contest. You'll probably get 40 posts of clipart and MSPaint but I guarantee you there's going to be at least one person who says ""oh i got this"" and will boot up photoshop. Have video competitions  too.


obviously these things are also work. hopefully you can sow the seeds. since its so rare i would see if there are any ""umbrella"" organizations (i.e. a group that covers rare pulmonary conditions) that are relevant. i think this would probably be the only way you'd see significant top heavy change.

at the end of the day though, what do you want to do? If this makes you happy, rey and work through it. it sometimes you **have** to step away. sometimes you have to stay away. i dont need to know a single detail about you to know that you have absolutely improved the lives of every individual with your condition. 

ive been in a similar role and it's difficult to let something like that go, especially when you seem to be the sole reason its still/ever was there. Its easy to feel like you're ""letting them down"", or that nobody else is fighting for them. Try to step back. Try to hand over the reigns. Communicate though. If people still arent engaging then you might just have to be blunt and tell them you can't do it any longer.  You've done so much more than was ever asked, don't let farcical guilt slip in and blame you for their inaction at that stage.

All three of those things applied to me last year (I reported my income monthly like I was supposed to, and they just kept paying), so I wound up having to pay back over $10,000. That's a big number! But that number comes from how much EXTRA they gave me. It wasn't some out-of-the-blue thing, it was totally predictable and all I had to do was NOT spend the money they were paying me when they weren't supposed to pay me.

Haha that's a great one!!! So I grew up in Catholic school. not because my parents were overly religious but because they wanted me to be in private school so that if we moved I wouldn't have to change school districts and make friends all over again. Catholic school was the least expensive of the private school options in the city we lived in. 

We actually did have a health class that taught all the basic sexual reproductive functions. I don't recall anybody being super preachy about abstinence but we had a yearly sit down to look at horrific slides of what different STIs did your body and talk about the cons of teen pregnancy. So pretty much what you'd expect from Catholic school. 

I've always been fascinated by sex though so I did plenty of my own research at an early age (13 and up) and my minor in college was women's studies so I took all kinds of classes on sexuality, trans/LGBT, body image, etc. I also used to volunteer as a rape crisis counselor at a local nonprofit.

c52d51b9-5c84-421d-93a7-69936ae578f9,1553377367,"Many people receive both SSDI and SSI.

This often happens when someone is insured under the Social Security disability benefits, but due to relatively modest earnings, if their benefit payment amount is lower than the SSI rate (including the state supplement if any) and they meet the other non medical eligibility for SSI (strict limits on income and assets), they might be eligible for both SSDI and SSI. 

If for example, I am insured for SSDI but my SSDI payment is only $600 per month (and if I meet SSI’s other financial eligibility criteria), I might be able to receive $600 in SSDI and $191 in SSI each month. 

After a $20 disregard for any type of income, there is a dollar for dollar reduction in SSI for unearned income (there are other rules for earned income). If my state does not have a supplemental SSI payment, my maximum eligibility for SSI is the federal rate, $771 in 2019. So if I have no other income, my SSI payment is calculated by $771 (SSI federal maximum)-(SSDI $600-$20 deduction)=$191.

For people receiving both SSDI and SSI, SSA usually consolidates regular monthly payments into one payment date. But when the benefits are just starting for the first month or two, the regular monthly payments may be issued on separate dates. The payments are typically itemized, one payment is SSDI and one for SSI, but after the initial dust settles SSA will usually issue the payment on the same date (or very close, some people may get their SSI on the first of the month then SSDI on third of the month). So following my example above, if I have direct deposit set up, on my bank statement I would see 2 payments from SSA, one for $600 (SSDI) and one for $191 (SSI) and these usually would come through on the same day each month.

Before receiving SSI payments, SSA may want to interview the person to review and update the non medical eligibility criteria, especially if the disability determination took more than a couple months. If this is the case, the person will receive a letter from SSA asking them to come for an interview and bring information or documentation for a financial review. After this financial review, SSA calculates SSI and SSDI payments (including retroactive payments). After the payments are calculated, SSA will send (usually separate) letters itemizing how SSI and SSDI payments and retroactive payments are calculated.

If you are eligible for SSI, SSA may not release all the backpay in one lump sum (depending on how much backpay is owed). They will usually issue retroactive payments in installments of about 3 months worth of retroactive payments every 6 months, and release the remainder (if any) after about 2 years. The SSDI payments are usually included with these SSI installment retroactive payments. (For people receiving SSDI only, the retroactive payments are typically released in one lump sum). 

The time it takes for SSA to calculate and issue retroactive payments (after receiving information they request for you) varies a bit depending on circumstances with your case and local office and other factors. But generally retroactive payments are issued within 3 weeks to 3 months after SSA has the information they need from you. ",,,1,0,0,

From my experience the process tends to be neither fast nor fair. Having an experienced attorney or advocate is usually very helpful. Also if you have a doctor you have seen on numerous occasions and who is available to provide additional information to SSA about your conditions and work related limitations that is generally very helpful. As long as your doctor’s opinion is generally consistent with their treatment notes and other evidence, SSA should give their opinion significant consideration.  If you obtain representation, your attorney should have forms or questionnaires for your doctor/s to fill out. If you are unable to obtain representation at the reconsideration stage, after your case is assigned to a disability examiner, you can request that they send you forms for your doctor to complete.

In terms of how employment impacts your SSI payment amount, by SSA rules you are required to promptly report earnings to SSA.

So for example if I earn $400 this month (March) I am required to report this before the 10th of next month (April) and SSA would reduce the following month’s (May’s) payment by $158 ($400-$85)/2. While my payment would be reduced, I would still come out ahead. See this PDF brochure from SSA about how working while receiving Social Security disability benefits, the rules about SSI start on page 7.  [https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10095.pdf](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10095.pdf) 

If you are consistently earning around or over substantial gainful activity levels ($1220 in 2019) that may impact your continuing medical eligibility for SSI. If your SSI is cut off solely due to excess earnings you might be able to continue receiving Medicaid. 

If you come up for a continuing disability review, in the absence of other significant evidence,  part time work (school, hobbies) can potentially be construed as evidence of ability to perform work related activities and thus potentially negatively impact your continuing medical eligibility. However, they also must consider other evidence, especially medical evidence, of continuing disability and work related limitations limitations due to medical conditions. As long as you have been receiving medical treatment and have a doctor who is available to provide additional information to support your case, that is generally very helpful evidence if and when you get a continuing disability review.

Do you know what agency your case worker is at? If yes, we can try to help you find contact information for that agency. Also if you get therapy or psychiatry services, some health care providers have social workers or case managers who might be able to help with finding affordable housing. 

Also, have you tried contacting Well House? I can’t vouch for them personally but it sounds like they might be a helpful resource. [https://www.wellhousegr.org](https://www.wellhousegr.org)  It sounds like their focus is on shared housing, but given your conditions perhaps they can give you an appropriate accommodation.",,,1,0,0,

People with disabilities are woefully behind as far as representation in the equality movement goes. Even other minorities can't be bothered to include us half the time - if it occurs to them in the first place. Many of us aren't very visible or vocal in society as a result of our disabilities. Many of us are not able to work, pay taxes, and/or we depend on government funds.

Good on you for hanging in there and well done for completing the work you got done. 

another consideration is that in my understanding, academics work with their own deadlines to complete and hand in marking, which might cause some reluctance to be flexible,  depending. (Eg,  this in itself might vary based on what else is competing for their attention at any particular time, a reasonable extension may unfortunately be seen as avoidable delay.)

You were mentioning the dude in head of the course had agreed to flexible deadlines and then ""forgot"". If you have that in writing,  perfect. 

The next step is to find out what policies the place has to resolve disputes. Even if you did not live with disability,  i think it would be unconscionable for the institute to ignore the impact of demonstrated concussion, but most especially in the context of other conditions. 

with regard to law specific to disability, it's hard to offer nuanced and reliable comment.  in short,  though,  the policies which may leave a bad taste in your mouth and not fix the underlying problem may be a better option.  Depending on the laws where you live,  you might be able to raise a complaint without it costing you anything. My suggestion would be to spend time researching it carefully.  For instance,  whether the other party can decline it or walk away from it.  Where i live,  there is a state based and federal based law.  Much about the associated processes are substantially different, including with regard to possible costs. In the meanwhile,  i looked at some published caselaw and was horrified. Ultimately,  some professionals who oversee these areas of law may have approaches that are no more progressive than the professor in question.

That's not to say you lack groundsfor complaint,  or that such laws will be of no assistance.  

Rather,  i have seen some published caselaw with regards to a state based jurisdiction that was indicative of individuals trying to uphold their rights where they believed they had been mistreated by an educational institution and it sucked.  

This could differ wildly in many respects. I'm referring to a specific area,  and a context which looks adversarial where there seems to be an imbalance of power and where institutes have legal advice if not direct representation (where people with disabilities are often representing themselves). 

Often,  it boils down to words like ""reasonable - in the circumstances"". 

Depending how much time,  energy and resilience you have,  you could seek facts to support what might foreseeably be common sense. 

To use an exaggerated example,  a university won't usually grant an extension of say 20 years. If we ask why,  then (besides academic standards) it will turn out that among other things,  it has its own internal processes which are administrative in nature. 

One defence against making reasonable allowances for a person is that to make such an allowance would cause ""unreasonable hardship"". 

So,  from an amateur point of view, one way to support your matter is to see if there's anything in writing - eg published policy - where the professor's conduct is misaligned. 

And also to identify reasoning that demonstrates that by requesting a consideration of a minimal extension, the effects on the way the university functions should not be too onerous for them to handle with courtesy. 

This might mean in turn enquiring about whether they have specific external processes affecting them involving deadlines which would adversely impact them in granting the relief you seek. 

If they can't say yes and give a specific  example which fits with the timing,  then it may strengthen the position the decision is both discretionary and misguided.  

Likewise if there's anything the professor's boss mentioned in writing re flexibility of deadlines, have that to hand. If not,  identify the date. Consider, if you haven't already,  a ""reminder"" in writing. 

With regard to the laughter,  i would be very aggrieved myself,  as i think most people would. 

I don't think you have been ""too emotional"" in describing its impact on you,  however avoiding this approach seems to be a rule of thumb in guidelines on raising complaints. One way to approach this is to move away from the fact it is offensive and to shine a light on the fact is it unprofessional.

This could be very specific.  Eg their policy might refer to a standard, which in turn will use words for expected conduct. Turn to the meaning of those words.  Then relate the feelings caused by the laughter directly to the meaning of the words in the policy/standard. This may help to ""ground"" the complaint. 

Unfortunately often policies seem to be ideals on paper that rarely translate to actual practice,  but those are some ideas to help you give your concerns (which sound valid) some traction.

c52d51b9-5c84-421d-93a7-69936ae578f9,1553207103,"Did you apply for Social Security disability benefits?

If yes, by SSA’s definition of disability includes being unable to perform substantial gainful work in competitive environment. If you are working and earning more that substantial gainful activity levels ($1220 per month in 2019 for non blind individuals), for extended periods (6 months or more), then you may not meet SSAs medical eligibility criteria. 

If your earnings are under those levels, they may construe even modest part time work as evidence of ability to perform more substantial work, unless there is other evidence (particularly medical evidence) to support significant work related limitations due to medical conditions. If you are receiving assistance or accommodations in your workplace, or if you have difficulties performing your job consistently, or if you are unsuccessful in your efforts to hold a job for very long, these factors could be considered as affirmative evidence of disability.

Working, particularly with very modest earnings and limited hours, does not necessarily disqualify you from Social Security disability.  Depending on the other evidence in your case (particularly medical evidence) performing some limited work can be taken as evidence that you are doing as much work as able, and thus support a finding of disability, unable to perform more substantial work. If your earnings are below SGA levels, $1220 per month) the medical evidence in the case will generally be a more significant factor in determining eligibility than the performance of some limited work.",,,2,0,0,

There is no penalty for enrolling in a Medicare Advantage plan during their annual enrollment period. During the open enrollment period you can also buy a Medicare Supplemental plan (Medigap). (You can have either a Medicare Advantage plan or a Medigap plan, but not both). You can also switch plans during the enrollment period and generally avoid penalties as long as your new coverage starts within about 2 months after the old coverage ends.

See this pdf from Medicare about enrollment periods.

The next open enrollment period will be from October 15 2019 to December 7 2019. There are also special enrollment periods if there is a major change in your life or coverage. (i.e. if you move or if you become Medicaid eligible).

If you would like help with choosing plans or weighing your options I strongly recommend consulting with a Medicare health insurance counseling programs, I linked to to a directory elsewhere in this thread.

(Rule Two is: And you can sell them anything.)

It's amazing how people think they have a right to someone's personal life just because they exist.  If it helps at all, I've seen idjits ask personal questions of people of all sorts of abilities.  

If you want, there are a bunch of ways to ""answer"" such an invasive and rude question.

One is to answer it -- but not with what they want. ""Oh, I have a terrible headache today. It must be the weather..."" or ""Nothing!  I'm in a great mood today. I won $25 in the lottery! I'm trying to decide what to spend it on. Maybe..."" etc.   If they're boorish and try to point out that this isn't what they were asking, say, ""As I was saying..."" and go back into your tale of ""what's wrong.""

You could go for the Advice Columnist route: Give them a look of disbelief and reply, ""Why would you ask such a thing?""   If they're really clueless, they'll respond with ""I'm just curious!""  I recommend that you keep asking ""But why would you ask such a thing?""

If you want to get nasty, demand to know something very personal, like, ""So, what's your favorite way to have sex?""  ""Have you had a colonoscopy yet? You really should!"" etc. When they balk at being asked something so personal, ask them why they think they can ask *you* something so personal.

I have heard a lawyer say that actually  on Reddit AMA about disability but I don't know if that is actually factual.

you need to call your local Social Security office and tell them you want to apply for her for SSI, if you dont make too much money, you can go to the next step which is to find out if she medical qualifies for disability.

Given her lack of work experience, she probably has a decent chance.

She's only 30 which is Young for disability but, there are people who are Young &amp; get in the program. I got in easily at 29 because I have permanent, incurable problems.

There's no way to know if she qualifies or not unless you apply.

If your case is pending at the reconsideration stage and if you have a treating doctor who is familiar with your conditions, you can contact the disability examiner assigned to your case and request that they send forms or questionnaires for your doctor/s to fill out.

From my experience the Social Security disability determination process tends to be neither fast nor fair.

The landlord would be fine with someone cleaning and organizing. I just can't physically do it myself. I don't think there are any groups that go around cleaning and organizing homes for the disabled for free. At least I've never heard of that. 

I've made the rounds over and over with every organization I could find until I burnt out. I don't fit the demographics most programs are geared to helping. I don't have kids, I'm not addicted to anything, no one is abusing me, I'm not a minority. The most common response I get is a blank look, a shrug and a referral to yet another office. I go around in circles from one office to another. The woman at public housing explicitly told me I could get on the waiting list but I'd stay right on the bottom since people with minor children have priority. I'm not complaining about that, children need to have a home, just explaining how people like me fall through the cracks. 

The landlord charges me a small (very small) fixed amount as rent because I watch his dogs during the day so he doesn't have to come home midday. I let them outside to pee, feed them if he's going to come late, etc. There's no money to relocate anywhere and I don't know how to get a cheaper deal than what I have now. *All* of my money goes to medical bills. I owe more money in debt than I have to live on in an entire year. Gross as this place sounds, he helps me out a lot with groceries and by floating me small cash loans here and there, for example, I had an urgent care visit last month that I had to pay up front for and he loaned me the cash so I could be seen.

&gt;I've had to live in what I would consider sub-standard living conditions.

The department that handles licencing doesn't care, they handed me my learners permit back before I had a diagnosis and knew this was permanent, My doctor and I are the ones who decide if it's safe or not. In my country there's no database of people that doctors have told ""don't even bother getting a license"" there's only a database of people who have *lost* their license for medical reasons.

The PNES episodes were quickly controlled once my therapist and I identified the root cause and i've been 5 years seizure free.

I was in the backseat of my mother-in-law's car with my partner driving and his mum chatting away about the food and wine at the restaurant we were headed to, His mother then asked ""Hey Deary, You haven't had a fit in years? when are you getting you license? It's such a shame to waste your sobriety on not being our desie"" referring to the fact that I don't drink.

I replied ""The seizures were never the reason I can't drive, I'm not allowed to drive because I can't physically operate a car or see out the window properly"" and his mother replied ""but that's not court ordered or anything right? like you could get your license and just not drive on your bad days""

My partner swooped in with ""Mum, just sitting in a moving car causes her to develop palsies in her legs, how could she possibly operate the pedals"" and her response was ""they make hand controls for people who can't move their legs""

That could be a huge issue, and if he caused an accident, a major liability that you do not want.

I would look into getting the accommodation at work - I was able to take two breaks, as opposed to just one when I wasn't feeling well. I have hypoglycemia.  My manager was happy to give me an extra break or time to eat rather than dealing with the day I went out of work on a stretcher.

Especially in states where medical cannabis is legal, some SSA disability adjudicators (disability determination services and ALJs) informally accept prescribed cannabis as a medical treatment. They are, however, generally bound by federal rules and tend to evaluate cannabis under the same rules for substance use disorders. 

By SSA rules, we must show that our medical conditions are limiting and severe independent of any substance use or abuse. We need to show that substance use disorders are not material to our disabling conditions, meaning that our conditions and limitations are disabling regardless of whether or not we use or abuse substances. See this Social Security ruling that was intended to clarify their policy on evaluating substance use. [https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/rulings/di/01/SSR2013-02-di-01.html](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/rulings/di/01/SSR2013-02-di-01.html) 

For a determination about materiality of substance use disorders, SSA should generally accept the opinion of your doctor as long as your doctor’s opinion is generally consistent with their treatment notes and other evidence. If you doctor has been generally supportive of medical cannabis treatment, or has not advised against using medical cannabis, you could probably expect that your doctor believes that cannabis would not significantly worsen or exacerbated your conditions. If you are unsure about what your doctor thinks, I suggest checking with them. If and when your case come up for a continuing disability review, it is very helpful if your doctor is available to provide additional information to SSA about your conditions and work related limitations.  Generally, as long as your doctors have supported your use of medical cannabis and are available to opine to SSA that cannabis use does not cause or exacerbate your conditions, it should not typically negatively impact a continuing disability review in the future.

""Previously it was considered that CRPS had three stages; it is now believed that people affected by CRPS do not progress through these stages sequentially. These stages may not be time-constrained and could possibly be event-related, such as ground-level falls or re-injuries of previously damaged areas. Thus, rather than a progression of CRPS from bad to worse, it is now thought, instead, that such individuals are likely to have one of the three following types of disease progression:

""Stage"" one is characterized by severe, burning pain at the site of the injury, muscle spasms, joint stiffness, restricted mobility, rapid hair and nail growth, and vasospasm. The vasospasm is that which causes the changes in the color and temperature of the skin. Some may experience hyperhydrosis (increased sweating). In mild cases this stage lasts a few weeks, in which it can subside spontaneously or respond rapidly to treatment (physical therapy, pain specialist).

""Stage"" two is characterized by more intense pain. Swelling spreads, hair growth diminishes, nails become cracked, brittle, grooved and spotty, osteoporosis becomes severe and diffuse, joints thicken, and muscles atrophy.

""Stage"" three is characterized by irreversible changes in the skin and bones, while the pain becomes unyielding and may involve the entire limb. There is marked muscle atrophy, severely limited mobility of the affected area, and flexor tendon contractions (contractions of the muscles and tendons that flex the joints). Occasionally the limb is displaced from its normal position, and marked bone softening and thinning is more dispersed.""

I can't access anything out of a backpack when it's on the back of my chair without a huge struggle and things falling out. I've since discovered 'top opening' backpacks which help, but its still a pain to get my laptop out for class. As a kid it hurt my independence not to be able to access my backpack. Now it's just a pain in the butt.

Anyways, PM me if you wish, but my point is I can't remember anything I struggled with as a kid (physically related to my wheelchair) that I still don't find annoying as an adult. So you might not have to make your potential market so narrow.

If I have to go somewhere far away, somewhere fast, or where I have to bring stuff back (think IKEA), I go with mobility taxi. I get a budget for the mobility taxi monthly paid for as part of my disability budget from the state. As I am a wheelchair user and have a disability 'status' of 100 per cent, my subsidized yearly public transit card is also paid for. When the random controls come through, they see my power chair, greet me , and don't bother checking my pass. I haven't been checked officially since I switched from a push to a power chair.

Buses I flag down with a head nod or shake 'no' when they drive up, and they kneel down, driver pops the ramp, helps me in if I don't have a PA along, I park in the wheelchair bay. Trams drop the lift, hoist me up, I park in the bay. Trains, it depends. Underground is trying to update all their stations to have ramps built-in, those that don't have them yet, I need help from strangers if I don't have a PA with me. Fast trains have ramps that are driven out or manually placed, and I park in a bay. There's a special button on all public transit except Underground trains for me to press and receive assistance to exit the vehicle. Underground you're on your own. I try not to use the Underground without a PA.

464a0b84-9cf6-468e-888a-994835cb3ab3,1552176714,"I'd give a couple types a try, as well types of stances. The two main stance I am aware of is the 'hunch' where you use it more for balance and back, hunching over and using it like a third leg (I HATe this method.) Then there is the House method, one I normally use. Where you instead treat it like a supplement for the hurt leg. You lean on it whenever you put weight on your leg, and it makes it easier for me. 

Then you have the types. Curved is a favorite for the grip, but I like it because I can hook carts and the occasional othger thing that makes sense. Then you have the 'whoopin' cane which has a large ball on the end. Problem with this one, least for me, is that it would put too much pressure on my hand and cause the palm (then the entire hand) to swell up from the disorder. 

There are a few other variant, but playing with just those can be helpful. As well plqaying with cane weight. Practicing a shoulder and back stance is important as otherwise it can cause any of your muscles to cramp, stiffen, or get pulled. Grips for the handle and grips for the bottom (so it doesn't slip on the floor) are also good ways to help make it easier on your arms or legs, as it will help prevent the small muscle twitches and attempts to right yourself.

Simply typing this up incase anyone else was trying out canes and was rather lost. For something unique, look into Spy Shops or Martial Arts stores. There is a group of people who make these notches canes for cane fighting. These notches are also very good for gripping.

I can appreciate the benefit of vestibules now. In the UK, we generally have the same grey weather continuously. Or it's incredibly hot. The winter's, recently, have been rather tame.

I think automated doors are the solution. I believe, in this day and age, it's something any building widely used by the public should implement. I think there is no excuse for businesses or other institutions to ignore this.

There is a HUGE difference between asking how someone manages their life outside of selfcare and admitting you live in absolutely deplorable conditions *with another person that thinks it's perfectly normal to live that way.* (By the way, no judgment-just honesty.)

The truth is, you are living with another person that is very likely never going to change their ways. They clearly do not see it as a problem so why would they?

Also, you giving them rent money is enabling them to continue to live like that.

You aren't going to like reading this but you need to move out. You need to find anything else-if you can find a car to borrow you might be able to find a couch to sleep on or a room in better house to rent.  A typical healthly person should not live in this situation let alone someone with issues. Get on waiting lists for public housing, contact homeless shelters, look outside of your immediate area for these things. Contact organizations in your area and explain your situation. Ask for real help from real people in your community. Don't  just ask for help once from one place, keep doing it.

I've had to live in what I would consider sub-standard living conditions. There were filthy litter boxes, mountains of laundry, piles of dirty dishes and so much clutter, smelly animals, pet hair, fleas and mice. It was still nothing like what you are describing and it mentally exhausted me. I kept the door to my room shut and locked 90% of the time. I also lost my mind.

If a cover for your light is a luxury, you live with lead paint and an obstinate homeowner I cannot offer any advice on how to make your situation more livable. Other then to again insist that moving out is your best course of action.

I wish you all the best.

I hope some one else has more helpful advice.

He is working and does make over $1220 a month.  It sounds like that Step 1 is going to kick him out of being able to get any disability.  

  
So that this mean he shouldn't apply until he really can not work anymore, like leaves his job because of his health issues, and then he can apply?   
He does see a kidney specialist, foot dr, and a eye specialist at the moment.  The eye specialist said he can give my husband a field of vision test, but they give that information to the DMV, and the DMV can restrict his license.  I'm worried to do the test, him lose his license and still have to work.  I know he has no peripheral vision in the left eye after the first  vitrectomy, and I believe once this second eye is fully recovered (he still can't see out of it, takes 2 months to fully recover) this peripheral vision on the right side will be just as bad.

  
Sorry it's been stressful trying to take care of him, and get him all the help he needs.

If you have a doctor who you have seen on numerous occasions and is available to provide additional information information about your conditions and work related limitations to SSA, that is generally very helpful.

c52d51b9-5c84-421d-93a7-69936ae578f9,1551727279,"To be medically eligible for Social Security disability benefits under their rules, you need to show that you are unable to work and earn about $1220 per month due to medical conditions and this has lasted or is expected to last for 12 months or more. These decisions are based largely on medical evidence. But before they even look at medical evidence, at step 1 in their disability determination process, they ask if you are working and earning above $1220 monthly (for non blind individuals). If yes, you are not disabled under their rules, regardless of how grave or debilitating your medical conditions may be. 

To be eligible solely on the basis of blindness, their criteria is if your vision in your better eye cannot be corrected to better than 20/200 or if in your better eye your visual field is 20 degrees or less. If someone with visual impairments does not meet their definition of blindness, SSA consider all medical conditions that limit work related activities.

If you have a doctor, better yet a specialist, who you have seen on numerous occasions and is available to provide additional information about your conditions and work related limitations to SSA, that is generally very helpful. As long as it is generally consistent with their own treatment notes and other evidence, your doctor’s opinion should be given significant consideration by SSA.

If you are struggling at work due to your conditions, one option may be to exercise your rights under the ADA and other disability rights statutes that afford us protections in most workplaces. Some very small businesses may be exempt from certain ADA protections. If you feel that you might benefit from reasonable modifications in your job due to medical impairments, here is some general information about requesting accommodations from the Job Accommodation Network [https://askjan.org/publications/individuals/employee-guide.cfm](https://askjan.org/publications/individuals/employee-guide.cfm). If you need help or support there are disability rights programs in each state that should be available to provide additional information and advocacy help for accommodations at work. See this PDF of disability rights programs in each state. [http://www.ndrn.org/images/Documents/Media/PA_CAP_LIST_2019.pdf](http://www.ndrn.org/images/Documents/Media/PA_CAP_LIST_2019.pdf) ",,,6,0,0,

If you do have a doctor, or health care providers, available to provide additional information, after your CDR is assigned to a disability examiner, you can request that they send you questionnaires or forms for your doctors to fill out.  From my experience this is often a very good way for people who are disabled under SSA rules to get their CDRs favorably resolved sooner rather than later.

Get an Instant Pot and keep in plugged in by your bed. This thing is extremely useful for low-effort but healthy cooking. It's an electronic pressure cooker, and has lots of attachments. 
 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_gJhOCbM3NRP40

My favorite attachments are:

Ceramic double stacking containers. Very versatile, and unlike metal it's safe to store food in the fridge. Put rice on one level, steam vegetables on the other-- or veggies/meat, meat/eggs, whatever. Comes with one lid but if you email them they'll send you a second for free. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079MB25B7/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_3JhOCbJNPP5SN

A ceramic no-stick interior pot. Get a couple, then you can cook again without having to wash the last pot right away. No-stick helps a lot with rice and soups or anything that might burn to the bottom.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ICL8M1I/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_kMhOCbCNYB7Z9

Glass lid, allowing you to put a lid on the ceramic pot and store things like bulk soup or curry without having to transfer to a new dish. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008FUJ2LK/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_WNhOCbYRHVVF6

Besides that, here are some general cooking utensils that helped me out a lot:

A vegetable dicer-- saves time and energy chopping veggies. You still need to cut them into chunks (ex. quartered onions) so they fit in the machine but it makes things really even and much less work. If you kept a hanging basket of veggies by your bed I bet you could do it right there.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HC7BNJA/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_xPhOCbCM02GTH

This super neat device let's you easily cook pasta in the microwave. If you keep a microwave by your bed you can make noodles, but you'd need to either use the noodle water (ex. put it in the instant pot to make broth or steam veggies) or have a bucket or something by the bed to drain the water into. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000YT2XOI/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_PRhOCbJ1HTJ2J

I had a microwave by my bed and didn't use it much except for the occasional popcorn, but I also couldn't afford a mini fridge so I didn't have quick access to frozen food. Definitely think I would have used it more with the pasta maker. 

Also, I have a metal bed frame with posts and poles connecting them, and I highly recommend it because you can hang things on hooks or bungee cords to keep them within reach. 

Number one thing when you can't get out of bed is to have as many things in arms reach as possible (if you can lift your arms to grab things.) 

I also really like my Kitchen Aid for kneading bread, and you can get cool attachments for them. I honestly don't use it as much though just because making dough is a lot of work even without the kneading.

One thing to watch out for is some places don't have the wiring set up well in bedrooms, and they aren't able to handle as much as the kitchen can. This can cause the breaker to go out. You likely won't know until it happens so I recommend doing tests with your spouse at home so they can flip the switch and you aren't left without power until the come home.

If you have trouble eating/digesting, look up the dysphagia diet. I am still mad none of my doctors mentioned it to me and just kept wanting to take more food away when I couldn't even eat 700cal/day. 

I also highly recommend the blog [Not Done Living](https://notdoneliving.net) too. Ricky has been bedridden over 20 years and she has lots of great advice about getting by.

Quick follow up question: So clearly I'm going to need to look into some help from insurance. I'm seeing a new specialist (Rheumatologist if that's relevant) this week to help with pain and disease management, should I ask her for a prescription for a chair?

15cdcb0d-4335-430f-8fab-9eee1d31fc6f,1553117648,"I’m trying to respect his privacy a bit but he suffered severe brain damage while in a coma. He also has a very extreme case of epilepsy that causes seizures for him each day — a minimum of two but yesterday was 6. There are so many reasons why I think a group home could actually be a good thing, depending on the company and the people. 

While he’s having seizures he doesn’t have the ability to rationalize between his safety and what his wants/needs are. Yesterday morning he had a seizure and, while going through it, decided to have a cigarette and ended up falling on top of his oil heater. He cracked his head open — we were all sleeping but heard the noise and came to help him.

This is far from the first occurrence. This happened almost daily before I became his roommate. I’ve watched him go through a lot of falls and blows to his head — this includes holes in his drywall, seeing him fall and hit his head on the metal front door, falling off of the porch and splitting his ear open, falling into a cupboard and ripping it in half with his head... he’ll tell people that this is okay and it’s just not anymore. The other day he was having a seizure and tried to get on his bike to go to the store... 

I’m just at a loss anymore. I myself have two babies under two (one isn’t a week old yet) so it’s not possible for me to monitor him and to try to intervene. He also just doesn’t realize that people are trying to help him and becomes really combative and vindictive, making it especially risky for me as I’m on the lease to his house. This is beside the point of me wanting to make sure his safety is a priority but it’s extremely scary to be at the whim of somebody who can’t rationalize between decisions that are just “angry decision” or decisions that could potentially hurt a lot of people, without proper cause. I’ve seen this happen to other people who have lived with him many times, at least 3 that I know of, and while I’m saving money to move out I’m absolutely terrified that he’ll really hurt himself without other people living here — or that other people won’t be willing to live here due to his requirements.

He can’t afford a live-in caregiver. I’ve been doing this for him based on a bare minimum wage, but after living here for almost a year there’s been a lot that’s shown itself to make me feel really uncomfortable with him living the way that he does, as well as the power he’s being given over others. He doesn’t have a power of attorney. It’s my belief that he was a totally different guy before his coma, who still needed to have assistance in some areas due to memory complications, but who was mostly independent and could live with others well enough. After he came back from his coma and surgery, he relocated and I believe this major shift in his ability to rationalize was impacted either due to seizure activity or just because of the procedure he had to go through. 

I hope this explains enough without having to get too into detail. He’s been a really dear friend of mine for almost a decade and it’s taken a lot for me to come to terms with what’s going on with him — but if there’s another, safer alternative than a group home I’ll absolutely listen to any/all alternatives. I just want for him to be safe and happy, but for my family to be safe as well... ",,,3,0,0,

So I called and it seemed like I was pre-approved (again, probably not the right term but that's what it seemed like).

The office I called just looked me up and all I had to do was sign the form they sent me. (I didn't need to contact doctor or any extra paperwork - I guess SSA has me listed as permanent disability.) The process started immediately - really didn't have an impact on me because I wasn't making payments and hadn't been being garnished. For a few months I kept getting progress letters, and then the loans were off my record. 

I guess it'll be tentative for 3 years, because if I'm able to go back to work the loans will be back in force. I was a little worried about the earnings thing, but I think I would have to earn above the poverty level not including my SSDI in order to break the discharge agreement, but all I can manage is $200-300 a month in addition to SSDI. 

Since I don't expect to be able to go back to substantial work, and I don't have plans for college or anything, it was really a wonderful situation for me.

02faf140-582d-40b6-aa23-d19972deec5a,1552878564,"My comment wasn’t with regard to the method of data collection but rather the sourcing of it: not anonymous survey vs in-person interview but rather the internet as a locale over a recognized community of your target population.    
    
The Internet as a “community” is anonymous, unvetted, easily biased, and repeatedly proven unreliable (see the many studies on this from leaders in research like Pew). Add to this the fact that Reddit site design both encourages and powerfully enables users to disguise (and, tacitly, misrepresent) their identities.    
    
This means any data collected anonomously via the internet (&amp; Reddit particularly) is uncurably tainted, under suspicion of being sourced from a population that doesn’t hold the characteristics you assume it does. How many people took your survey more than once? How many people without the disability you’re looking to serve answered your questions? If you dismiss this concern with a “good faith” argument, then you’re in the wrong field. ��    
    
I hear often from engineering students doing their requisite disability design projects the argument that sourcing data from disabled populations is difficult because it’s hard to locate a sufficient sampling pool. My counter argument every time is that just because you’ve never looked for a community before doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. There are multiple patient-centered organizations for just about every disability you can throw a dart at. If you petition an appropriate organization they will assist you in collecting data in an ethical manner from their (at least somewhat) verified population.    
    
I’ll end my rant here with an encouragement for you to also consider the ethics of gathering sensitive personal information. Any health-related info, even the simple self-reporting of a symptom, can cause an individual serious complications in their personal or professional lives; that’s why the US has HIPPA. Collecting info in a public forum online (via a Google form no less!), even if *you* are doing it in good faith, gives your subjects no protection whatsoever for their privacy. Therefore representing your data collection as anything other than a potential personal security threat is unethical.

In any sort of photo I will try to hide the fact that I am disabled.

If they don't read the bio, that's on them. Surprise or not.  If they do and they have questions, I'll answer. I don't bring it up in conversation unless a limitation somehow might get in the way or they ask about it. So far I haven't had issues.


Now a bit of my perspective on your details:

Honestly if I saw all that listed in someone's Bio, I would pass. As someone else said it sounds like a  negative clinical record list than a picture of your personality.  I definitely don't need to know all that information upfront...just like I don't want to know someone's whole life story or all their traumas on the first date. 

I would mention ones that effect your life on a more dominant basis.  Maybe? The thing is most people have a one dimensional view of mental disorders even though everyone manifests them differently. Unfortunately we all jump to the Hollywood version of it until experience shows us differently. And all that lists shows is me is that you have some things to work on. If I didn't know you I would wonder, how bad are these illnesses? How much chaos will there be in the relationshipe? Are you working on yourself? Can you take responsibility for your behavior/problems or do the disabilities become a shield that you sometimes hide behind? Can you care for yourself(do you have a support system in place)? How much emotional workload am I going to put out dealing with this and will you be able to provide for my emotional needs when needed? That's a lot to consider before the first meeting. The wide range of unknowns and unpredictability can make it hard for people to want dip their toes in. Especially since all they know about you is ""off paper"" and their point of reference for disability is limited to popular culture.

Relevant Story.
I had a friend shortly after graduated HS who has Bi-Polar. We were friends for several months before she told me she had this illness but she had eased me into some other ones she lived with before that. We moved in together. The thing is she was pretty responsible about her health. She definitely had her high and low moments but she would give us a heads up about her moods and reach out to people.  There were times I forgot that she had mental illness and just accepted the manifestations of it as personality quirks(which is how she introduced them but also told us why they were there).  I learned how to be Ok with her problems because I got to know her and saw how she managed herself and her health.  At the end of the day she was still herself just a little off the beaten path and needed some extra support from time to time. If she had just said, 'Hey, you seem like a good person. I'm looking for a roommate but I want you to know I have all these problems that I never mentioned to you before"". I would have said, ""Nope"".

My point is it may help to let people get to know your personality as their base of reference (not your disability). Bring up illnesses, traumas, or challenges as you start to get a little closer and show them how you deal with it(in a healthy way) when they come up. It may help them know how to also help you when needed in the future. Answer questions.  But also be fairly prepared for people to walk away. It may not be something they want or have the capacity to deal with at that point in their life.",,,1,0,0,

If you have a doctor you see regularly who is available to fill out a form about your disabling conditions and work related limitations, you can request that the medical examiner send you a questionnaire for your doctor to fill out. The medical examiner should have a variety of questionnaires that address different types of conditions. 

From my experience the disability determination process is neither entirely fair nor fast, but obtaining a statement from a treating doctor, is often a great way of getting a successful outcome sooner rather than later. ",,,2,0,0,

There are programs that help pay part or all of the cost of vehicle modification, depending on the cause and nature of the disability. For information, contact your state’s Department of Vocational Rehabilitation or another agency that provides vocational services, and, if appropriate, the Department of Veterans Affairs. You can find phone numbers for these state and federal agencies in a local phone book. Also, consider the following.

Many nonprofit associations that advocate for individuals with disabilities have grant programs that help pay for adaptive devices.

If you have private health insurance or workers’ compensation, you may be covered for adaptive devices and vehicle modification. Check with your insurance carrier.

Many manufacturers have rebate or reimbursement plans for modified vehicles. When you are ready to make a purchase, find out if there is such a dealer in your area.

Some states waive the sales tax for adaptive devices if you have a doctor’s prescription for their use.

You may be eligible for savings when submitting your federal income tax return. Check with a qualified tax consultant to find out if the cost of your adaptive devices will help you qualify for a medical deduction.

Even if someone feels they have a very solid case, there is so much left to interpretation and up to a judge that it often feels not worth the risk


then you have to remember that the judge is there to determine if what they did was technically *legal*, not ethical. Most cases I've read that found in favor of accused, the judge often makes a very deliberate comment about how they arent legally *required* to do something, but they are legally allowed, even in contradiction to contracts and and policy that otherwise would be considered a breach.

I'm having a huge issue with my employer over this..they gave me an accommodation when i was diagnosed for a few months...then they rescinded it.

It's a STUPIDLY simple scenario, that's very easily solved and only has positive benefits for everyone involved.  Unfortunately they operate on whats legally required, not whats possible. ",,,2,0,0,

I obviously don't know what's in OPs case file to support the fact that they cannot work. I had a lot of documented incidents at work that helped me make that point along with a ton of support via letters from doctors and PT explaining exactly why I cannot work. 

What I was hoping to get across was that after my consultative appointment the decision was expedited. Super fast. I would think that's a trend, the administration doesn't have enough info to make a decision so they send you to their doctor to get what's missing and then ideally they would be able to then make the decision. So if OP is worried about waiting, the decision is most likely around the corner here. I just think in the long run working now wouldn't be helpful to the case.

f4d18fa8-4341-4c9e-9b7b-df64934a1b8c,1553927453,"This touches on something that was brought up during a development session for a class I facilitate on disability advocacy - Static vs dynamic disability.

One of the team members on the development team has had their left arm and right leg amputated, and they described that after they completed their OT and PT rehab program, got set up with adaptive equipment and got all their accommodation paperwork organised, they sort of forget they're disabled until they're confronted with something that's brand new. ""I know how to do the things I do, and how I do them doesn't change, day to day, its the same thing, It's different to what able bodied people do, but it's not different for me""

Vs myself, and another member of the team who's disability is more easily classified as a chronic illness. My symptoms are different day to day, My fatigue levels are different day to day, My pain levels are different day to day, my nerve function is different month to month (waxing waning) - Meaning the accommodations I need, the things I can do and how I do them are constantly changing and are often unpredictable. The accommodation paperwork I have right now may not be the accommodations I need next month.

Now, neither of those situations are better or worse. It was just a ""huh, I never thought about that"" moment for me to realise that some disabilities are static, and you can have a bit more stability/predictability in what you might need or what you can do (and that can come with a whole host of issues such as the support you know you need not being available, reliable or affordable), and some disabilities are a real guessing game as to what is going to be do-able, but also in learning ""Ok, I can physically do this, but am I actually going to pay for this tomorrow in the form on increased pain or fatigue?""

Because yes, I can stand and do the dishes without a break.... but only for a day, if I try to do that today, I will be a useless wreck tomorrow/later this afternoon. But if I pace myself, I will be able to do more in the long run, and therefore that is what I can and should be doing in order to manage my disability.

The upside of my dynamic disability is that I have the option to say ""I can't do the dishes today because of my symptoms, But tomorrow I might be up for it"" and I can postpone certain things and have that independence to do them *eventually* vs a static disability where if you can't do that thing today, that probably means you will never be able to do that thing without first getting support or assertive devices.",,,12,0,0,

Now I am like others that habit some of my family just found out when they saw the wheelchair gave me a lot of problems and one of my cousins at Thanksgiving when we were talking reminded me that I always had a limp and kept my eye on where the nearest restroom was at

The tram is accessible, but the bus is random. I use a rollator and my Mom helps me to get to university because of this reason. So I can climb up.
But the situation is pretty shitty. I have to go waay too early, because there wouls be no seat in the tram. I immediately fall if a vehicle moves, so it's really risky for me to beg for the seats. It takes time and the bus/tram wouldn't wait for me. I've fallen too many times (and some people were still assholes about the situation).
I only have seat on the bus at 7:14,after that there will be a couple of buses, but they come from somewhere else, so completely full). The next empty bus comes at 7:30,but there's no seat in the tram at that point.

I run the household finances and deal with paperwork. I have 2 jobs that I can do online, one is a virtual assistant job and the other is managing an association's membership. These each take around 3 hours a week and I can choose what hours I work so I do it when I am feeling able. 


I don't put the money for those jobs into the household budget, they go to a different account to pay for our annual holiday which gives me a bit of self esteem to know that I am paying for the fun parts of life but it's not essential for when I have a bad week or two, we look at the account before we decide what sort of holiday we can have.

94c58e1f-d97e-4aba-99fe-b38873a8949d,1553230335,"I have severe hearing loss in both ears and rely on CC for TV and movies. I live in a BIG city and we have tons of movie theaters. 

My husband loves going to the movies and I enjoy it if they have a good CC option. Here's my experience/thoughts.

OPTION 1: Many theaters offer CC glasses.  I hate wearing the glasses as they are heavy.  I already wear hearing aids that go over my ears and glasses for seeing (contacts are not an option for me).  Adding CC glasses on top of all this is annoying and painful as the weight causes my hearing aids to cut the top of my ears.  So I avoid theaters where this is what they offer.

OPTION 2: Many theaters have the kind that is a little box on a bendable arm with a plug that fits into the cup holder. 

These work great for me as I plug it into the cup holder, then adjust the arm so the box is in the lower portion of the screen and centered for my field of vision.  The words then scroll across the box, providing an experience like CC on my TV, which I am very used to. 

The only issue I've run into with option 2 is with theaters that also provide food/drink service to the seats.  

What many older theaters have done in my city is add a tray table to each seat that anchors in the original cup holder.  They have a new cup holder in the tray table, but it causes the box to be positioned too high and to the left of my field of vision, so it really doesn't work well anymore.  It is often annoying to people behind me when it's in one of these theaters as it's high enough they can see it. 

If you are in the US, I have found that AMC theater locations which do not offer food service at your seat are the best option for me.  Many of theirs have been converted for food service and I don't go to those.

If no CC is available for me, we watch more simple films (action/adventure) and I read the wiki on it before the film starts so I can follow along even if I don't get hardly any of the dialogue. 

I'd just stop in a few of your favorite/convenient theaters and see what they have for CC, then give it a try. Worst case scenario is that I don't fully get the movie in the theater and we watch it again at home when it's available for streaming. Good luck! ",,,2,0,0,

I did not consider that there could be so much functionality in a control system such as this, also I really appreciate the picture as it helps me visualise what you are describing. I think that scroll wheel for speed is a very nice touch and I see what you mean about the power switch. Although it is a nice addition, I do think I would catch my finger on it accidentally. 

&amp;#x200B;

With regards to a blended control system, you are 100% correct and allot does go wrong. This is why everything needs to be stress tested so excessively. You have to make things go purposefully wrong in order to avoid anyone else doing the same. You could argue that's the fun part though and does contribute to a more robust system. I appreciate what you're saying about having complete control and I think that being aware not to rob someone of their independence.

&amp;#x200B;

Narrow spaces do indeed suck a bit. Limiting the sensor readings to ignore a narrow space, directly opposite the user can help. So I just have beams picking up things on the left and right, sometimes within a limited range at that. Should there be a narrow space in front, there can also be some behaviour to respond to this. I think the speed could adjust in the narrow spaces.Autonomously. Then it could avoid being such an issue, just a consideration, much like the pausing when someone goes to open a door. 

&amp;#x200B;

With regards to speed, I like to do it by metres per second. I think this is a far more reasonable way to manage the speed realistically. I it way easier to judge if I am making someone move the speed of a turtle or not. Doorjambs do seem to be a constant issue that comes up. When I was in a wheelchair, they were a pain. Especially travelling to and from the kitchen with a hot drink. I think this is certainly something to consider. I think I will implement this into the simulation as per your recommendation. It's a good challenge and is simple to put in. Harder in real life though.

&amp;#x200B;

I really do still like the idea of considering battery life and might think of a nice, little bit of code to put in there. Maybe calculate how many journeys could actually be completed with the battery life being taken into account. Also, I familiarised myself with the jingles and beeps of the world. I would not last more than a couple of weeks of this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have noticed that everything for ""disabled people"" is expensive. It always seems to be the way with minority groups. Always the need and rarely the profit. I don't like that.

&gt; some of your ideas in your other comments aren't feasible for market. The exoskeleton would be impractical and too expensive, for example.  

We can dream. We can dream. One day... One day we will all have exoskeletons. We're just not wishing hard enough. Joking aside, I am genuinely curious to know how far off we are from exoskeletons, by the century. Or even a decent seat lift. I think exoskeletons will come before a decent seat lift does.

I will say that I've seen arguments (formed by people with disabilities) towards identity first language rather than person first.  Yes, we are more than our disabilities, we are undeniably people. At the same time, it's impossible to remove the disability from how you see a person - for many it is a fundamental part of their identity. They are not ashamed of it, and acknowledging that is not the same as identifying them soley by their disability.

Disability is a really diverse and complex issue. I developed physical disabilities later in life.

9874a67c-c5ce-42f1-b588-b88fcd929b0d,1552048367,"Thanks for your reply. I appreciate a response from the employer's perspective. I'm honestly so baffled and distressed by what they're doing that I've been having anxiety attacks at night. I'd I could understand their logic, it might help regulate my emotional state.

There's so much context here, I didn't mention this part, but I wonder if it might change your response: the hiring freeze won't be ending. Although they haven't said anything officially, they have been shrinking and closing our previous company's small administrative satellite offices across the country. We're in an industrial field and while they leave the core function in place in each office, they have rather aggressively cut admin staff and centralized it in corporate HQ. Obviously this makes sense from a business perspective, and I get it.

The way they've done it is odd. They haven't announced it to anyone. They deny and dodge the question if asked directly - I've heard others ask in meetings and such, and my boss keeps me fairly in the loop. But for two years they've been gradually putting all the admin offices across the country on hiring freezes, firing long-term employees (think 20+ years) suddenly and unceremoniously, and closing offices. Official word or not, it's clear what they're doing.

My site was the largest admin-wise. We were the corporate HQ of our smaller company that was bought out. We used to have over 50 admin and professional staff. After 18 months of hiring freeze and firings, mostly of managers, we're below 20. We won't be hiring more people, let alone new supervisors, as there's no one to supervise. My current boss (old-guard like me) guesses our three-person team probably has a couple of years left, and only because corporate has no idea how to do our particular function at HQ. They can't afford to lose our institutional knowledge yet.

So the office in question won't be needed by anyone else, ever, as long as I work there. And given the unofficial but clear fact that our time is limited, their solution makes even less sense to me. Why spend money on a temporary workspace when an existing one does the job better for no cost?",,,1,0,0,

You can always keep your core treatment team close to home, but time and again I've seen cases where patients stagnate in the backwaters of US healthcare until they get seen at Stanford, Hopkins, Cleveland, Mayo, etc etc etc. There's really no substitute. 

If you're on Medicaid, look into the current guidelines for your state but generally you can see a doctor in your own state or a bordering state without special approval. That doesn't mean you can't get approved for a doctor or hospital further away! As long as you can show Medicaid that no one locally has that level of expertise (or that particular test equipment or whatever), your doctor can help you get it approved for coverage. If you have mobility issues that effect your ability to travel, remember there are charities like angel flights and for those who can't fly, ground transport in ambulance or ambulette may be covered by insurance.

Not everyone in a wheelchair has atrophied legs. It's a possibility, but you'd need to speak to a doctor about that. Every case is different, and from what I understand, physical therapy can help keep muscles in shape even if they aren't in use (I may be wrong on this). 

Your sister should have no trouble making friends. Her appearance shouldn't matter, and doesn't matter to people who would really care for her as a person. My best friend, S, has horrible arthritis that causes her hands to claw. S is an amazing person who just so happens to have difficulty holding things when her joints act up. S's hands don't define my friend anymore than your sister's legs define her. *We are more than our bodies.*

I know having a loved one lose their independence and mobility is tragic. When our loved ones are hurt, we begin looking for ways to help them, because we want to make some of that hurt go away. It's important, though, not to jump to conclusions about what your sister's new life will be like. Only *she* can answer that question. Your role, as a caring brother, is to let her figure that out for herself, without you holding her hand. Help her if she asks for it, but show her you trust that she can do this on her own. That trust, and your ability to let her find her own way, are invaluable.
