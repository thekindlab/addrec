You get a rolling nine month in a 60 month span trial work period in which you can make over SGA and keep your benefits.  So unless you worked more than nine months, you are ok.  If you worked more than nine months before you reported it, then they might request repayment of benefits for any months beyond the trial work period.

 What you should be concerned about most may be that they canceled your benefits due to not complying with the CDR rather than returning to work.

That is to say it is no one’s job to go around policing our images and the like. I actually found a very funny and inspirational youtuber through it being shared to facebook. The issue with policing “inspirational porn” comes in as people try to, usually inadvertently, push a “right way” to be disabled.

They are based on the extra help from people or aids that you need to live your life. The vast majority of people claiming PIP and DLA are able to leave the house and attend university, college, a job etc. In my mind it just highlights the fact that much of the UK still thinks that you can either be a productive member of society or disabled, but not both. The precedent it sets is appalling. If major cuts were made to PIP and those affected could not go out and protest then it just removes another layer of our rights.",,,8,0,0,

They do this deliberately, in the hopes disabled people will give up and therefore, they save money. Except they don’t, they spend more in assessing everyone that they save that’s a rant for another day.

It’s easier said than done, but you have to remain calm now and plan out your appeals process for after. You Might be fine, you Might get the rates you deserve but this the dwp, I don’t want to lie to you just to make you feel better about it. Forewarned is forearmed. 

Just present the worst day to them. If you can’t do something on your worst day, don’t do it. If they needle and keep pushing you, changing the parameters of the question to get an answer, point that out to them. Be friendly, but firm. Wear your pyjamas. 

And then if you don’t get it, which it is against your favour, be ready to appeal. Are you on Facebook? There’s some wonderful support groups on there to help you appeal. And, what they sneakily do and did to me at first, was they awarded me a lower rate than what I really qualified for. They do this so people will go “oh well at least i got something, I don’t want to cause a fuss by appealing” and save them the payouts. Don’t fall for that trap. 

Yes it’s scary and it’s stressful, but do everything to show you Need the PIP and you’ll have a better starting point to appeal. I’m sorry that might not be what you want to here.

Oh and don’t expect quick results. I got my letter after about 3 months, my friend waited nearly a year, only one woman i knew got hers like 2 weeks after her assessment. They keep you stressed by taking their time.",,,2,0,0,

He was eventually diagnosed with a B12 deficiency caused by crohns. After taking some vitamin pills he gained his strength back. Unfortunately his crohns flared up because of the meds he was on previously. Now he's dealing with abdominal pain and other issues every day.

This all seems pretty horrible. But the point is he is getting better. Slowly, but still moving in the right direction. It's taking time to find the right meds and diet but as someone said the worst part of it is always the struggle after diagnosis. We are a very adaptive species. It's our big advantage. It's been hell but I know things will get better. We've just had to adapt.

I'm sorry you are going through something like this. I've seen first hand how terrifying it is. But I've also seen how people recover, how even if we have really bad days there are still small improvements showing through even if it is just trying to taper life to your new situation.

It would have been so much easier throughout the years to say you had an accident either implying another car was involved or it was a wet stormy night and you didn't see the bridge.

Chronic pain is no fun to deal with.

I did want to mention something. I have never had depression other than some situational depression due to things like flares of even worse pain where all I want to do is curl up in a ball, suck my thumb and hope it will eventually pass. So several years ago a wonderful young lady from our church was killed in an auto accident. She had graduated HS a few months before and was well loved, I cried that day, and the next, and the next, etc. After 30 days of crying every single day and not being able to shake it off and while she was a nice young lady, I didn't know her that well to be crying every day about it. I asked my husband to see if it had anything to do with my medication. It didn't take him long. I had just been started on a new med right before that girl was killed. Turns out the med already had a black-box warning that it could cause depression and suicidal ideations! No joke! I immediately quit taking it and within 2-3 days I was back to my usual self. So if out of the blue it seems some who have never been depressed, suddenly is, look at the most recent thing added into their medication list whether prescription medication, over the counter or various herbs like you would get from a homeopathic practitioner if they are known to have depressant effects, call your MD. Don't know for sure? Ask your pharmacist. In any case, some new symptom like depression needs to have a doctor involved as soon as possible. If you are scared to call your own doc.

If your brother is eligible for Social Security disability benefits (SSI/SSDI) those benefits are his benefits, although if SSA determines that he is unable to manage his own funds, SSA may require him to have a representative payee to receive and spend his benefits on his behalf to cover his necessary and personal expenses.

The amount of payment depends on whether it is SSI, based on being disabled and having very low income and assets, or if it is SSDI, based on disability. By SSA rules, people found disabled prior to age 22 may be eligible for SSDI benefits based on a parent’s earnings record if a parent is deceased or collecting Social Security disability or retirement on their own earnings record. SSDI payment amounts are based on the earnings record. SSI payment amounts are based on the federal maximum rate ($771 in 2019 for individuals), plus state supplemental payment  if any (Texas does not have supplemental payments for individuals who live outside of managed care facilities), minus any other income after deductions (and as other commentators pointed out, SSI can potentially count free or discounted housing as a form of income).

Unless the school has some kind of program for disabled Vets to attend for free or reduced tuition some of those loans are necessary to actually pay the school. If they are automatically discharged how the does the person keep attending school? Even 100% disabled veterans can work, if they want to, within their limitations.

Exactly. 

I was 10. I’m 28 now. It’s difficult because I already had diminished motor skills/coordination before I had the accident, and I still do. It’s a daily aggravation also because my joints are hypermobile, so overusing my only functional hand takes its toll. 

It’s like I’m having both hardware and software problems. 

But I don’t consider my hand to be a disability in-and-of itself. What I do consider to be a physical disability is my orthostatic intolerance/dysautonomia, chronic fatigue/chronic pain, and joint hypermobility/connective tissue issues.

Wages affect federal and state benefits that are income sensitive, disability payments do not.  So if someone is receiving food stamps, WIC, etc., once they hit the eligibility threshold, they are no longer eligible for those programs. Disability maxes out at \~$2,000 for the individual and \~$800 for eligible dependents (I'm going from memory on the figures, don't crucify if I'm off a bit) - hardly enough to support a family with no other means of income.

Additionally, wages are reported to the IRS and therefore taxable; if you are paying into state, federal and SS, aren't you just subsidizing your disability payments and reducing your net ""income""?

I'm just a random person on the internet, not a clue about how things work but most states had no cost health insurance for kids. You're not working, limited income, so google ""your state health plan""

For Texas, it is called CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Plan)

[https://www.texaschildrenshealthplan.org/what-we-offer/chip](https://www.texaschildrenshealthplan.org/what-we-offer/chip)

Do you have a walk in clinic nearby? Most have super cheap (no cost) so walk in your scripts, sit down with a doctor (they have to talk to you and most likely you will walk out with a script good for another year. Explain to the doc you need a generic.

Also google ""your city drug trials"" ([https://clinicaltrials.gov/](https://clinicaltrials.gov/)) to see if anything is PAID to volunteers. Even if you don't qualify often they have run full blood work, given you a physical, provided written paper work to all this. The docs/PA's I've meet have been fantastic even though I never qualified (dual medical issues, so they don't want to make one worse by treating the other).

With Depression. It sucks. For me it felt like I had fallen down into a bottomless pit. Thankfully I was able to meet up with doc and start on a SSRI. It was just enough to help me get out the funk.

First of all, you can go on social security at retirement age regardless of what you do, so he just has bad info. He’s just flat out wrong about how that works. 

You can lose your disability funding if you’re able to work. I’m friends with people who have serious disorders but with accommodation and equipment can work. I’m unfortunately not one of those people and I’m like you, I’d love to work. I want to integrate into society as much as I’m able.

Do a little research and see how going to school affects your benefits so you’re prepared.  Remember, just because you are able to go to school or work now doesn’t mean you will always be able to, BUT and the system does accommodate that. There is a trial period for weaning off of benefits, and should you become to sick to work., you can go back on them. You’ll have to get approved again, but with such a long medical history it probably won’t be as difficult as it is for most people the first time.

Regarding him being controlling - Yes, he’s being controlling. He’s probably scared to lose you if you’re capable of doing certain things he isn’t.

The idea is to prevent someone from say, getting paid thousands in Amazon gift cards or something and claiming they don’t get income.

Unfortunately in the US they keep the rules intentionally subjective but a general guideline is that something is not considered “gainful” or substantial work or employment at less than 10 hours a week, 40 hours a month, or earning over an amount that I think is about a grand these days.  I still wouldn’t do those things even if I was able because they make it so risky to even try to earn any income, but what I’m basically saying is that if you’re buying a friend a Groupon that is for a specific activity or item you should be fine.

I would agree with the other commenter and say that a partial is definitely a good start (especially since you're in college and probably don't have big $$$ to spend)

I know that there are 2 kinds of somewhat unique head types that allow for greater vision while worn. A kemono type head (Japanese style with large eyes) or a realistic head with no eyes. Obviously the latter is very unique and not everyone is a fan of the realistic style, but the youtuber Shetani has a great suit that actually makes use of her glasses. Otherwise, I believe most toony fursuit heads have room for glasses, but if you found a certain maker you liked, I'd just check with them that glasses would fit. (Some makers who do more realistic heads use resin bases that would be otherwise impossible to use with glasses)
Another option would be changing the type of mesh used in the eyes. Most mesh used in the toony style heads is fairly densely woven, but when held up to the eye it kind of creates the effect of looking through a window screen. If you find a maker you like, I would possibly talk to them about using a less-dense mesh in order to increase visibility.

As for footpaws, I would definitely try to mock up something that's similar to footpaws if you can, and to test walking around in those? I know my cousin with CP needs all the traction she can get with her shoes in order to walk (with an aid) so I would definitely test some stuff out before committing to an idea. Maybe you could get shoe covers? Think of like those cheap halloween costumes where they just have the fabric you slip over your shoe with the little strap that goes underneath your foot so it looks like you're ""wearing"" boots. If done by a skilled fursuiter, that could be a good ""faux footpaw"" without hindering any of your normal mobility.

And of course, have a handler, especially for your first time fursuiting. I've done a couple intense cosplays myself where I've needed a friend to act as a handler. Not just to ""protect"" me/my cosplay from the people around me, but to make sure I'm doing ok. There's a few good YouTube guides on why all furries should have handlers (especially at public events)

Sorry this is so long (and possibly unwarranted, oops), best wishes you in your fursuiting endeavors!",,,1,0,0,

c89d8b55-ee70-4e80-81b2-f2bfc4ccb3b9,1557114981,"I would start looking into women's shelters nearby, and be sure to utilize private browsing tabs and clearing browser/call history. If you can talk to your family or friends and get a ride somewhere, that could at least get you out of the house to be picked up by someone else to go to a shelter. 

Coming from an abusive family, my best advice to make it through this is to keep your head down and maintain normalcy as much as possible at home. If you can, try to slowly stash away clothes, toiletries, etc, in a bag you can hide and easily get to. I call this a ""go-bag,"" where you at least have the bare essentials in the event of an emergency. Buy a burner phone (can find them at places like Dollar General and Walmart) if you can, and program all your important numbers, just in case he breaks your phone or has access to/control over your phone service account. Make sure all your important documents (social security card, birth certificate, medical records, etc) are secure and safe, maybe even leave them with a trusted friend or family member for you to collect later. When you feel safe enough to, then you can take the final step and gtfo. If it takes you a while because of financial or emotional setbacks, that's okay, and you're not wrong for feeling fearful or powerless. I would suggest hiding out with a friend, preferably one that he doesn't know where they live, until you can get set up with your own place or with an accessible women's shelter. 

I know right now you probably feel powerless and hopeless. I want you to know that your situation is not your fault, it's nothing you have precipitated, and you deserve so much better. In case anyone tries to tell you otherwise, they're full of shit. If you feel guilty or ashamed or like you're making a big deal of nothing, know that he is the one who has put those feelings in your head, and you aren't doing anything wrong. 

As for surviving right now, I'd suggest trying to spend as much time as you can with friends and family, but discretion is key. Going slow and gradually increasing your time away from home makes it less suspicious. Then, it might seem completely normal to spend the night there or ""go out of town"" for a couple days. That gives you a window to take a few days to figure things out before he'd get wise to the fact that you left. Again, try to be as boring and inconspicuous as possible at home, and cover all your tracks. That might include logging out of reddit every time you use it, to make sure he doesn't see posts like this. I don't know how much he hovers and snoops, but a bit of paranoia is understandable in this situation. 

A's much as it sucks to say it, don't count on an apology or ever getting to give him what-for and air your grievances. Unfortunately, that could just make the situation a lot worse for you, and you want to put as much distance between the two of you as you can. Block everywhere, never ever answer his calls, file a protection order or restraining order if you fear he might come and hurt you, and don't let your well-meaning family or friends let any info slip. 

And finally, once you are free of him and his influence, I highly recommend finding a trauma therapist. Those of us at r/CPTSD have all kinds of great discussions and resources in the meantime, and it might help you to find the right kind of therapist and therapy method to help you. I know it might seem silly or unnecessary, but you'd be surprised what crazy behaviors and thought patterns we pick up when trying to survive abuse. It can be really helpful to unlearn all the shit that comes from making yourself as small and unassuming as possible all the time. 

I wish you the best of luck, and I know you can do this. It will absolutely be hard, but it's worth it for your safety and happiness.",,,3,0,0,

In practice often times representative payees will set up a plan with the beneficiary, so that after the payee covers monthly expenses like rent and bills, they may make the remaining funds (in whole or in part) available to the beneficiary so that they can directly cover other personal or daily expenses.  Other payees will make funds available to the beneficiary only when the beneficiary asks for money for something. It is generally up to you and your payee to work out an arrangement. 

Having a representative payee who you know and trust and is available to work with you is generally very helpful.

I could drink fluid, but not movement.

I called my doc, who suspected a blockage and told me ER - now!

ER got me. ""Doc I can not poop!"" I was put into a back room. After few hours got in for a CAT scan. No blockage, just impacted. Irony is the sigmoid was clear, but my descending colon was like rocks. Impacted. Few hours later Doc came back and asked if I wanted anything for the pain.

I'm here because I can not take a shit!""

Oh, I've discovered ""no BM"" is common issue for addicts abusing opioids, so everyone assumed my symptoms (shaking, sweating) were opioid withdraw. 

As I was leaving, after spending 15 hours there, the ER doc added ""do talk to your primary physician about the mass in your lung"".  I had a persistent cough, dismissed as allergies. Nope, lung cancer. NSCLC-Adenocarnoma.

Your concerns are valid, but if I knew my partner was afraid I would ""encroach on their independence/freedom"" somewhere in the future I would feel so hurt and turned off I wouldn't want to continue my relationship.

But ultimately you don't owe this person anything. if you're this preoccupied with all the potential sacrifices you haven't had to make yet, you probably won't be happy about it when it comes time to deliver. 

I don't hold it against you that you're uncomfortable with disabilities, lots of people are. I respect how honest you're being with yourself.

I don't think the author had any ill intentions but it definitely read like someone writing about something they have no first hand experience with. 

&gt;*Have you ever thought about how you would answer or know your phone is ringing if you were not able to hear or see it?*

Really? Seriously. I got my second cell phone in 2001. My second absolutely could VIBRATE. This has been an option for deaf/hoh people for decades.

Cell phone camera flashes have been able to blink for YEARS. Certainly not as long as vibrate but still this is not new.

&gt;*Or what if you were trying to tell Siri a command but every time try she just doesn’t understand what you are saying (we all know that frustration, right)?*

My typical sibling doesn't even use Siri because it hardly works and they speak fine. I use Android and have a slight speech issue. Google works almost flawlessly after some training. I imagine that people with less clear speech might have difficultly but people with heavy foriegn accents would have the same difficulty. 

&gt;*Could you imagine getting a video call from your loved one and being able to see them talking but unable to hear?*

It was my understanding that video calling being mainstream was a huge plus for deaf/hoh folks? Seems like problem here would be a person not being able to sign.

This article definitely is ignorant in real technological features that come built into phones. They are not new having been round for years. They are not perfect and will never be able to address all disabilities but they cover a great deal of basic functions to make using a phone or tablet much easier for a range of disabled people.

(Income deeming rules apply from spouses to spouses and from ineligible parents to eligible children, but not from a child to a parent). If there is an award of spousal support that would be counted as your unearned income and may impact your SSI payment amount. But SSI considers child support as a child’s income and does not count a child’s income as part of an eligible parent’s income.  See their policy on deeming [https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0501320001](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0501320001) and their policy on child support [https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.NSF/lnx/0500830420](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.NSF/lnx/0500830420) 

One way a child’s income could potentially impact your SSI payment amount would be if you used your child’s income to cover your own share of food and housing expenses. SSA could possibly count that as income to you in the form of in kind support, depending on other factors. But as long as you are paying for your own share of food and housing expenses with your benefits, and using the child’s income to cover their own share of food and housing expenses, then this should not apply.

This is a totally personal decision, and I'm not going to guilt anyone who makes the decision to not date someone who has a disability.  But I dated someone who took a year and a half to decide that it wasn't right for them, and in that time I grew quite close to that person, and it made it all the more devastating in the end.  They were quite frank, too; they told me point blank that it was because of my disability...""You're great, but...""

In all that time, they never talked to me about their concerns for fear of hurting my feelings.  They tried to think and decide all on their own, without any input from me, and let me believe that we were just fine and nothing was threatening our relationship.  I was pretty blindsided.

Don't let your concerns about hurting feelings, or about seeming ""less progressive"" keep you in a relationship with a disabled person if you don't want to be in it.  Don't do us any favors.  It only leaves you feeling trapped, and it only hurts us worse in the end.",,,1,0,0,

The workers and drivers are generally rude to everyone, so I would limit any unnecessary interaction with them and be prepared for your bus arriving late, not having a driver, being oversold, or some other issue that puts you on the next schedule/bus and delays your final arrival. They have a mobile app and a website that you can can use to see how late the bus is running/the updated departure time.

If it’s a regular station, then I would show up at least 30 mins before departure just in case. If you are traveling with a large bag or suitcase you’ll have to “check it” for free. They will just weigh it and give you a tag to put on it in case it gets lost. Then you’ll sit down in the waiting area with your luggage until they yell your bus number and the door to line up at. Someone (the driver usually) will check your ticket at the door, and if the bus is almost full, they may organize people in line by their boarding number on the ticket. 

As you approach the bus, someone will be there to put your suitcase under it for you. Then you’ll step up 3 or 4 large steps. The unspoken rule is to sit as close to the front as possible, so I would try to get the first or second row. They may stop for a 5-15 minute break at a gas station or similar place, where people can walk, smoke, etc. before getting back on the bus and continuing on. When you exit the bus at your next stop/transfer or final destination, be sure to collect your luggage.

If you are getting on the same bus, the driver will have given you what’s called a “reboarding pass” with a number they call before other ticket holders that lets you get back on the bus first. If you are just transferring buses, repeat the entire process from sitting in the waiting room with your checked bag.",,,2,0,0,

I don't understand the benefit of doing this since these are things he can't control. It's not like he has annoying habits that you can ask him to work on.

But really, you don't need a ""reason"" to break up with someone other than you're not compatible. It's up to you whether or not to feel guilty and it's up to others whether or not to see you as a jerk. You can't control them and you really don't need to defend your decision. 

I'm sure he's not dense and that he knows his disability will affect his dating life and relationship prospects. Think about what you want your life to look like and if he is compatible with it.

Eating causes blood to pool in your abdomen to help digest food, but can make your symptoms temporarily worse, so I avoid eating immediately before I need to be upright. Wheelchair use can make it worse, so if it is your primary reason, then maybe try other means of treatment first or you may find yourself reliant upon wheelchair use and it will be much harder to cope with at that point.

Well, all I can say is that nothing is more attractive than confidence, humour and kindness. Ofc there's more but these are always what get me to crush on someone instantly. I think women are more forgiving with physical appearances but maybe that's just me. I think if you can be yourself, make her laugh, make her feel heard and it feels natural to hang out, then you've got a pretty good chance of sustaining something. I know, easier said than done.

Finding a connection is pretty tough though, disabled or not. I have plenty of male asian friends who are able bodied who can't seem to land a date. It's possible that hollywood's portrayal of asian men being unattractive is contributing but it's now changing! \*Cough\* Crazy Rich Asians. I guess it also depends where you live but I think it's become ""trendy"" to be with an asian man if you're not asian yourself? So don't give up! 

Dating does get tougher once you're out of school and no longer heading to bars. Personally, I find you're more likely to meet someone through work. Usually by proximity / sharing same work experience but they also get to know you in a non-romantic environment which allows them to grow and fall in love with you with no pressure! There is no trying to impress anyone. There's you, being yourself, as a friend/colleague/person. 

I would say, work on yourself and show up for yourself. Put yourself out there. Talk to girls (or anyone) with no expectations of dating/rejection and you'll find your way from there :)

It blew my mind a few years ago when I realized asking someone for a glass of water didn't mean I was asking them to be in pain. Most people can get up and get a drink without enduring physical pain. I know this, but it still seems strange to me.

If you shop online because you have a disability and it makes things easier, go ahead. If you're too busy with work or can't bear the thought of dragging your kids to the store, order online. Take advantage of a promotional offer for free delivery. Or just order online because the service is available.

Personally, I don't do much online grocery shopping because I worked in that role and I wouldn't trust most of my coworkers to  actually get my order correct.

The definition of disability used in the ADA and other disability rights statutes is much more expansive and inclusive that the definition of disability for the purposes of publicly administered benefits programs.  For example, if I have diabetes that is well managed and controlled by medications, I would not be eligible for Social Security disability benefits on the basis of diabetes, however, I might have the right to request reasonable modifications at my workplace under the ADA such as additional or longer breaks for me to take my medications, check my glucose and manage my dietary needs.",,,1,0,0,

Two of my favorites are Mom's in their 30's with small kids. Yes they have Parkinson's. When I was first noted as Parkinson's I was 25 so it was rapid dismissed as ""too young"". That was 1983. 36 years later I still have Parkinson's, but I'm a very strange one as the more I have been working out the less my symptoms are.

It took me a while to learn this. I've been in a few long term relationships in my early 20s while my symptoms were ""mild"" and learned that my parters didn't care about my physical disability but rather the state of my mental health. They couldn't stand that I wasn't happy, or was being negative. I was very anxious and likely not as fun to be around. Even in a relationship, I found I wasn't happy so something had to change within myself. So, I worked on my independence -  emotionally and physically. I was preparing to be single for the rest of my life. I figured if I was going to be alone, I should at least be happy while I'm at it.

Before meeting my current partner, I've always been emotionally reserved and the dates I did go on, I would keep them at a distance. I guess I feared rejection and knew not to get my hopes up due to my situation (as I always suspected they didn't want to invest in / commit to me).  Of course I assumed this and maybe didn't give them a chance but as I got older and my symptoms worsened, I discovered it did scare potential dates away. A big blow to my self esteem for sure. With time, it gets to you and you feel awful about yourself. I've been there.

Welp, you can't force or make people love you or see past your condition but you can love yourself, enjoy your solitude and find joy/gratitude through friendships and family. I'm a firm believer that you'll attract people/things/experiences that reflect your state of being. 

Best of luck! x

Spinal cord injuries are classified in two ways. Firstly, the level of injury will tell you where the spine was damaged and as a result which nerves do not function. The spine is named in regions called the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral (top to bottom) and each vertebra has a number within that section with the lowest number being the highest vertebra. The cervical spine is where the nerves controlling the arms are, so an SCI in the cervical spine leads to quadriplegia. Paraplegia is a result of an injury below T1.

The next part of the classification is the ASIA (American spinal injury association) classification which goes from A-E. ASIA-A: a complete loss of feeling and movement. ASIA-B: feeling, but no movement. ASIA-C: feeling and movement, but more than half of key muscles can move, but not against gravity. ASIA-D: feeling and movement, more than half of key muscles can move against gravity. ASIA-E: feeling and movement normal.

With traumatic SCIs in particular, the injuries can resolve themselves over time. It might be helpful to think about the nerves being bruised, so until the bruising heals, the nerves dont work. When you sustain an SCI, physios will work hard to prevent muscle wasting so that if the nerves do start to function again, there are still muscles there for them to use. A complete paraplegic cannot walk, but their injury classification may change, so they would then be an incomplete para and be able to walk. It is important to note that this change in function happens soon after injury, not years later.

With a classification of ASIA-A/B/C the person will not be able to walk. With a classification of ASIA-D, depending on the muscle groups that can be used it is possible to walk, but it will most likely involve very intense physio and possibly orthotics and walking aids. It can be physically exhausting trying to compensate for the non-functioning muscle groups and as a result, they may still need to use a wheelchair outdoors or for longer journeys to avoid pain, fatigue and to reduce the risk of falls.

The chances of being reclassified from ASIA-A to D is an awful lot slimmer than C-D for example, so someone with an incomplete SCI is more likely to be able to walk again. It does happen, but it is rare.",,,3,0,0,

e038a184-d3ea-496f-9f65-20567dafebfe,1557355290,"This is what I do. 

I also meal prep so I have something *healthy* in the fridge ready to eat or heat in &lt;5 mins when the alarm goes off. I find that otherwise I end up eating whatever crap is quickest, I crave at that exact moment or avoiding it altogether because 'I'll just do this before I start cooking' which takes two hours and I forget to eat anyway. If you have more of an attention span than I do this will not be necessary. 

Look at your meals in general. Are you packing the calories in there? You can eat less often if you eat calorie dense foods. Some people do One Meal A Day (OMAD) where they get all their calorie requirements in one meal. I haven't tried this as I need to eat little and often but it may be suitable for you! 

Also set alarms for snacks. I don't know what your dietary requirements are but if you're trying to gain weight this is a biggie. Make a list of what a snack for you is and pin it up in your kitchen. If possible, bag them out in advance. If not, keep the fridge stocked. My regular snacks are; bag of nuts/fruits/seeds, dried fruit rolls, cereal/protein bar, wholemeal/seeded toast with nut butter or smushed banana, veggies with a bean or avocado dip, small portion of a regular meal, smooth fruit smoothie (chunky will keep you full longer), rice/lentil cake/cracker with calorie dense topping. 

And the hard part...get used to eating when you're not hungry. Do the opposite of dieters, give yourself distractions while you eat. When I need to gain weight I watch TV while eating a huge plate, it goes a lot faster. Force yourself to eat that snack when you're not hungry, unless you feel sick. Food is fuel and all that, it's hard to eat when you're not hungry but you get used to it.

I believe, as we true when I got disability about 15 years ago, the only wages that a lawyer can get for representing you is 20% of the back pay that SS will give you for the time you apply until it is granted. He may see that you are only maybe going to get say $3000 as back pay. 20% of that is $600 which is not enough pay for him to take on the job. And of course, you check would be $2400. The percentage may have changed, I'm not positive.

Being ""different"" is a disadvantage and I find when you open up about your ""downfalls"", it robs the opportunity of others getting to know the real you. There is no chance of a build up in courtship. Some people can't seem to get past the physical differences as it really hinders their perception of us, (or anyone living with health issues). People forget we didn't choose to have a disability/get sick. The unknown really terrifies people and some choose to be ignorant.

And I agree, the word disability has a lot of negative associations with it. Sometimes I'll use ""differently abled"" or something along those lines but sometimes I'll consciously use the word Disability to get people used to hearing it in a different way. I'll try to empower the word and educate instead of fearing/avoiding it.

You're blessed to have a daughter and one you've raised to have compassion. I'm a woman who wants to have children some day but I fear of the inevitable hardship I'll endure due to my limited mobility + strength. Before I met my current partner, I was always hard on myself, thinking I couldn't ever have children or that no one would want me as their life partner. Eventually, I've made peace with both outcomes of motherhood.

I also manage my environment to manage my symptoms. Although, it gets quite exhausting sometimes but that's part of our plight.

Have faith! I find for me, meeting someone organically was always the best way to find love / companionship, even before I became disabled. This sounds cheesy but I worked on loving myself first and its attracted my current partner now. My advice is: be positive, love yourself and it'll attract the right things / things you deserve :) Best of luck!

Here is some general information about SSA rules and practices. In the absence of other significant evidence, evidence of successful participation in leisure or other activities without significant difficulties or assistance, can be construed by SSA as evidence of work related capacity. However by SSA rules, they should also consider any difficulties, limitations or assistance required in activities as affirmative evidence of disability.  The fact that someone has significant difficulties in engaging in activities such as hobbies, school or work can be taken as evidence that supports a finding of disability. If engaging or trying to engage in an activity triggers or exacerbates symptoms, that is generally taken as evidence of significant limitations. 

I strongly recommend discussing this concern with your attorney so that they may be able to better contextualize and frame this event in their arguments to the judge if necessary.  Your attorney will request and review records from your therapist and other health care providers, and additional contextual information from you may be helpful as your attorney works with you to prepare for hearing. A large part of your attorney’s job is to help present your best case to the judge. Having honest and accurate information from you will help your attorney do their job.

fc6cc0b5-4e1e-4f85-9266-4caa2901dbc7,1556891864,"I hear you for sure, except that no one's telling me this--I'm telling myself. I've been working all my adult life and have been on a downhill slide until I had a complete mental breakdown and became totally disabled. I've finally been diagnosed with ASD, but since I limped along in society for so long, it's hard for me to accept that I qualify as disabled--even though I would tell anyone else like me that of course they are and their struggles aren't trivial etc etc. Mental illness really stands between me and any kind of self-love or -acceptance. Both sides of my family are very ""by your bootstraps"" and didn't know much about, talk about, or really acknowledge mental illness until I broke that trail. Turns out both sides are rife with it, but no one ever talked about it. Like, I didn't even know there was a word for how I was until I was like 17 (persistent and treatment-resistant depression, generalized anxiety, and of course the autism). I didn't realize how much I'd been taught to look down on people who don't, or ""won't,"" work until it was me. Not that I was mean to anyone or family members were, it was just little things like how so many people get financial aid who don't ""deserve"" it because they're not disabled enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Well now that person is me. And I've been having a really hard time accepting the help I'm so fortunate to be given from the government. I can cover all my expenses, though if I had to drive I wouldn't be able to. I tell myself that the money goes right back into the economy and that I've tried my best to work and it led to me just disintegrating as a human being. Now I just don't know what to do with my life, and part of me hates myself for being a burden on society. Even though of course I would tell anyone else that that's ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

So I think, OP, that your family is very much like mine. I'd also like to tell you, though, that my family has come around enough to support me--even if I can't support myself. My mom didn't ""believe in"" depression and I had to drag her into the psychiatrist's office to have a doctor tell her that this actually exists and is in my brain, I'm not just whining or ""sad sometimes."" They've been supportive of my recent ASD diagnosis, and when I get depressed and self-loathing they tell me that I'm not a burden, they're not disappointed in me, and what I've gone through is real and I shouldn't feel bad about accepting help.

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's part of *me* that feels like....what if I'm just lazy? When there's nothing to point to or prod or treat, it's hard to ""justify"" to myself not working. I feel like a lazy POS bum, even though I know what will happen if I push too hard. Like you, I just want to be normal and have a job and feel like a contributing member of society. It's really upsetting to me that I don't know if or how I can do that.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe it's possible that they'll come around if you keep trying? It took a very long time for my family to accept the way I am and that there are legitimate labels for it. I guess what I'm saying is, keep trying with them. It's worked pretty hard into society that you're supposed to work and be able to support yourself, and people who can't or won't are lesser. I think it kind of just comes along inevitably with a capitalist society. It's a perceived meritocracy, and I think that when people see someone getting something *they* don't think they ""deserve,"" it's upsetting to them and they blame the person and are resentful. Because of how it's *supposed* to work. You're *supposed* to work hard and get what you earn for yourself and deserve.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I think there's a really big generational component. IMHO, Boomers were *able* to work hard at one job for their whole career and get benefits and pay and stability that they take for granted. They feel like it was so easy for them to do, it all just happened, so how can everyone nowadays not do it too? They must be lazy. It's just not like that anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention, support services for matching people with disabilities to work that works for them are just nonexistent. We're not a valued part of the work force to begin with, and we have to fight for accommodation and to make ""able"" people understand that we *do* very much want to work, but it has to not destroy us in the process. I think a lot of people just don't understand that sometimes we have to choose between doing ""normal"" things and continuing to exist. What for other people might be routine can cost us a lot, and mental illness is there lurking and just waiting for us to weaken.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope your family becomes more supportive in the future. Maybe you could speak with a psychologist about how to talk to them about it? Maybe bring them one at a time to some sessions to talk through all this? Having a medical authority speak with my mom, and having numerous medical assessments from my ASD specialist has really helped me and my family situation. Or even if there's like a book or something on how to talk to people about disability? 

&amp;#x200B;

Be well OP, hang in there!

in a normal situation or setting this would work.

in the past I have tried such thing but in response have only gotten negative problems from it in my situation. an example would be... I fold the laundry (i dont do this)... they would get used to me folding laundry and start expecting me to do it all every time.

also in my situation... a few months ago after being institutionalized... I have lost everything I owned and came home with only one set of clothing. everybody said they would help of course, but no one did. I bought tons of clothes, a tv, an xbox, a mattress, as well as several other thing id need (a fan, ect.). I even got smart and bought a t shirt press to make my own sublimation ink t shirts instead of buying premade t shirts at a higher price. 

i keep this in mind when im asked to do something for somebody and they get used to it. if I were to do a simple task... theyd give me nothing. if a stranger were to do a simple task... theyd instantly whip out money to give them. Im my shoes... I need plenty of money for medications that I am on (6 pills a day, 2 medications, soon to be a 3rd). Sometimes I just need $2 for a refill on a medication... and I am told many curse words, with family forgetting all the things Ive done for them.

I literally bought everything I have right now possession wise, I buy my own food, pay my own bills (not theirs), cook my own meals, and do what I want to do. 

It beats being cursed out over a box of pizza that I never asked for any day!

I have a number of mental health problems and a few chronic pain conditions that have disabled me since I was a teen and then later after a few years of improvement I was in a series of car accidents that created more issues in my early twenties.  I went from a person who worked 60 to 80 hours a week because I never wanted to be dependent and at the mercy of anyone again, I was set to be promoted to a position of area manager in my company and then expected in another year to be a district manager at 24 making what would be a more than comfortable salary roughly 20 years later; all this because I had more hustle than anyone else ready for promotion at the time.  And then I could barely manage 15 hrs a week or even less suddenly following the aforementioned car accidents.

Like you, family, friends and even some co workers all thought I was lazy and a malingerer and how nice it would be to take off so much work.  I have had so many people who have known me talk shit about me for going on two decades, including my older sister who now has been disabled with some of the very same or similar issues.  She acts like she is the only one who ever had problems in their life and it's a competition of who had it worse.  She acts like  my younger sister who was diagnosed with schizophrenia at age thirteen is also lazy and mooching off my parents despite the fact that she's been on SSI disability benefits since forever and that the times my sister tried to get a job, my abusive parents did things to sabotage her.  I also have a great aunt who literally wrote shit in birthday cards every year scolding me for supposedly eating and sleeping my life away and that my problems weren't real.  And how disappointed and angry that I have wasted my life.  I really wish I could have written her back to ask who the fuck did she think was more disappointed about *my* damned life and who would willing choose to be in my position.  But I didn't want to give her a heart attack so.  Yeah, so you can see I am real salty about all this shit from ppl. 

 I have cut a lot of people out of my life but it's hard finding new people who are patient and understanding and don't get burned out from caring too much early on and then having it be too much later.

Anyhow, without me further rambling on, I just want to say that I totally get where you are coming from and can completely relate to the way people have treated you regarding you being disabled and unable to work.  Like you, I would give anything to not have a life that is a permanent sick day; to be able to work; have a career; have money and a car and a place to live that was my own again; to have something to show for the 41 years I have been alive; to have more of a social life; to see and do things that I have always wanted to do but haven't because of all the things holding me back; to not be forced to live from day to day because it is such a struggle to contend with physical and emotional pain every day of my life for over 20 years now; to not have fucking relatives who are so goddamned clueless and disappointed (boo fucking hoo for them, they already have an AF fighter pilot son, that's not enough) I didn't make the family look good asking me what my life goals are for the next year and what my five year plan looks like.  

So again, I get you and I too wish I could be able to instantly transmit data into the heads of everyone I come across who I truly need to understand what it is like for me and really for everyone who is disabled or chronically ill or in pain, including medical professionals.

Otherwise I wish there was something positive I could say to you here.  I try not to be too negative or angry about things I can't control and I especially want to be simply a positive entity here on reddit, but I suppose we and many others both have very legitimate reasons to be angry and frustrated.  Our very sense of self is basically denied by so many people in our lives, including the people who should love and support us the most.

So I guess ultimately all I can say (after blathering so much, haha) is that you're not alone.  And I should also thank you for giving me the opportunity to get a lot off my chest that I rarely ever talk about.  I also sincerely hope along the way you find people who will either understand what you go through with your disabilities or at least make a point of caring about you and trying to understand as well as accept you at face value.",,,9,0,0,

I knew two people very jealous of my many disabilities that have been trying their hardest to claim they are disabled but no doctors will sign off for them that they are. 

One is my uncle that has mild diabetes but never takes his medicine and complains for attention alot. 

Another is my step mom who thinks she doesnt have to go to work because of migraines LOL, her doctor wont even diagnose her with migraines and keeps telling her to suck up her headaches and grow up LOL!

My dad is starting to become a cry baby for attention now after my step mom became this way. He lays in bed all day (hasnt been to work in 7 months), doesnt even get the mail, answer the doorbell, does his dishes, or cook. He literally thinks his exhaustion from getting out of bed is a real disability and people like me dont deserve it, WTF? 

my main disabilities are cancer (25+ tumors removed from sinus's/brain in facial area), multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, a bunch of organs that I had removed (one lung, 2 parts of intestines), osteoarthritis, rhuematoid arthritis, schizophrenia, schizoid personality disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, major depression, and PTSD. I have several other disabilities that are minor or havent been a problem lately (asthma, non-cancerous tumors, ect.). 

For someone to judge me and my disabilities... then use migraines or exhaustion as an excuse for a ""real disability"" is just sickening!

Id rather be healthy, work hard, and do overtime for the things I want/need then be in the situation Im in.

I get that the ideal situation would be accepted for who you are but it seems your relationships have turned the corner from appropriate empathy for you to intolerance. I am being blunt here because I know that isolation will only compound your physical and mental decline. Think of ways you can be accommodating on your own terms to helping family and friends. Perhaps make it known that you are going to try to spend an hour every Monday after lunch doing errands and if they have anything they need done that you could help them with to just let you know. You might offer things like letting their dog out for a potty break, picking up their prescriptions, taking their ups package to get mailed, turning off their sprinkler if they want to start it when they are home for lunch, getting copies made for them. It will let you keep control of your time and hopefully stop the impression that your time is theirs and that you are always available. On a different note, I myself do not have a disability and yet I deal with the exact same prejudices because I do not have a M-F set hours job. I try to establish with the ‘jealous’ people in my life : hey I am not opposed to having an equal give and take relationship but I am not your on call errand boy.

I assure you,  there is nothing to be jealous of! Yes, technically I could get disability benefits if I had 2 years,  a lawyer and wanted to have to constantly ""prove that I'm really disabled"" to people who don't actually know shit about being disabled.  Especially with the trump administration constantly trying to find any excuse to cut benefits from disabled people.  Plus you deal with the stigma of the general public and financial struggles. 

 That said, even if these things weren't issues,  I would still  HAVE to work because if I didn't I'd basically mentally rot away.  For me, the mental rot I suffered during my time as a NEET was far worse than the physical torture I go through to work.   

If you ask a lot of people that are visibly disabled, they too will talk about this mental rot thing. I was actually talking to a friend of mine who is also in a wheelchair about it the other day. He said the reason that he works is that  He sees  What being on social security does to the minds of his friends that are on it.  Based on my experience with being out of work before, living that way would make my mental issues a lot worse and I would probably end up killing myself.  

I'm not saying everyone that lives on social security ends/will end up like that, some people are better off on social security. What I am saying is that many people who end up on social security do not want to be there and not every more visibly disabled person has the choice to  go on disability,  not even the ones in the categories you mentioned.

It took me 11 years to get a BS degree (heh) and shortly after I did, I filed for and got SSDI. So I have six figures of student loans that I can't get discharged because I'm disabled but not THAT disabled (student loan discharge requires complete and total disability, unlike social security). And my degree contributes nothing to my past, current, or future income. Although education enriched my life in an intangible way, it was a very poor investment otherwise.

I work very part-time, which is actually helpful for my conditions (mental illness - a schedule and routine is really good for me) and so often people say thoughtless crap like, ""oh, it must be nice to work part-time"" or ""what do you do with all your extra free time?""

I didn't know when I asked him out that he usually has his DSW with him, but he mentioned it in a text when we were discussing where to go for the date, he was very breif, just saying ""I hope you don't mind, my support worker is helping me get there, but they won't be there during the date"" I didn't mind at all.

During the date (we just went to a cafe in the city for coffee) his support worker introduced himself and was polite but then excused himself and sat at a different table reading a book paying no attention to us. He was within ear shot if my date needed to ask for something but otherwise it was no different to a regular first date.

But he didn't have any mobility or physical limitations that would require his DSW to be nearby. So I can see how it might feel very different if you needed your assistant to be close and help with personal tasks during the date. Though if that had been the case on my date that still would not have been a problem. It's just a matter of finding a partner who is understanding of the realities of disability. Some people need assistants, that doesn't make them less deserving of going on dates.

Have a chat with your PCA/DSW about how they would like to be treated on the date, and ask your date-partner what they would be comfortable with; for example, would everyone prefer for your assistant and what they're doing to be seen but not fully acknowledged, or is everyone comfortable with talking about what your needs are and making a few light hearted comments, or would they maybe even like to get to know your assistant as if it's like a date with a partner and meeting one of their friends.

Hopefully someone can answer from the other side of this situation. For me there was an added element of nervousness going on that date because I didn't want to misunderstand the relationship my date had with his DSW. I felt awkward having his support worker sit apart from us because I wasn't sure if that's how they normally interact or if my presence was making them change how they provided support. I eventually said to my date ""I don't mind if [your support worker] sits with us, I'm getting to know you, and he's important in your life, so if you want I should get to know him too"" but my date explained that they'd talked beforehand, and this is what they felt comfortable with.

My hands suck for typing, but I'll try to help her as quick as I can because this thread is 14 hours old and you might already be on the date!  

Honestly what I'd suggest is that you plan ahead with your assistant and the coffee shop as much as possible so everything is automatic.  Pre-pay for everything, tip ahead of time, explain to the waiter before your guest arrives what would help you, maybe already have a drink going, etc.  That way it's just the two of you talking comfortably without interruptions for a bit.  I mean it's just coffee, right?  That way your assistant can sit in the corner and check his/her twitter, while casualty glancing over to you two hopefully hitting it off.  But, if you need them, have a signal, something timed, already planned out.  In the end this date is for you and her, and the truth is that you come with an assistant but you just want her to see you, and that's totally normal.  It's truly up to you how or when you convey that sensitive information, but I'd say wait until you want to or have to talk about it.  Whatever makes you most comfortable.

Visible disabilities may have very well been the reason your food was payed for, but that is only a glimpse of the context.

I think we looked like we were having a good time enjoying each other’s company and instead perhaps the person paying for our meal saw that we were lacking something. But reading through the other comments makes me think maybe they did recognize we were having a good time and decided to gift us precisely because of that? 

Of course your situation was different because you actually saw the expression on the face of your giver - so I guess you have less room for your imagination and more information from which to deduce her motivations - even though you still don’t know the whole story. It’s telling that such a good and useful gift also made you feel so conflicted - because now you looked needy to her instead of strong and rugged. Perhaps you looked needy AND strong and rugged to her. Still bittersweet in any case.",,,1,0,0,

The question and its primary focus in casual conversation implies that worth is tied to occupation. This is definitely a thing, in America at least. Social status is entirely dependent on your occupation and income, i.e. how ""successful"" you are, and your social ties which usually have a lot to do with the first two things. As a disabled person, I don't have any status from profession, income, or social network, and therefore I'm not worth knowing to most people. They'd never say so out loud, but it's clear nonetheless.

I don't have any clever ideas about dealing with this question. The choices are either lie or be honest, or something in between, which is usually where I go. Being completely honest is super problematic - people either ask weird and intrusive questions, or the conversation dies from awkwardness. It's pretty much a social lose-lose for us disabled folk.

I'm fortunate enough to have a part-time job, so I usually just go with that as the easiest way out. I just say I work at so-and-so place doing blank. They don't need to know that it's only a few hours per week. Then I ask them a question to redirect the conversation.

That's usually the best thing: ask people questions. People like to talk about themselves, and will almost always cheerfully take the bit and run with it. If you're asking questions, you're not having to answer so many that lead into tricky topics. Also, compliments work too. Compliment someone on literally anything, then ask a related question. Works great.

The first husband, I didn't have a clue what his malfunction seemed to be especially as his family took great delight in blaming me for his problems! Joy :(  . Only after I got out of the marriage could I look back and evaluate that along with several mental health issues, he was also very autistic. My son was born autistic and was different from the getgo (for those who insist autism is caused by vaccines). However, I noticed a problem with him and discussed it with the pediatrician and who got us in with a center that could help. It took a long time and I had to repeatedly remind myself that he wasn't 'normal' so when people insisted that 'normal' approaches would work with him, I knew better. I called it going through the back door or the back window, whatever it took. At 35 he lives on his own, supports himself, works a FT and PT job keeps busy partly because he hates being alone. He has achieved so much more than I ever expected, but it wasn't easy. He has worked hard for where he is at. One suggestion about teaching and helping to learn social mores and what folks mean and why jokes are funny, etc. For years he came over at least once a week and we watched Monk DVDs as well as King of the Hill and the Office. Just the two of us alone in the living room. If the soundtrack started laughing and he did too, I would stop the DVD and ask him if he knew why it was funny and what they were laughing or talking about, in the safe environment of just him and me, he felt safe to say he had no clue. So I explained the joke until he either understood it, or he could let his brain process it. But after several years he was at the point that even if HE didn't think something was that funny at least he knew why others were laughing. He also learned a lot about life in ways that weren't embarrassing, such as the episode on King of the Hill when the little girl got her period and Hank had to help her out. Something girls go through that guys have to have some understanding about and it gave us a chance to discuss the topic. Sorry, too long but I wanted to give an idea for those that are having trouble with some life skills, it was a non-threatening way for him to learn what he needed to and could be beneficial to others.",,,3,0,0,

I've never understood that attitude from disabled and non-disabled people.  Is a relationship really worth it if you're just settling?  Are you really that uncomfortable being alone?  I'm used to being alone, and in a relationship I require some alone time.  There's a thousand things I can do to entertain myself.  And I've got great friendships that don't require a romantic relationship.  I firmly believe that if you're not happy with yourself, you're never going to be truly happy being with someone else either.  I'm not saying you have to be perfectly happy with who you are, I'm not, but you have to be comfortable with being on your own before you can have a healthy relationship with someone else. 

That said, I can't relate from the female side.  I'm a male who was paralyzed from the chest down when I was 13.  I'm 34 now.  I know a few women in wheelchairs, we're not close, but acquaintances, and a number of them have found great relationships.  Mostly the ones who are comfortable with themselves.  From the male side, dating sites are hard whether you're disabled or not.  Every woman on a dating website gets flooded with messages from men.  It's obviously worse the more attractive you are.  You have to really stand out to get a girl's attention.  It's obviously not easy for women on dating sites either.  Men can be fickle and there's lots of creeps out there in the dating world.  

As far as my experience on dating apps/websites?  I'm no super model.  I'm not hideous either, but I think I would probably attract way more women if I lost at least 30 pounds.  That being said, I haven't dated a ton, but I've had my fair share of women.  It's more about personality than anything.  I find myself to be a bit on the socially awkward side, but have improved over the years.  Enough of my personality must shine through though as I've attracted a number of great women over the years who are never bothered by my disability.  I'm not trying to brag, but I'm also apparently a pretty decent lover.  My body is a train wreck and I'm less than generously endowed, but apparently I make up for it in other ways.  I had one long term relationship in my early 20s that ended for reasons beyond our control.  After that my life was pretty rocky for a few years.  When I got myself back together I had a few flings that lasted a number of months.   I eventually decided to try the dating apps.  Had a few good dates but nothing I felt comfortable with.  And then about 4.5 years ago I met a great and beautiful girl on OK Cupid.  We hit it off right away.  I've never been happier with anyone in my life.  After about 2 years of dating we decided we wanted to start a family.  We now have a 17-month-old daughter and we plan on getting married later this year.

I ended up having my first long term boyfriend at the age of 16 and we were together for 4 years, with plans to get married. Now the bad part about this was that I also grew up with the mentality that no guy would ever feel attracted to me, so when I met this guy who was basically obsessed with me, it felt like the most amazing thing in the world. This made me ignore some red flags and he turned out to be an abusive piece of shit towards the end of our relationship. My insecurity made his extreme jealousy feel like a blessing, but it was just a sign that the dude was psycho. So I guess you didn't miss anything.

I've had another two one-year long relationships that just didn't feel like something I could do for the rest of my life. I didn't see myself with any of them on the long term, but sadly my insecurities hit again and I just kinda... settled for whatever life threw at me.

Now for the first time I'm with someone I love madly and I know he has real feelings for me too and I'm just dreaming of our life and growing old together and for the first time it feels like what a healthy relationship should be life.

But as I said, we're both nearly 30 and I think this plays a huge role in the way we see life and the way we see each other. So don't worry about ""being old"", it gets better.",,,1,0,0,
21cd9282-724a-494b-b6c1-9eb9da02eca8,1557329788,"After my first really serious relationship I didn't think I'd ever have love again. I found someone and settled for a long time. I was lonely and desperately wanted to be loved, so I accepted being verbally abused daily, cheated on, constantly soothing her mood swings and outbursts.

 I figured that was the tax I had to pay for having health problems, not having much money, or a life outside of her. 

I didn't have friends, and had really low self esteem while I was begging for state assistance and my disability money. Weirdly, she was very jealous and paranoid about me fucking around or whatever. She got into every account I ever had with a password, and we just didn't have any boundaries between us by the end. 

Even though my world was very small and isolated, she was jealous. She didn't want anything to do with me once I got my disability, like she only wanted me when I could be tracked and managed, like I had been a kid with no pocket change to get in trouble with.

Don't just settle for whoever will spend time with you. I felt dread and resignation, wondering how I would have to try to patch up things enough for a whole day not to be ruined over her reaction to a text not being answered fast enough or something. Her issues with me and our relationship became so contemptuous that there was no working on it. She wanted to do stuff thst I can't physically do, and she resented me for it. She resented me for her power dynamic financially, for things she did for me that I wanted or didn't even care about like buying really expensive food I could do without. But when I got some financial independence, and was so happy to tell her how I wanted to do all this stuff with her, she actually resented me even more.

I still haven't figured it all out. I wanted to blow my brains out in December after the breakup, and a fall where I broke my shoulder, hand and neck. I got through that, and put myself out there again. My new girlfriend has emotional issues too, but she goes to therapy and all that jazz. And she's got a kid that comes every other weekend, and she's great. I was terrified of having kids when I was first disabled. Lately though having a little 7 year old bug around to take to WWE shows is really nice.

I tried Match, OKCupid, and even though I'm atheist, eHarmony. Naturally, I didn't really fit on that last one, so I gave up pretty quick. Match was just me sending out a bunch of emails and never getting *any* sort of email back - not even a ""Sorry not interested.""  


I stayed on OKCupid for a long time, mainly because it was free and it basically kept me ""in the game."" I went on one date with one woman (also disabled,) and it didn't work.

Ways I've met guys I've been involved with on a long term were online while I wasn't looking for relationships (started talking about whatever the common interest was and went from there), one at a concert, and one through a common friend.

I met my current and most meaningful partner in an online game, as trivial as it sounds. My point is, I never really *looked*  for a relationship, they just kinda happened naturally.

26 is not old. I don't want to be rude, but most young people (me included back when I was a teen/early 20s) tend to be shallow and only care about looks. It's with age when you realize that a relationship takes more than a hot person you get bored living with. A relationship is not just sex, it's sharing common interests, supporting each other, being able to have endless conversations and making each other laugh. Prioritizing personality over looks doesn't mean settling, it just means that you start overlooking some aspects. It also doesn't mean that you are not attracted to that person at all, there must be a certain level of attraction but that can also come with falling in love with the other person as they are.

It’s not because I lack the ability to do the job it’s because I’m not a reliable employee, and when you have to call out 3 times a week or can’t get an assignment done from an at home position because your body decided you no longer can read a computer screen, you’re going to get FIRED. and that’s going to make it difficult to get the next job, which you’ll eventually get fired from and so on.

Your job as a support worker is to assist with independence, it doesn't mean taking over but it also doesn't mean leaving your client to fight off a pack of wolves. And just because it would be quicker for a support worker to do something, doesn't mean that's helping the disabled person. One thing I am personally very sensitive to, is putting people out, but I have a right to take my own change in shops and to actually go around the shops myself. I've banned agency workers for suggesting it would be ""easier"" if I sat in the waiting area at the end whilst they do my shopping for me, and taking my change at the till instead of telling the staff to give me my own change after paying.

You can ask if you're not sure about something, but do it in a better tone than negative. Instead of saying ""Are you sure you want to do it that way?"", or ""Why can't you do it this way?"" ask ""Can I ask, why are you doing it that way?"" or words to that effect. You want the explanation to be on why they are doing it their way, instead of the emphasis of explaining why the way you want them to do it isn't feasable for them.

Also, if they're in an electric wheelchair, chances are they know how to drive it. Don't dictate where they should or shouldn't go or if they're not comfortable trying a certain space, your job is to accept that, not to force them and standing there saying ""I told you so"". I had someone do that to me in a shop with a narrow aisle. The end result wasn't that I got through the narrow aisle and everything was fine, the end result was that I hurt my neck checking the items my wheels were catching as I drove by weren't being dragged along. The person with me just saw my footplates and my arm rests and thought it looked like I could get through, despite me saying otherwise.

 It pissed me off because it was like she wasn't even willing to listen to me and was trying to prove me wrong even though she's not a doctor.

2b5a2a10-7179-4823-bdd1-cd3954c83fb3,1557446748,"&gt;  Ask before touching us.

Another poster already mentioned it but I want to emphasize that this includes staying out of our space and not touching ANY part of our medical equipment or supplies without explicit permission for that instance. Just because I'm sitting in a wheelchair, doesn't mean that I don't have the same ""bubble"" as everyone else. In fact, I need MORE room to be able to see my surroundings and safely maneuver my chair, which will sometimes kick to the side due to the movement of the caster wheels if I have to do something like switch from going forward to reverse. My service dog is included in this and is polite about being squashed but would like his own personal space, too.

This is something I had to teach my own parents, even, so I'm sure it's not instinctual to an able bodied person, but I need the wheelchair, the ventilator, the IV fluid lines, the dog, etc., to live as comfortably and independently as possible. They replace the function of some of my body parts, and my brain has learned to have awareness of where they are in space, so in a sense, they ARE part of my body. If you start messing with, say, my IV fluid lines, and accidentally pull too hard on the wrong end or make them sag so that they get caught in the wheelchair, you could dislodge the catheter that goes to my heart so that I can eat and drink, since my gut no longer functions. It's literally my lifeline, and there are a limited number of times that it can be replaced before they run out of veins that are big enough to use, at which point I will die from being unable to sustain my fluid and mineral balance (which will kill me faster than starvation). Similarly, I'm not FULLY dependent on the ventilator and oxygen yet, but I'm getting there. I've had years to figure out the best arrangement for all of my stuff on this wheelchair, so while I'm open to suggestions, don't assume that what you're about to do will work - there's a decent chance I've already tried it and it will result in tubing of some sort getting wrapped around the wheels. At home and in the car, I look like I'm not the most organized person, because there's mess, but I KNOW where things are, and things are located where they FOR A REASON. If you start rearranging and ""tidying up"" my stuff, not only might I have trouble finding something in a hurry, but I might not be close enough to something that I need in an emergency.

As far as pushing the wheelchair, hahahhahahahaha, the wheelchair alone weighs over 300 lbs. The only time that actually has an effect is if it gets a bit stuck, sometimes I can use the dog to stand to the side while someone else pushes with one hand while driving with the joystick at the same time. If you're not telling the motor/brain part of the chair to go, it's not going anywhere without several burly firefighters LIFTING it, which might or might not have happened when I might or might not have gotten too adventurous and gotten it stuck in the woodchips at a children's playground. Again, though, it's my personal space, and it is RUDE to lean on it, just as it is rude to lean on a stranger's shoulder without asking first. I can feel your breath on my head and neck, and can only imagine what germs you might be exposing me to, since my immune system is only mediocre. If I need to adjust the tilt or recline on my chair, or simply move a little to get a better view, it puts me in the awkward spot of disturbing you, which might mean that you spill your coffee down the back of my shirt, vs having to talk to you about every little change of body position.

Back to the dog, he's actually worth a greater monetary value than any of my other medical equipment, and also greater emotional value as a family member. It's also much easier to depreciate him by degrading up his training or scaring him, let alone hurting him physically. The former is a more incremental thing that is easier to fix, but if you scare a dog badly enough, they can create bad associations from a single event that make them permanently unable to work in public around objects or situations that remind them of the trauma, which means that they get retired early and the handler has to go without a service dog and have less independence while they wait 1-5 years for another dog to be trained. Imagine waiting multiple YEARS of your life to get your independence back after one asshat messed with your dog. A few of the large programs which train for common disabilities, such as guide dogs, will place dogs for free or virtually no cost, but for most people, you're also looking at thousands to tens of thousands of dollars. The full, unsubsidized cost of a professional trainer doing the job is in the low to mid 5 figures. Many people try to train their own and they may be successful but it takes TIME, energy, and some degree of skill. Even starting with decent basic training skills, the cost for me to spend hundreds of hours of my own time raising and training my dog, when you count up all of the expenses during the dog's training period, was close to $10K. Some people spend more because they need more help from a trainer or the first dog doesn't work out and they have to start over with a second one while also caring for the first one and dealing with any issues. There have been reported cases of people distracting service dogs to the point that the dog missed an alert for a seizure, diabetic low, or other event, which can have grave consequences for the handler. For example, with the seizure dog, if the handler is used to having 20 minutes to prepare after the dog alerts, but people are making kissy noises at the dog, petting it, etc., at the 20 minute mark, and the dog doesn't alert until the 10 minute mark, then the handler may still be standing/walking 10 minutes later, trying to get to a better safe spot, and may ultimately get a concussion or brain bleed from falling while walking. The consequences aren't as grave for me but you don't know from looking at someone. 

I am usually OK with letting people pet the dog because he's gregarious and it makes for good PR for service dogs, but only if they ask and only if I'm in the mood. There are times when it's just kind of creepy or obnoxious to ask to pet someone's dog, such as coming up to someone in the parking garage while they're trying to get things loaded up. My dog does not exist for you or the general public. He was bred, born, raised, and trained to mitigate my disability, and when he is with me, he is always being trained, because every interaction teaches the dog something, whether it's good or bad. Similarly, every interaction with another person or dog teaches him something, good or bad. I work hard to maintain his training and it's not always obvious from the outside what's going on. Even if I gave you permission to pet him last time, we could be working on something different this week, or he might be ""peopled out"" and in need of some quiet time without being disturbed.",,,3,0,0,

You're the one who referred to it as a ""spectacle to gawk and laugh at"".

2251c1bd-ad0b-46e6-b0a8-13eee80477b4,1557531973,"it's your assumptions that they are pointing out. we are hearing what you are saying, but you need to do so as well. IF those people assume the same things as you are, then that is on them. THEIR warped opinion of what is happening on stage has nothing to do with the performer's ability and desire to perform.  
  
it reminds me of the circus debates. when disabled people were told to not showcase themselves because it was ""debasing""... but if you talk to most circus performers, they would tell you they loved the work and it was empowering for them to show off their bodies proudly.  
  
the disconnect comes when you stop seeing the performers as people who can make their own minds and decisions. even if your intentions are good, to protect, by overlooking them as individuals you are doing the same damage, if not more, than the people who might ""gawk and laugh"". you're basically telling them that nothing good could come of what they are doing and it's better they stay hidden. i know that sounds exaggerated, but that is the bottom line of these assumptions.  
  
the truth, i feel, is that the GOOD that these drag syndrome performers are doing FAR out weighs any bad that could be slung at them. i think that it is very clear they are happier and empowered; and as the woman in the video says, anyone who sees this as exploitive is encouraged to go and see a show, or meet the people and hear for themselves how it makes them (the performers) feel. because THEIR opinion is the only one that really holds ground in any of this.",,,1,0,0,

Part of my distress is that if I don't find my own place I'll  *have* to move to Idaho with one of my sisters, over 300 miles away from everything I've ever known. I wouldn't get to come see my family here hardly at all because my sister will charge me rent and my Jeep only gets 16 mpg.

I was so excited when it was announced and made a date to actually see my parents (I am an adult) and watch the premire. We all laughed so hard. I honestly can't ever recall a time in my life that my dad laughed at TV other than this.

As far as I know I am the only one that continued watching past the first half dozen or so episodes but it really wasn't a show that could appeal to everyone and I think that, more than anything, is what hurt it. Not because there was a disabled character but it was a very specific kind of kooky, sitcom.

It also was hard to follow at times, example: of the 3 high school age kids one is at school, one is at home and one is wherever, oh and Kenneth (JJ's aide) he's not at school with JJ he's off with JJ's dad or whatever. Then after a commercial suddenly there's a switch and no one is where they were only to have it all confusingly switch back to wherever it was 2 commercial breaks before. I mean it probably wasn't that bad but I felt like it was...a lot.

If you told me 2.5 years ago I qualified for the Can Am U.S Paralympic Championships in the 400 free and 50 fly at my first Parameet I wouldn’t have believed you!! When my first pain management and neurosurgeon told me I would never swim again I regretfully believed them. They were right in a sense, I wouldn’t be able to train the same way as I once did, but they were also oh so wrong. They taught me how important it is for physicians to support their patient’s after a life changing injury or diagnosis, because for a year I believed them. That year I felt lost, like a core piece of myself was forever gone. It wasn’t until my freshman year of college I learned about the Paralympics and the opportunities they provide for adaptive athletes, and that needs to change! I was an able bodied swimmer for 12 years and never knew how the Paralympics are equivalent for the Olympics for adaptive athletes. I also wonder how many physicians, rehabilitationists, and surgeons don’t know also. How many other once able bodied athletes feel as though their athletic dreams are no longer viable? That’s why I’m a proud paraswimmer and sled hockey player, so others with disabilities, whether congenital or acquired, can see how it changed my life forever for the better. The water is so freeing. No worries of traumatic falls, no crutches slipping underneath you, no braces pinching your skin, no worries of inaccessibility! Finally I want to thank the coaches, family, and friends who have been supportive of my journey, I love you all so!

I got priority boarding and was able to slip through security pretty much in a heartbeat compared to everybody else. I suppose it should be mentioned that I'm a C6 incomplete quadriplegic who uses a manual chair. so I was able to board the plane in my chair and transfer to a seat pretty easily. Honestly the biggest problem with the  whole trip that I encountered was a shower chair. I didn't want to spring for the normal ones I get as I would just be staying for 4 days. So I dropped like $60 on a Walmart commode / shower chair.... in hindsight probably not a very good idea as it gave me a pressure sore almost immediately.
But back to the plane I think it would be a pretty easy fix just have one or two rows in the front that's a little bit more accessible. It's already got pretty good legroom but it could use armrest that get out of the way and a little better seats as far as the cushions go. But all in all I had a really good experience with it.

1. Don't be afraid to be rude. Honestly the only thing that gets some people to back off. For airports, go way early and if someone pulls shit literally tell them they are being inappropriate, unprofessional, and you need to speak to their supervisor. Go up the chain if you have to. You can get them so much bad publicity that you will hit someone who will do something-- especially following him into the bathroom. 

2. Get pre-approved for airport security. You can check the website or call and ask but basically there's a fee of like $50 normally and you get exempt from some of the beaurocratic bullshit. 

3. [This person](https://twitter.com/JohnLZHC/status/1014498513651228672?s=09) sells sleeves for wheelchair handles that are covered in spikes so random assholes can't grab them! They slide on/off so might be useful to bring on your next trip. 

4. Sounds like your boyfriend may not be really into confrontation, in which case... Respect his wishes and keep your head down. If everyone else is treating him like trash, it becomes even more important for you to respect his wishes and agency. 

Do what you can to prevent problems by calling ahead, pre-screening, fighting out accessibility stuff. Ask him how he wants you to deal with confrontation and then do that. He may care more about getting through as fast as possible instead of fighting when the same thing is going to happen next week with different people.

You might want to print this out and bring it. Circle the part about baggage assistance in red. Then you can insist that nobody push your boyfriend's chair but you, so you can set the pace, and get a little help for yourself by leaning on the chair. 

If you find them trying to push you beyond the limits of your invisible disability, make it visible. Yes, I'm saying you should limp. Ham it up. You have a right to be helped, they're not getting your words, so give them a visual cue. You're just using their own preconceptions against them.

As for unwanted ""help"" from buttinskis, I would like to say that tees and/or signs like ""DON'T HELP ME UNLESS I ASK YOU"" or ""ONLY THE MARIANAS WENCH IS AUTHORIZED TO PUSH THIS WHEELCHAIR"" would help, but people are stupid and don't read. 

You might request that your DH's power chair get a Gate Tag. This means he can stay in it all the way to the gate, and transfer directly to the aisle chair torture device. Then they have to bring it to the gate when you arrive. It will mean you're waiting around a long time. But if he just sits in his seat on the plane until it gets there, nobody can drive away with him and he can carry his own stuff. Maybe even ride you on his lap.",,,11,0,0,

I have cerebral palsy, chronic pain and a few other issues. I am more mobile than your significant other and less mobile than you from your description.

People rarely automatically see my cerebral palsy for the disability that it is. When I was a teen young adult and could walk without help sometimes people wouldn't see any disability or guessed my CP affected speech was deafness or intellectual disability. 

Now people see me with my cane and speech issues and more prominent eye issues and think ID with some physical problems. 

They can talk to me inappropriately and assume I am incapable of taking care of myself or that I know what's best for me.  

I have to shut that down and stop it from happening if the context of the situation is important. If it's just some meddling person I ignore it.

&gt;A security guard recently told my husband that he was a “smart little buddy” because he was walking with his crutches.

This is something I would ignore if I was having great day or thought responding would slow down/screw up my day. I might respond if I felt snappy and didn't care about being kicked out.

The mess with the airline and/or airport staff needs to be reported. No one should be trying to help him in the bathroom without his asking or taking his wheelchair handles or separating you. 

u/WildNW0nderful has GREAT advice. I agree that you too should ask for wheelchair transport. Those porters are scary fast.

We had an issue where he did not want to schlep the luggage and would prefer to push me because its like holding hands, but the airport helpers always want the reverse. They don't really listen to him, so its my job to advocate for what works for us. ""Can you help me carry this bag?"", ""I feel more comfortable with my husband pushing me."", ""Please let my husband push me."" etc.

Now, if its a big airport and its a connection we usually let them push me because we need to hurry and don't know the way. If it's not possible for you to hurry, maybe you should request a wheelchair as well. Airports are exhausting even for people without disabilities.

People are always hoping I can walk just a few steps or trying to grab me during transfers. It's important that the person with the disability be clear with them, if they are able to communicate, which it sounds like your bf can. ""I can't stand or walk at all"", ""No, I cannot remove my shoes."" I find the best strategy to avoid unwanted help is to give them other tasks. ""I'm fine in the bathroom on my own, but can you watch this bag?"", ""I can transfer on my own. It may not look pretty, but I'll get there. Can you hold this wheelchair steady?"" ""I don't need help getting into the car, but can you open the trunk and clear a space for my crutches?""

Sometimes I have to raise my voice. ""Please stop."", ""Don't grab me."" but if that's what it takes to be heard and treated the way that works for me, then so be it.

As for the strangers offering advice/commentary, like about the purse or walking with crutches. Ignore them, or just say ""Why would you say that?"" or ""Wow, that was a rude thing to say."" and move on.  You don't have to laugh along with or agree with stupid comments.

EDIT: One other thought! I didn't realize how much the helper pushing me and just jogging ahead while he was stuck with the bag was hurting my husband's feelings.

Here’s my suggestions but I want to say on your behalf it’s ridiculous that you are forced to alter who you are. 1. Don’t carry a purse, use a backpack or something that looks unisex and hang it across the two handlebars on the back of the chair, I have carabiners too in case that’s the easiest quickest way to attach bags, 2. Use a child wrist strap between you and the wheelchair if you have to turn your back, keeping the strap on prevents someone else pushing the chair at a rate you can’t keep up with too. 3. Consider how you are dressed, I have no idea if you were dressed in beach attire or business last time and not saying which look you should go for but just keep in mind it affects first impressions. If you and DH have matching baseball caps or both look business formal or have on the same hoodie it visually suggest you are a couple, eliminating most of the caregiver questioning.  You could wear huge screen printed Matching t shirts that state WE GOT THIS. Back the Fuck Off. 4. Do take time to get everything you are traveling with cleaned up and shiny.

Those people were mistreating you and your husband, I can't see it in any other way.

I can only imagine how hard it is for your husband and how much of this shit he's already taken that he just got used to it. I'm frankly not worried about confronting other people so my mindset is probably very different from yours, but my advice is to speak up for yourself.

Plant your feet on the ground. Raise your voice, if need be. Explain loud and clear what the other person is doing wrong and why it's wrong.

It would be a different story if people were committing mistakes while being kind and receptive and really willing to help, but those things that happened were ridiculous. People were already making a scene, so go into it and make yourself clear. They'll probably not change their minds ( some people are just rude and stupid), but they'll change their behaviour towards you or at least leave you alone.

I've had people try and pull me out of my wheelchair 'because I'm obviously faking, and there's nothing wrong with me'. I have chronic pain, polymyalgia, hEDS, osteoarthritis and thanks to a brain injury nearly 5 years ago, anterograde amnesia, traumatic epileptic seizures and migraines. Like you, physically I look fine. Absolutely tip-top. On good days I can walk a little bit while wearing knee supports, usual days I'm either in my mobility scooter or have someone pushing me in my wheelchair, and on bad days I can't even get out if bed. So on my usual days (wheelchair or mobility scooter days), I might be in more pain than usual, but I've still got a strong right hook, and have punched people that have tried to pull me out my chair.

So yeah, cards are a lot less confrontational. Being disabled, you have to advocate for yourself, with EVERYONE, and it's gets boring, tiring, and humiliating, but it has to be done, you can't let people take the piss. If someone is trying to lift your husband up, don't say anything, he needs to be the one to tell them to fuck off. If someone doesn't believe you're his girlfriend and helper, he needs to tell them to piss off and mind their own business. Politeness obviously hasn't worked for you, so time to change tactics.

I realise this post sounds really aggressive, but I'm so pissed off today, I'm stuck in bed having a massive pain flare because someone tried to pull me out my chair tomorrow, and while I smacked them, the force they were using to try and yank me out, to 'prove I was faking' has really hurt me, so I currently have no sympathy for people who don't listen to what we say, or assume we're lying because we don't look obviously disabled, so fuck the lot of them.

You'll get better with experience.

This is something you really have to communicate with your partner about, though.  I understand that both of you are disabled, but it seems like he is the one on the receiving end of most of the bad behavior.  Since this is the case, what's important is how he wants things handled.  There can be a fine line between standing up for him and overruling him.  

**You said he's resigned, but I'd like to propose another interpretation**: for me, after 20 years in a wheelchair, some days it's easier just to put up a wall, mentally, and let things slide off my back, rather than getting upset over every incident...because if I got upset over every incident, I'd be angry all the time.  It's a form of personal protection.  He also has had a lot more time than you to process the idea that some people just don't get it, that some people are jerks, and that some people are just ignorant, and this is the way the world is.  To you, this is relatively new.  The anger is fresh.  Try talking to him about how he deals with all this -- he may have some wisdom to share that helps you deal with the frustration you're feeling.

Believe me, the first few years I was in a chair, I *was* angry all the time...and I was right!  I *was* being treated badly -- and I still am.  But after a while I realized that I couldn't stay angry all the time (or didn't want to), and I also realized that people weren't going to change.  So, now what?  I had to change how I dealt with it.  That's all I could control.  I learned how to be assertive instead of aggressive, how to speak up, how to vent to loved ones when it got to be too much.  Some days I still get angry, but it's lessened.  I'm not going to tell you that people are going to treat you better, because it's not true.  You'll keep experiencing this.

 I just found out in an audit my lawyer did about the amount of backpay the state of Connecticut was willing to pay, that the government basically fraudulentently took away 13 months of evidence they had in order to short me backpay money. 

I filed two disability claims over the first 6 years I became disabled, but I was crazy and alone and didn't do it right or advocate well enough. But they also disregarded the first 13 months of ""this guy is profoundly disabled"" medical docs from when I put in my third claim. 

My disability lawyer is a really good dude who still does bono work even though the state literally took away all the funding for the only non profit disability legal aid firm in my immediate area. He kept doing it even though he had to wait list people for years. He was just another legal aid place I applied to over the years when he took my case. So he orchestrated my third disability claim which got me through finally, he had put in all the documents on my behalf. 

My lawyer emails me out of the blue recently and asks if I'm OK. Again, good dude. I have brain damage and I'm bad with money and numbers, and I get embarrassed about it. But I said hey, I think somethings wrong with my money but I don't know what exactly.

The audit goes down and gov claimed they had never gotten those docs. My lawyer was incenced. He had copies of the docs he sent and he was kinda grandstanding in a good way, saying like 'hey this guy has a ton of problems and doesn't even have a home. He doesn't have a filing cabinet, what's he supposed to do if he didn't have someone to advocate for him and catch this.' He was legit furious that we had to go up to fucking Hartford to resolve this problem that's at best profound gov carelessness and at worst deliberate cost cutting sabotage jobs on society's most vulnerable 

For poor people, and or people without a family support system, the disability process is designed to grind you down. To overprocess you, scare you, force interminable wait times on you; all with them knowing how hard is is to get rides or even just sit in lobbies on hard plastic chairs for hours. 

For poor people, the safety net is designed to get you to give up, kill yourself, whatever.

My testicles are part of my disability. 

It took me 8 years, and my testicles are disabled. 8 years of going to appointments with people who have authority over my my ability to live as a member of society instead of living on the fringe in purgatory

I am still waiting for my own documented housing (8 years) because I am still technically homeless. 

I get 14 dollars in food stamps. 7 hundred something dollars to live on now, at least before I had my job. Cool, how far does that go in Connecticut? 

Now, I finally got a job, with a disability program to employ us through federal aid, the only institution that has a process to hire someone as unemployable as a 31 year old dude with tired eyes and nerve damage in his nuts, and no family or roots in the community. 

I fought for this job, and now I see why, because I do not belong here. I literally am a crazy bum with clearly physical disabilities waltzing in doing work, in a program designed for nice white married ladies with depression who want to copy edit or write some stuff in a feminine environment. Every one of my disabled coworkers is not a peer, they are older and have homes and they and their families have lived in the area for generations. And I don't belong there, I just need this job because I need money, because I am homeless and I am desperate to have a bed to sleep and its all mine. And I make these ladies feel uncomfortable and sad, and have this passive unspoken resentment that I'm even there changing their mood in the room even though I'm polite and smile and am doing the nice diplomatic office worker bee routine, we all know I don't belong.

I either have to eat my lunch alone, or eat with my coworkers, these ladies from around the Greenwich CT area, and mingle with these ladies - - in my government program that uses tax money for disabled people who need a job on top of their disability benefits while not losing SSDI; this program I waited and fought to be apart of-- knowing I'm the reason everyone stops talking about their gardener fucking up or their husband only booking a domestic holiday and getting awkwardly quiet while I sit down. 

At times, spite is the only thing that keeps me going. Knowing that the state of Connecticut definitely wants me to kill myself. That they have pretty much challenged me to do so. 

The fact that I often DO want to just give up and kill myself is sometimes the only thing that keeps me from doing it. Like fuck you everybody, I'm sticking around. I fantasize that if I do it, I would find a Governor's mansion or something and slit my wrists on the stoop and write ""MY BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS"" on one of the pillars. Then I think that's a bit melodramatic and I should just die in a hole alone in the forest where no will ever find me. But no! That's what they want me to do! So I fall asleep thinking about revolving this thought process most nights, and wake up and just do the insane unstable unrealistic thing and just keep going. 

The ""losing documents"" thing happens to us so often and with such egregiously suspicious circumstance, that it reeeeeeeally seems to be an official policy of letting us know where we stand. That society doesn't want disableds polluting the safety net and getting any help unless you're cute enough to get presents from Ellen. Every time I correspond with the government by mail, to once again beg for the ability to survive, and leave alllll the bubbles blank that indicate I have two solid feet in society, like having assets or a home or family members...

Here is a link to information and instructions from SSA about filing an appeal and waiver request. [https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-632.html](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ssa-632.html).

Under law SSA applies annual averaging to net income from self employment for SSI purposes, including deeming spouse’s income. See 20 CFR §416.1111(b) [https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/cfr20/416/416-1111.htm](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/cfr20/416/416-1111.htm).  When you initially reported the income, the representative should have, ideally, explained the annual averaging of net earnings from self employment rules to you.  Also, when you initially reported the income SSA should have applied an estimate of net earnings in determining the amount of ongoing payments. See [https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.NSF/lnx/0500820230](https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.NSF/lnx/0500820230).

In filing an appeal and request for waiver, you can detail efforts to report the income and to reschedule your appointment.  It may be helpful to have specific dates and any documentation or verification of contacts with SSA. If you have receipts for documents submitted that is usually very helpful, and anytime we submit documents to SSA in person I recommend requesting a receipt.

It sounds like you may have set aside some SSI payments after you started receiving additional income. By SSA’s rules, they will want you to send that money back to them. Often when you do have money set aside to return that is helpful in getting any remaining overpayment waived or in negotiating a lower rate of recovery.  If SSA alleges that your overpayment exceeds the funds you set aside to return to them, you can specifically request a waiver for the remaining alleged overpayment. If SSA declines to waive the remaining overpayment, you can request a reduced rate of recovery, and you might be able to negotiate a low or very low monthly repayment amount. 

The largest national Social Security policy advocacy group is the AARP. There are also disability rights advocate programs in each state, and here is a tool to find your state’s disability rights advocate program.

d0d4be64-a550-443e-ac4b-255d418ab00c,1558109036,"Back in college, it took me begging for help prior to getting notes. My school would ask people via a bcc email to take notes just before the class began. Once it took:

- DSS staff  visiting the lecture hall  
- a request from the professor  
- DSS director visiting the lecture hall  
- a second request from the professor.  

After there was no volunteers for almost a week, the professor did a third. I requested to speak. I said something like ""the various requests for a notetaker are for me. I cannot write, I cannot type fast enough to take notes during the lecture. There are three ways you can take notes [which I listed here]. I don't care which format you choose. We are 4.5 weeks in, we have a test late next week. I have zero material to study off of, other than the textbook. Can anyone honestly say they are confident that they could pass the test under those situations? Please let me know if you'll help me.""

After that, somebody stepped up. IIRC the notes were really bad. 

I had a notetaker once who would write their notes, and mine. There's were in-depth about the topic, mine were fragments of sentences. I forget if they were the person  who volunteered above or not. In both cases, taking notes on a computer was not done often (early-mid 2000s).",,,1,0,0,

I was able-bodied as a student, but I have several psychological disabilities (Asperger's, C-PTSD, chronic recurrent major depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety are the main diagnoses).

I was always good at school. I got excellent grades without trying and teachers loved me. On the other hand I was a complete social failure. I loved the ""school"" part of school - if I could have avoided lunch and recess, it would have been heaven on earth for me.

When I went to college, the only institutional barrier I ever experienced was being required to live on campus with a roommate the first year. I knew it wouldn't work but at that age didn't know why, couldn't explain it to the dean of housing, and didn't yet have much in the way of diagnoses and medical history to back me up. After six weeks of living in a tiny room with a stranger, I was very close to a complete mental breakdown, and somehow I managed to convince them to let me move into a single room. Living in the dorm was still challenging but I could manage that way.

Aside from that, I was extremely fortunate - at the two schools I ultimately attended, I had amazing, supportive advisers who were understanding, compassionate, and helpful far beyond the call of duty. The disabilities support staff and my professors were always lovely and helpful. I never had an accommodation request refused, although I didn't really have many requests. The biggest problem for me was depression that just wouldn't quit, and the cognitive effects associated with depression and anxiety, and there wasn't much they could do to help there.

My point is, even though I was lucky enough to have a natural aptitude for school AND amazing help from the colleges I attended, I barely graduated. Disability can be such a huge barrier in and of itself. If a student doesn't have support from every corner, education can be damn near impossible.

And now in my 30s, I have a very expensive but useless piece of paper. Even though I value my education for the way it developed me as a person, I'm on Social Security Disability because I simply cannot maintain a full-time job. I work a limited part-time schedule because the routine and getting out of my house each day are very beneficial. I have six figures of educational debt that I have zero prospect of paying off, and a degree that contributes nothing to my earnings potential. (Before anyone suggests it, I can't get my student loans discharged because I'm not disabled enough. There's a very strict standard for that in the US. And even if I could get them forgiven, it would be considered income and I'd have to pay taxes on it which I can't even begin to afford to do. So I'm on an income-based repayment plan with tiny monthly payments for the rest of my life pretty much.)",,,4,0,0,

I'm not really sure if my adhd/ocd falls under this category, but at work, I needed one day at my job(amazon delivery driver) to basically sort out their absolutely broken system as it comes onto my truck, in regards to apartment deliveries(which can be substantial depending on the route).

I needed 1 day.  I told my manager I was going to be behind.  I didn't bring in my issues, because they, in my opinion, just going to hold you back, and if your issues, like I said, are not easily considered, you better fuck right off.  

I needed 1, fucking day.  Amazon calls my manager, and tells me I am behind and that I need to fuck off ASAP.  I try and tell him I just need 1 day on being behind.  1.  He tells me to fuck off, and quick.  He literally tells me I can't do it my way.  and that I have to do it their way, even though it is clearly fucked at present.

Now, sure, I could say, hey I need this accommodation.  I will literally resolve the issue myself, just give me a day.  No, they say.  presumably because fuck me I'm a slave and fuck you.  I actually know why but why bother explaining, this is a extremely reasonable request, and i'm not even going to explain further.

I could take them to court(I'm sure that would work.)I might win, I might not, but if your thinking of taking your rich corp to court, might be time to fuck off.  Esp if your poor.  I live in a right to work state, and amazon would prob hire Columbine guerrillas to kill me and my family, or turn me into a battery or something for the rich.

I ended up having a panic attack later that day, over the state of it all, my first!  Firstys!, and almost got arrested by the police who showed up, before I got seen by the EMT.  I had to do a drunk driving assessment test, essentially, to prove I wasn't on drugs.  It was like I was an elephant at the circus.  I guess with how many people they murder every year, I should consider myself lucky.  Me and the young officer got into a bit of a spat over the issue, and honestly all the issues stated above, I know it's not really his fault, but the individual has to answer for the shortcomings of the collective from time to time, unfortunately.

What is your disability, what is your doctor even doing to help?"" I didn't have answers, I was still trying to figure things out myself.

But the biggest issue was transport. My uni didn't have housing. I couldn't work *and* study so a private/share house rental wasn't an option. I had to stay with my foster family in the suburbs. Which meant catching the train into uni every day, and home again every night.

That would have been fine except the workshop started at 7am, we had a long break from 4:30-7pm, then ran from 7-11pm.

The first accessible train got me into campus at 7:15 last train home for me was 10:55, I was constantly being written up for my attendance and lack of worth ethic. The solution the uni offered me? ""find a bed in a backpackers hostel on weeknights. Don't go home during the week""

I was told I was not allowed to nap on campus during my long break.

My main workshop teacher was the main reason I managed to stay 2.5 years. He let me nap in his truck which was parked opposite the road so it technically wasn't on campus, and he'd drive me home some nights when I was missed my train. He'd push the numbers on my attendance as much as he could because he could see that I was doing the work, I wasn't lazy, I just wasn't there.

But when it came time for the uni to insure the students to begin an industry work placement, they told me that until I had a diagnosis I couldn't be insured, because anything could happen.

I deferred for 6 months.... Knowing full well I couldn't return because my course was being grandfathered out, my year was going to be the last ever year.


It worked out in the end though. My diagnosis turned out to be incompatible with that course and job prospects.

Trying to get an appointment with disability services is problematic and the office isn't even in a readily accessible location. While the disability officers will put a plan together for your reasonable adjustments, getting them to actually implement them is a fucking nightmare. If you need a notetaker or accessible course materials, be prepared to wait the whole semester for them to actually be provided to you. You end up falling so far behind the ablebodied students it is ridiculous. Academic staff openly discriminate against and bully students with disabilities and nothing is done about it. They refuse to implement your reasonable adjustments and you have to fight tooth and nail to get them to do it. Once they are finally forced to implement them, they punish you for having reasonable adjustments via your assessments. I have been told ""disabled students get too much special consideration"". 

Then you move into physical access, so many classes missed because the buildings and walkways aren't disability accessible (I have paraplegia among other health conditions) while they block off disability parking bays for their own uses so half the time you can't even get out of the fucking car.

My point is that the decision is complex and differs with each individual situation. You are drawing a line in the sand somewhere. That is why you cannot legislate abortion. 

Society does nothing but look down on those of us who are in chronic pain and illness from birth to death. Many find that society tries to take away pain relief upon adulthood and label them as lazy drug addicts. I do think that one of the things that sorts the disability community on this topic is the subject of chronic pain. Being disabled without pain and illness is a very different experience. I've lived in fear of pregnancy - it would be life threatening to me and a fetus *and* the fetus would have a 50/50 of inheriting my condition. Under abortion if a mother's life is in danger - you can only do so when the mother's death is imminent - not when you know the pregnancy will endanger her life at a time when it is medically easier to do an abortion. They want us to wait until she is already weak to undergo what will be by then a medical procedure. This is how women died in Ireland. This is how an Indian national died in Ireland and one of the things that prompted the lifting of the abortion ban there.

What do you do for the family facing the birth a child that has such severe disabilities that they will not be able to make decisions for themselves later in life? Who will be completely dependent upon the adults in their family for life? We, in the US, simply do not provide enough support to families of children with disabilities in general - much less ones where the child will never grow to be an independent adult. Republicans continue to want to cut Medicaid- which provides support to some of these families. Frankly, we need disability supports to be separated from medical insurance (which is what Medicaid is). Families go bankrupt, people with severe disabilities end up abused and assaulted and unable to communicate that fact, parents end up unable to parent children they already have and other issues galore that we provide little to nothing more than pity and ""thoughts and prayers."" I cannot judge parents' decisions in the reality of today's society. Too many people fall into cracks of not enough money to provide supports and too much money to qualify for subsidy. When we, the society, provide those supports and treat people with disabilities as *people* worthy of support - we can then argue over whether we can set a society wide line.",,,1,0,0,

(there are dangers leaving a dead body inside the pregnant woman to hold til a natural birth).

Dobermans were bred as protectors, it's in their genes to protect their owners. And I personally don't like the German shepherd breed; I like to look at them, but I don't want to live with one. I'm an active person, but also like to have my days where I stay home and have my quiet time. Dobermans are good for people who are both athletic and quiet, like me. So the breed is a good lifestyle fit for me. Dobermans do better with other pets that aren't dogs, too.
I'd hazard a guess that most people who would be dumb enough to harass me with a full grown male doberman standing beside me, aren't smart enough to know that kicking a doberman's rib cage can do some serious damage.
Emma, the doberman/rottweiler I had as a kid, she was more doberman than rottweiler. She was an absolute sweetheart until someone messed with her family, then she'd get really aggressive. I'll never forget when this group of drunk guys followed us home, I was around 5 years old at the time. When Emma saw them she tore her leash away from the tree in the backyard, ran to the front yard barking and growling, and my dad had to grab her leash and hold her back cause she would have jumped on any of those guys and tore apart their faces. Dobermans bite like a pair of scissors, they don't hold and shake like German shepherds. Their bites are also worse because they aren't puncture wounds, so a person can bleed out if a doberman gets them good. So that's basically my logic as to why I prefer dobermans.",,,1,0,0,

Reasons the video wouldn’t increase the good in the world:
1. People with disabilities may be offended by the video 
2. It doesn’t help the stigma and prejudice against those with disabilities, since this is a large form of exposure able-bodied people have of those with disabilities. The representation of those with disabilities is so narrow, and this type of video doesn’t help. 

By your reasoning, seeing this kind of content can result in more stigma/prejudice, as well as internalized issues that come from only seeing “your group” in videos like this. 

I agree the people who posted this didn’t have bad intentions, and I haven’t seen anyone comment on this as being numerous. But sometimes good intentions can have negative effects, and I think that in this case, there are good reasons for believing that this video isn’t helpful or good to have floating around on the internet for able-bodied people to be amazed by. 

On your last note, I want to emphasize that the issue is the video, not on people being ungrateful or critical.

I've technically been disabled since I was five, so I don't really remember life before that. I've seen some home movies that make me kind of sad, though.

I did have to be tutored at home the first half of freshman year of high school, so that was hard. I was the new girl in January when all of the cliques had already been formed.

I started my own company out of my home 20 years ago since it wasn't possible to be full-time employed somewhere else, and I only had to stop working and go on disability about five years ago, so depending on how much your disability has affected that part of your life, maybe that's why we have different perspectives. Since I knew from the beginning that I wouldn't be able to work until retirement age, I worked really hard to make the company kind of self-sustaining. It's still running, just on a smaller scale, and only keeping the clients that employees can work independently and directly with. Basically passive income.

I’m in pain all the time. Muscle spasms that sometimes *hurt*. Lhermitte’s/“electric chair sensation”. Headaches. Spine pain. Nerve damage. Muscle pain. Inability to run. Balance issues. Disorientation. Numbness. Fatigue. Cognitive issues (memory loss, memory issues, speech issues). I also have the glorious chance of upgrading to MS. 

I do get in places where I get emotional. *Why?* but, unfortunately, I don’t get to know the answer. I get to look at everything this taught me about myself. I am stronger than I ever thought. More ambitious than I ever thought. More dedicated than I ever thought. I **never** give up. I would never have known any of this without going through my disease. Sometimes, I wish I didn’t have to learn it this way. But that’s life. I look at it as I can beat myself up and get angry at it, or use that and volunteer. Use that and better myself. Use it as fuel to keep going since I already made it this far. 

Yes I have weeks where I can’t do *anything*. I get mad about it. But then I have to remind myself that I am not the same as I was before and that’s okay. I am still *me*, just have to be more gentle with myself. 

It is so hard. Especially if you have a “before”. But learning to accept the new is hard but vital. Otherwise you will be upset and angry all the time. I’ve somewhat accepted my new limitations. I still get upset. That is human nature. Therapy is a good idea as well. It’s traumatic. You’re able to do more things then all of a sudden... you can’t. It is very traumatic!

Everyone will believe ""life is unfair"", they were dealt a ""bad hand"". It's all the same - we're selfish when it comes to our own pain.

The **ADA** defines persons with disabilities as individuals who have: (1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities; (2) a record of **such** an impairment; or (3) been **regarded** as having **such** an impairment. You seem to fit within this category, with or without any ""confirmation"" from a neurologist.

&amp;#x200B;

In order to get workplace accommodations, you aren't required to provide ""proof"" via medical documentation; some might ask for some, but many will listen to you, especially if you mention that you've been visiting neurologists for years and describe the symptoms you experience monthly. Certain states may require it in order to use vocational rehabilitation services. For an employer, you can talk with them about your needs and what a ""reasonable"" accommodation would be (that doesn't change the fundamental nature or duties of the job). These are usual no-cost or low-cost. For you, it might mean flexible scheduling, ability to work from home, etc. A circumstance doesn't have to be chronic to be disabling.

&gt;An employee with disability can be paid a percentage of the [national minimum wage](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/Dictionary.aspx?TermID=2030), depending on their assessed work capacity. For example, someone with a work capacity of 70% will get 70% of the national minimum wage. Work capacity assessments need to be carried out by a qualified independent assessor.  
&gt;  
&gt;Employees can't be paid less than $86 per week.

&amp;#x200B;

An additional issue here is that it's a percentage of the *minimum* wage, so the starting point is already much lower, then cut again depending on their work capacity. Often this results in people with profound physical or cognitive disabilities having their own baseline minimum wage, mentioned above a $86. 

Presently I am working with a young man with cerebral palsy who makes $86 a day, while I make $200 for working with him. He works at a hardware store chain. In situations like this, it's impossible not to see the exploitation in play. He isn't employed to work at this store, he's employed to drive his wheelchair around in uniform and make the store look progressive for customers.",,,2,0,0,

They perform menial jobs like packaging candy or constructing holiday cards. It is not uncommon for employees to be mistreated or condescended to in these environments.

As for why they're paid subminimum wage, the pervasive ideology is that they only have partial able bodied function and are therefore only entitled to partial able bodied wage. There are, at least in Aus, actual tests performed in workplaces where a disabled employees performance is compared directly to an able bodied employee. For instance, if a disabled employees job is to return misplaced items in a store, they might be timed while returning a set number of these items and then have their time compared to that of an able bodied employee. If the disabled employee takes longer, it is legal to pay them a percentage of a full wage.

Funding came from the state through Medicare waivers, and we would accept losses to support a mission of giving everybody the dignity of a work experience.

I'm not going to lie, getting paid  $14 for a 30 Hour Work Week sucks balls , but when I think back to the people that earned that little , it was a lot of people who needed full physical assistance to do simple piece-work jobs... sometimes needed to be spoon-fed their lunches, and needed personal care assistance

They had a workshop where he was able to make a small amount of money via piece work while he was training. He learned to work with power equipment in a milling shop and manufactured things like wooden crates and stakes used in construction. He didn't make much but it taught him what it was like to earn a small wage and it was a huge incentive for him. Within a few months they got him a job close to home where he did end up making minimum wage. What it did for his self esteem however was amazing.

Not sure what your prep is but they gave me two empty jugs with some poop powder. Had to fill the jugs with water, add the powder, and drink two glasses of it like every two hours the day before the procedure. Sorry, the procedure was almost exactly three years ago so my memory is a little fuzzy. All I know is that about 10 minutes after you force two glasses of that stuff down your throat you go and crap your brains out for the next 30-45 minutes. Man, what an awful day that was. It’s obviously not the end of the world, but it’s a full day of being buddies with the toilet. And the stuff you drink doesn’t taste bad, but after the first round your body and brain know what it means and as soon as you start drinking it they both cry for what comes next. 

Make sure you do it though. You want your colon to be as clean as a whistle when they put that camera up your butt. My fiancée is a surgical tech and she’s had to help on similar procedures. For your sake and the sake of those performing the procedure, get that colon clean!

Because of that, the doctor recommended that he do the colonoscopy at a surgery center where they were more able to handle wheelchairs. It was no problem; they were able to push my wheelchair up to the table, which was lowered to the right hight for me. I transferred to the table and the procedure was done. The nurses there were very used to people in all sorts of physical conditions having many various procedures done, so they were very able to help me transfer.

Working with people using wheelchairs, on ambulance gurneys, etc. was routine for them.

The prep was no problem. I did not feel bloated or sick, so there was no need to walk around. Actually, the instructions for the prep didn't mention that.

I had colonoscopies twice before I was in a wheelchair. Except for the transfer from the wheelchair to the bed or table, there was no difference.

As for anesthesia, the first time I had only light anesthesia. There was some discomfort but not too much. (not as bad as a teeth cleaning or dental work). The next two times I was ""knocked out"" and could not remember anything from the procedure. Frankly, I would just as well not have anesthesia.

Midazolam and fentanyl is one combination used for light sedation. Midazolam is a short acting benzodiazepine that will make you not remember, mostly, the procedure. It lasts between 1 and 6 hours. It will make you loopy. Fentanyl is exactly what you likely think it is, an opioid. It’s for the pain **you will feel**. It lasts up to an hour. You probably won’t even notice that it was part of everything. 

They use other combinations, but that’s common. It’s what I had. I couldn’t cross the street and I felt like mashed potatoes with butter. I told people that several times. 

I’m trying to impress this upon you because it really does hurt. The bowel doesn’t feel pain except when it expands. They blow your colon up like a balloon to take the pictures. That’s **the** reason for the pain the you will, not maybe, feel. 

Obviously, if you get a choice to not have the medication then it’s all you. I’m not trying to be a jerk or anything. I just wouldn’t want to go through the pain, myself. The situation is stressful enough and I’m a delicate flower.

e0aaa745-47b2-46c5-85b2-fff334054a7c,1558719456,"SEF's Mom - The thing is, SS was never meant to replace a person's whole income, even their retirement income so that when a person retires, they are supposed to have some retirement savings saved up and that SS would be a supplement to that. Unfortunately, SSD (not familiar with SSDI as I believe that we 'make' too much!) can't be called upon before a person has had a chance to save any money by working. I was fortunate that when I became disabled I was in my mid 40's and had worked as a nurse earning decent wages. So I dropped from what I had been making to 1/4 - 1/3 of the amount that I had coming in. It doesn't help that the so-called COLA in no way represents the increase in the COL!!! I think we went something like 3 years without anything getting  COLA since I guess, poor disabled folks don't have to pay for the same gas or milk or food and utilities that everyone else does as we automatically get a discount to whatever our COLA should really have been. In 2017 our COLA was for me exactly what my increase in my MC premium was, so still no increase. 2018 We got a puny increase and the MC premium went up again so what should have been a $27 increase became $2 for me a month! 2019 I got an increase and MC premium only increased $1.50/month and so I had $37/month increase after 5-6 years. In the meantime, those folks making the rules in Washington are making $174,000/year. Apparently, they haven't gotten any raises also, but they do get perks and other things and I didn't have the time to figure that out. In my research such as it was, I found that in California the poverty level for a family of 4 if something like $80K!

&amp;#x200B;

In my state, the minimum wage has been $7.25/hour since 2009. They talk about increasing it, but nothing has been done. Whether with the amount of MC in the amount that I get or not, I am still below $9/hour based on 160 hours a month. I was fortunate in that I was married when I became disabled although at this point he is kaput himself. He is self-employed and since he can't work, not much is coming in from his side. We do what we can but as I look to the future I know we can't afford the home we live in since we can't really afford it now other than the mortgage being low, the taxes, heating, and cooling are ginormous. We run a small online business that is under his name and brings in some help in paying on bills as well as letting me tuck some away into retirement accounts. I've always lived pretty frugally as did he so that is something that I am used to. I will be reading the ""How to Be Poor in America"" that has been mentioned. I remember reading a book written by a single woman in how she was surviving as a retired woman on her own and having a decent place to live. She packed a lot of good advice into the book, such as near holidays when relatives may be racking their brains trying to think of what to buy this old woman, she would put a bug in their ear that she needed a new coat. A couple of months ago I walked into a thrift store and this coat caught my eye. It was my size, looked to be brand new, and was exactly what I wanted in a winter coat. Cost me $7 and will probably last me the next 20 years or till I die since I am already 63! 

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning on checking out what things we are eligible for currently. Every time I checked before my husband's income took us too far over the income bracket to get benefits. It would help if we could at least get SNAP. If he could be declared disabled it would mean an extra infusion of cash but I want to hit 65 first as then I will no longer be technically disabled but retired as how SS looks at it.

I manage by living illegally with my partner (I'm not supposed to live with an employed partner when receiving disability payments. But we are financially independent from each other, we split rent and household bills so I don't really agree with that law) we live in an area with a high crime and meth-abuse rate so rent is low, but it's still 60% of my ""income"". I'm fortunately eligible for 10% discounts on electricity due to having a recognised disability (Blue Concession). But my lifestyle is that of a broke college student while all my peers are advancing in life.

I work 4-6 hours per week, Usually my disability payments are reduced by ~$25 a week because my 4-6 hours of work puts me over the limit for what I can earn while receiving a disability support payment.

I've been assessed by my GP and rheumatologist to safely continue 4-6 hours work and they said that until my condition is better managed I shouldn't push for more. But the welfare office's independent assessors have said I am capable of 15-22hrs per week. If the welfare office had agreed with my GP my payments would increase by 50% (If you can't do 8 hours per week paid work, they pay the equivalent of $16/hr) That rate sounds much more reasonable in my current health. But I love my job and If I could somehow do 15 hours without fucking up my health that would be enough for me, it would be the equivalent of $11 per hour full time because I am paid well per hour in my current job.",,,3,0,0,

30c5b634-d237-4b27-a37f-e32a3fd44a4f,1558652482,"Yes.  I think I realized this when I was put on disability over ten years ago.  I knew it was poverty and I knew I would potentially never work again like I used to.  I have worked part time since then, but only sporadically in a few jobs, all low paying.  I was on the section 8 list for a very long time; the exact length of time I can not be sure, but at least a few years.  I have lived in group homes and other situations; my parents never really wanted me home, since I developed a dependable on them anyway, and they were kind of jerks, I won't lie.  

Poverty is no joke.  What I advise you to do is find some way to occupy your time.  That has been my main problem without steady work and transportation, is just that I lie awake at home all day doing nothing but play video games and listen to music, imagining what I could really be doing if I had money and a car.  Right now I have less than 300 in my bank account and rent is technechially due in the first.  My rent is 1/3 of my income on section 8, and without section 8 I would not be living in my own apartment.  

There have been a lot of hurdles, but I somehow made it; including an overdose where I broke my nose and wound up in the hospital and then group home for over three months.  This has never been easy, I won't lie to you.  Find whatever supports may be able to help you and stick with them - not just people you drink or get high with, but real friends; or at least someone who can help you, even if that person is a therepist.

Learn to divide your money and live frugally.  If you work on SSI, you should realize that they take away .50 per dollar you make from your SSI check.  That information helps because it informs you on how much you should work and how much you can earn.  You should also realize that you rent will go up while working and receiving section 8.  So these are kind of like benefits, but not much really, because they have to account for every dollar that you make and they will make you pay it back no matter what.  If you need to stockpile some cash money, I say you should do so, because the government can't keep track of that.  Buy a safe or lock box and never claim it on your taxes or in any social security statement.  Honestly this might be your best option. 

Being on disability leaves us with very little options.  The government lies when they say a person can live off of $800 a month in social security.  I understand I don't want to be a burden on others, but that should not leave me at their whims.  This society is crap.  A society that requires large amounts of cash to really survive should at least have some socialist spending.  It's not just you or me who are broke these days.  The problem is pretty systemic.  Check statistics.  I hope I have at least given you some good advice.  I don't think I can necessarily answer many of your questions, but I hope I can help.  Living in poverty is no joke, all I do is sustain myself physically, but not emotionally, that's why I drink beer.  I hate to say it friend, but welcome to America.  It wouldn't be the same under any other situation.

With Parkinson's we loose those fine motor skills, but can place a dot on paper. It's the striking motion that allows the movement.

When I asked her how I was supposed to move myself about the airport for the next hour and a half if I was in an aisle chair she seemed confused that I actually wanted to get food and have a look at the shops while waiting for my flight to board (and basically rolled her eyes when I said if she made me use the aisle chair then I'd need a staff member to push me around as the only other option would be for me to crawl)........at the end of a very long story she spat it and marched over to security and within 30 seconds got the 'approval' she needed and I got to continue on my trip",,,2,0,0,

It’s not choice to me.  Death isn’t even in my vocabulary.  Everyone seems to think this is courageous or heroic or ____ insert whatever word necessary.

The bad days are just trials... and it’s because I know the joy of good days.  I don’t get envious or jealous of others... I get jealous or envious of what I might be able to accomplish if I was back to normal... which then puts me in a mindset of “how do I use what I have at my disposal to even my playing field”.

As for the therapist, I think it's important to establish that you have been seeking help regularly. If you have a medical history to look at, that goes a long way. If not, it might raise a red flag. I had years of doctor visits, surgeries, medications for my physical and mental ailments when I filed my appeal.

I workout with a bunch of friends in a Boxing Gym. Boxing, core work, yoga, work up a sweat and keep those muscles moving. Four levels of classes, from wheel chair users to able to walk/run. All of us with Parkinson's.

So couch arranged for us to have a fun workout and learn some skills from some of the boxers in town. They were told non-impact, but just for us to go through the same drills. Lords Gym in Austin, TX has been around for ages.

So the staff thought it was fund raiser for Parkinson's. They couldn't grasp the fact that no every ""boxer"" who signed up had Parkinson's.

We had a blast, it was fun, everyone was laughing. That was great to bring the two groups together. I don't move fast, but can through a good punch. Helped to understand the mechanics of hitting so you don't hurt yourself.

Every so often we have ""guest"" work out with us. My best complement was a weight lifter he said he thought he as in great shape, but had to sit down after 15 minutes, was ""you are a beast!"" 

The more intense my workout, the more I work out, the longer I can delay the progression of Parkinson's. It's not easy. Some days I'm just not able to walk no leave the house, other days I am out for a 5K run. I'm living in two worlds.",,,3,0,0,

ccb3fb93-e321-4429-91b8-3bd113b37f9c,1559235579,"I’m always on the lookout for a product like this, VERY interested. Here are some practical concerns I think of when I’m looking at products like this:

— braking system. I can’t tell from your description whether brake from ‘handles’ means you can brake from the levers or have to use the wheels. Obviously there wouldn’t be enough time to let go and grab wheels.

— reverse. You would think this would be obvious, but actually it comes from first hand experience. The best feeling (from a shoulder/exercise perspective) row wheelchair I ever tried was actually an unusable device because it didn’t go in reverse! It was made by a well-intentioned non-wheelchair user who didn’t fathom why that was a dealbreaker. I guess he never tried rolling his own invention up to a table 

— lever release position. Speaking of tables, the release position you have in the diagram—the position you can move the levers to to get the out of the way—is so so. Personally I wouldn’t be able to use that because it blocks side transfers in and out of chair. And it looks like it would get in the way of rolling under tables. You might want to study some similar products, like wijits (they are levers, but they don’t row). Their release position is to swing back. It’s less compact looking since it’s not folded down, but it’s actually more out of the way.

— lever position in general. Those levers seem awfully far forward. I’m a little skeptical. Remember to try your product out on smaller people, not just 6ft tall men!

— installation/portability. A lot of these issues don’t have perfect solutions and this is certainly one of them. A lot of trade offs. But a major consideration of mine is whether this is an add on to my chair that I could somewhat easily remove, or whether I’m stuck with it after installation. And if I’m stuck with it, how many parts of my chair does that impact and can it travel well? Wijits again provide a good example, though this time not in their favor. Wijits have an extremely annoying installation feature. Manual chairs in general have a standardized quick release for their main wheels. But wijits wheels, at least my 5 year old pair, have a different connector. This has to be installed on the axle and makes the chair incompatible with normal wheels. There’s no easy switching between wijits and normal wheels once you install them. This feature is made more problematic by their poor travel robustness. Airline travel with wijits is dysfunctional, because there’s no way to secure them. A point in favor of your release position is that it looks secured, which is helpful. My ideal (imaginary) product would either be a set of wheels with attached levers that pops off quick release style so I could pop in normal wheels, or modified wheels with easily detachable levers with the wheels working like normal when I detach levers.

— gears. Not a dealbreaker for me, since it seems like there is a built in tradeoff between gears and weight and I like lightweight too. But gears are awesome.

— price. Actually, you have a great price range.

— Demo availability. This is obviously a hard one for a small new product. But I mention it because it’s the number 1 reason I haven’t obtained some similar products. It’s just very hard to determine whether I can use a product until I try it. There is this national ‘Abilities Expo’ (if you’re in US) that is one way to get product out there. Or if installation ends up being easy, letting people try and return could help.

Anyway, these are just some considerations. No product can tackle them all! I hope you update us on this product! Definitely interested!!",,,3,0,0,

00f29e61-c452-41bf-b67b-bb63985c21b4,1559227104,"I'm a manual chair user, so here's my perspective:

1) Disc brakes: Yes, please, especially in wet conditions. Not having the brakes linked during two-hand operation allows some steering as well. Thumbs up. However, what happens if I'm pulling and I need to brake, which happens all the time in real life. I'd need the pulling handles to operate the brakes as there isn't time to drop the handles, grasp the arms and apply brakes.

2) Pulling: It's not clear if there is any gearing involved. There better be as pulling near the hub is going to take so much more effort. Perhaps make the hubs bigger so that there's more mechanical advantage. Also, the positioning of the arms needs to be adjustable so that they can be placed at your natural arm extension, so you get the maximum pulling distance/range. I like the idea of the arms folding over the big wheels when not in use.

3) Width: A wider chair is going to be a problem. In the UK, there is an assumed standard width of chair and everything is geared to that. It means that those who use current bariatric chairs have problems navigating the world, so a wider ""standard-size"" chair may not fit into the gaps any more. So how much more width are we talking about? If it stops me using public transport or using accessible toilets, then it's a no-go. Also, would the arms be strong enough to survive the multiple impacts they're going to get from mindless pedestrians. If people keep bumping into the extended arms there's a lot of wear and tear where the arms meet the frame.

4) Weight: If you're going to attach arms to the chair then the basic chair structure needs to be able to cope with the new stresses. Does this mean that the weight of the chair needs to increase? And would the material of the chair need to be stronger, titanium instead of aluminium? Would that increase the cost of the chair, even before your device is fitted?

I'm not trying to be negative, just practical from my point of view. I'd love to have something that meant that I could look where I was going when going uphill, instead of leaning forward and looking at the ground. I'd love to have a way to brake in all weathers without wearing holes in my gloves. Indeed, I'd love to not need gloves when using my chair. So anything that looks promising is worth considering, and your device has promise.",,,7,0,0,
f671ab75-3ffa-4227-8d69-45af4f967e4b,1559222313,"I believe there’s an adaptation that does this already. However it’s built into the wheels. It’s rather large and adds to the overall width of the chair. 

Not saying don’t do it, absolutely work on it. Make it better than what’s available now.

As this example shows, your bodily autonomy only extends to the point that it  doesn't impact others. Current norms are that you don't have to help them, but you do have to not actively harm them.

Actually I looked it up, it is *only* in the case of active, contagious TB and the side effects are not permanent. It is only in the case where a person refuses treatment and to avoid contaminating others. The biggest thing is the lack of harm of treatment. The percentage rates are lower than the harm pregnancy can cause. We don't talk enough about the actual physical dangers of pregnancy. Probably because we don't want to scare people away from it. But that lack of knowledge affects things like the abortion debate.
Pregnancy is much more akin to donating an organ. Women's bodies are changed, often damaged (check out how often women who've carried babies wind up with incontinence issues and/or pelvic floor collapse. The US has the worst maternal death rate of all developed countries. You cannot be compelled to donate an organ  (or even a piece of an organ) even if it will save a life.

I cannot morally force someone to produce a child that is going to cost more time and money than they have (this is true even if the child would be perfectly 'normal"" and healthy) and would take away from other children already in existence.   


In the US we have no solution for child care, medical costs, and then when the family is bankrupt helping with housing costs. You have to fight tooth and nail to get your child an appropriate education. Family Medical Leave Act barely provides protection to families with chronically ill kids and it too is under attack. Too many families have to depend upon the charity of fundraiser events and GoFundMes. There are other social safety nets that we lack.   


Saying that they should save a child for adoption ignores the fact that most kids with disabilities in the state's system never leave the system. It doesn't change the fact that it is legal for prospective adoptive parents to deny a child if they are born disabled. (if they have a contract with a pregnant woman to adopt her child, they can change their minds if the child is not perfect).  Then what happens? A mother who is incapable of raising a child at all gets forced to do so? A child with disabilities is thrust into the state system?  


Yes, human lives are worth more than money. Our \*society\* says they are not. Our society says that if you are not rich and powerful and white and healthy (and male, and straight and Christian) you don't deserve all the things life can offer. We need to change those attitudes and change the attitudes towards people who need those safety nets. The way to do that is \*not\* through forced pregnancy.   


I agree that is not good that the first instinct is to abort a potential child with disabilities. Again that is the fault of a society that does not support families like ours.  Forced pregnancy is not the answer. Also realize that when you abort in the first 3 months you are ending a potential not killing a person. The things that make a person a person are not present that early. Being alive is not enough to be a person. Sperm are alive, plants are alive. Late term abortions are another can of worms so I won't go there for now.",,,8,0,0,

People will be less inclined to abort children if they believe their children will be happy and that they will be practically and emotionally prepared to provide for them.

OTOH banning abortion is dangerous and unethical.",,,21,0,0,
