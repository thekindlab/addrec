Take those findings (and your knee) to a new doctor and see if a fresh set of eyes can come up with an idea. CRPS/RSD is a possible culprit Essentially what that is, is that your 'reflex nerves' are signaling your body's hardware to say there's an injury, and your body's hardware responds -- like if your Check Engine light could trigger your engine to repair itself, and then it got a faulty signal, it could make your car blow up or something. It's not a psychological thing at all, it's like a signal feedback loop in your actual nervous system. Skin changes, swelling, and redness all fit into that bill (doesn't mean you have it -- just means get a professional to look into it). That pain can also get in the way of physical therapy, which means that solving the CRPS (if it's there at all) might help you solve the mechanical knee problems without further surgery.",2,0,2,0,0,

89e3983b-cbb1-4d91-b868-5af461d89983,1431276053,"First I want to say that I think you're having a very normal reaction to a very abnormal situation. Your parents should be helping you become more independent now, at this important time of your life (young adulthood!) and not stringing you along with promises and maybe-laters. I get survival mode, but unfortunately life still goes on in survival mode and from what you've said (very articulately!), your parents appear to be hindering you at every turn. 

First off, finances. YOU need to be in charge of your money. You are a capable adult, and it's time for your parents to give you your money. Since they can't be trusted to give you a straight answer, I suggest getting in touch with social security. They have an online chat but what they can do online is limited. See what they can do to help and explain your communication needs. You need your own bank account so you can use PayPal and manage your own finances however you like. It concerns me that you parents are only giving you a few bucks a month. 

Second, education: I'm like you and did better in classrooms and with focused instruction. I tried a coursera course once and it was almost as good. It might be worth it to try coursera or EdX, where there's lectures and homework, and it's free. Plus there's interacting with other students via message boards. 

It also concerns me that your parents won't make your home more accessible. Portable ramps are an option, and something you could bring with you if you move. But in any case, being kept prisoner by your parents (whether it's deliberate on their part or not) is very unacceptable. Your desire for independence is normal and reasonable and it's infuriating to me (a complete stranger) that your parents are dismissive of your needs. 

If you have a department of rehabilitation in your state, it might be worth calling them to see if you could work with them by phone or email. The one in my state is a pain in the ass but they will pay for home modifications that fit your needs. (If you're going to move soon, they could give you portable mods you can take with you. Including power chairs and accessible vans, along with ramps.) their whole goal is to get you employed. 

I wish you the best of luck. My heart goes out to you. You are a very articulate and intelligent young person and this world needs more people like you. Keep pushing!",3,0,3,0,0,

I've never actually been to a bank. Parents talked about setting me up with a checking account and debit card--after we move.

The good news is the friend above set me up with a joint bank account through an online-only bank when I was 18. He pays $8 a week into it, and $5/hr if something comes up with his business that I can help with. He wanted to get me used to having/handling money, and I use it to pay my MMO subscription(s) mostly. I have a PayPal account as well, but not much incentive to use it besides website testing, when I can just input the card and use it instead.

The issue with the online bank is that it's not easy to get paper bills into the account (friend has suggested to just mail the money or use a mail order, or PayPal. There's also a feature where you can photograph checks to make a deposit, but if the money was sent to my parents' account to hold it (so it could be deposited to my online account) they'd be a bit leery of the ""technology."" 

Wiring is an option but my parents' physical bank charges 25$ a transfer, which deterred me from doing it monthly. It might be worth it for larger sums though.

When I first started to have to face facts about my disability and call in an occupational therapist to help me with my job I heard this bullshit way too much. 

I was working as a rigger,  but I was losing strength in my muscles due to muscle fatigue and I was requiring crutches or a wheelchair to mobilise. 

I thought I was going to be coached on other career options of things I like to do and physically can do.

Instead I was told about all the ways in which a wheelchair user can still be a rigger.  I was given different tools and shown how ropes can  be used to allow my chair to be used in a lighting grid.  For those who are not following along, my occupational therapist suggested I hire a rigger to rig a rig for my chair so that I would not lose my job as a rigger.  The OT must have been thinking ""look at me,  I just got two people into the work force for the price of one""  meanwhile,  any employer in the world is thinking ""why would I hire the one in the chair and an able bodied rigger when I can just have the able bodied one and write just one pay check""

Here's my advice for you regarding the SSI issues:

1. Call the SSI office for your state and explain your situation (other posters have given more detailed info regarding this so I won't repeat it here)
2. Contact a program like United Cerebral Palsy (UCP) or Vocational Rehab (Voc Rehab). They can help with things like getting a ramp and a vehicle.

Regarding Your Emotional State:

1. You're justified feeling the way you feel given the situation you're in.
2. To help improve things in the here-and-now, I would try and do some exercises. I understand that your hands and upper body are limited, but you can still exercise with resistance bands (arms), grip strength trainers, and (my favorite) silly putty. Seriously, play with that stuff for extended periods of time while you sit at your computer and it'll help with hand coordination (pull it, stretch it, make it into shapes, etc.)

3. Never forget that you live in the future :D The magic of the internet means your can reach out to people and organizations willing to help you from anywhere in the world. No matter where you are, you have a community. 

Other notes:

I've been in the SSI trap. It sucks, but ultimately it's better for you to get steady work then depend on payments from SSI. There's a ton of companies who need copyright work and there's good money in that. Google around and you'll find something. Maybe there's a disability blog that would pay you to write or edit for them. Put together a portfolio of your work and post it online. 

A Final Note About the Exercise Thing:

I'm super serious about the exercise thing. You know what one of the main killers of people with CP is (beyond stuff like infections or ninja attacks)? Fucking heart failure. Seriously. If you want to see 50 you need to move around. Even if it means flaying your arms in a circle with weighted wrist-bands attached. If it means getting your heart rate up consistently, do it.

You have a choice: You can banish your fear - push through it and become something - or you can be consumed by it. You're already desperate enough to reach out to strangers for help and advice. Keep pushing. You can do this. Imagine the house is on fire and drag your chair off the front of the goddamn porch if you have to. ",1,0,1,0,0,

My advice would be to make sure you have all the medical records you want entered into evidence ready and submitted 5 days before the hearing (you can get them entered after, but it will slow down your decision time); that you should be consistent with your earlier applications and complaints (i.e., if you're going to say that X condition is much worse or more limiting, have the medical records supporting that it's got worse); and lastly, be as honest as possible about the extent of your limitations.  Oftentimes, people will try to exaggerate their disabilities.  If a judge sees someone who has done their best but is not capable of working, in my experience they're much more sympathetic than they would be to someone who hasn't put forth a good effort (shirked physical therapy, hasn't made an effort to work, has not seen or tried to see appropriate specialists), and are therefore more likely to approve.  

Finally, if the judge is biased or prejudice, appeal it.  If there is evidence of bias in the transcript/recording, it will be appealed by the appeals council.  They take bias and procedural errors very seriously.",2,0,2,0,0,

Or better yet, there's a whole online community full of people with weird bad knees that can explain the concepts better -- check out http://www.kneeguru.co.uk/KNEEtalk/

The ten-second version is, everybody's knees are ever-so-slightly different, because your hips, femur, tibia, ankles, and patella are all 'not perfectly straight' in slightly different ways. This is not usually a problem, but an injury (even a minor one) can screw up that alignment. If your kneecap is sliding a milimeter left of where it used to, you'll be able to tell because it hurts -- and no one will be able to see that on an X-ray or MRI, because those are stationary images and the problem is related to motion. There are treatment options available -- kneeguru's consensus is that ""Lateral Release,"" the first thing most doctors want to try, is *really bad* (my own experience backs that up, but that's anecdotal). Other better options exist.

HOWEVER.

The skin involvement can also point to CRPS/RSD, which is a nerve dysfunction usually triggered by injuries (even minor one), or the surgeries to correct them. That's typically a burning pain. It does **not** explain the popping/clicking/mechanical pain, but it can coexist beside ~~real~~ **STRUCTURAL** (edit: crps is extremely real) problems and throw a wrench in the whole treatment plan. You want to talk to your primary doctor about seeing a pain specialist so they can look at that -- and you want to do that soon, because if you let it develop, CRPS/RSD is **bad news bears**. 

So, your checklist should be:

1. Make sure you're keeping up with prescribed actions -- if there's PT, do your exercises, if you're supposed to be resting and icing, rest and ice, take pills, etc. 

2. Talk to your doctor about alignment. If s/he doesn't (or can't) address those concerns, get a referral to someone who will or can. 

3. Get in a pain management program, possibly through your orthopedic surgeon, but possibly through a PCM -- not sure, but get there. They can treat or rule out CRPS, and also they're the ones typically best suited to making your daily life less painfully miserable.

4. For further explanation/commiseration/community/advice, the kneeguru people are a great resource. It's frequented by people in your situation (and those who've made it out), and also several knee specialists.

I haven't been told the above line (re:getting put in a home) in many years--that was a staple from my middle school days in which my parents were trying to enforce their standards for chores and such. Things such as not organizing my room and so on.

I'm not entirely sure what the root cause of it is, but my dad seems to have a distrust of the SSA/the government, claiming that they will ask many, many, many questions, require the filling out of oodles of paperwork, and generally screw people over the tiniest things (eg, having a roommate.) I don't know to what degree this is true, because I've never dealt with Social Security myself. But, the sheer complexity of it scares me, which is why I've avoided doing anything about my situation for so long.

I grew up on learning to fear things like home inspections, which I was told would happen if I were to live alone. As a child I was pretty ignorant due to being so isolated (think The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, but with a wheelchair instead of a cult background), so my independence level was low.

I operated, and to some degree still operate on a thought process that requires a clear and obvious reason for doing something, else nothing. I had no reason to so much as pay attention to my room because nothing ever happened within it. But, if given a clear and obvious reason to clean it (besides ""because we said so""), well, I would do it. If given accessible resources, I probably could demonstrate competency, or at least the ability to learn, for whatever criteria the government has. But, then, and even now, I have no reason to want to do things, because I'm stuck here.

My parents mistook my thought process for apathy, and as I've said in other replies it's hard to communicate on a high level with them. I suppose I have some deep, underlying fear/hate towards them, but that's beyond the scope of this post.

Things are better now, or at least my parents act like it--they harp on me a lot less. But my dad still has a fundamental inability to realize how screwed up my mental health is (he does, but puts it on the same level of his own, and he's content to stagnate until the future while I don't have the same tolerance.)

Before I called the office, my dad actually went over my benefits with me; he brought the bank statement into the room. It's a combination of disability (not sure if SSI or SSDI, he just referred to it as Disability) and survivor benefits from my birth mother's death. I was surprised how low the disability was.

He also mentioned that they can reduce or raise the components of the sources depending on certain factors (like whether I'm on my own or have a carer) and that was confusing. So it seems the presence of survivor benefits impacts how much disability I get.

It does appear to be that the money which should go to me is, in bank terms, in my name--but I've never been to a bank, so I never knew. I don't even know how I'd take it out and use it.

I'm looking at the Ticket To Work program, but am afraid of having to report wages (how?) and how I'd get healthcare.

What I really want to do, regardless of any money, is GO HOME. I would forego all benefits and work my ass off if it meant getting to live in Olympia. However, it's unrealistic to expect the government to help with that--if I get a job here, how could I also get another job there?

I know a little about HUD and my dad has told me about the waiting list. He has said that when we move, if I choose to get my own place, I would want to get on HUD as soon as possible for the first year (during which he would help acclimate me to the outside world, navigating the city, etc.)

Driving is another issue for me. I don't have a permit or license, and I don't want to get one--the prospect of driving seems dangerous/difficult, not to mention I get carsick very easy the few times I do get to leave home.",1,0,1,0,0,

That was actually in an even earlier stage of the injury were walking was hell. I am still in a better place than post injury (like right after it), but my right knee is actually carrying all my body weight which will be unhealthy in the long run. Eventually it'll get to tired. (And if you sort of compare by holding both joints you'll find the muscles around the right knee to be over done, that's because I am compensating for the other leg with it).  I already had a crutch in the earlier stages of the injury. Doc claims I had an acl torn, and a meniscus injury. Acl tear showed on the scan before now it doesn't so I am thankful for this. He claims that both AcL and meniscus are now fixed (according to MRI) however what I think is maybe my acl somehow got partially healed, however I don't think my meniscus injury is healed and I think that's where all the problems are coming from (Something is definately moving and shifting inside, and I am betting meniscus, however for some reason it's not visible on MRI) that's all .x. The muscles around the knee ofcourse are not happy, and the meniscus itself still hurts (as if it just got reinjured) the level of that varies from day to day. The site of injury still hurts when you poke it. (it's the upper right side of the knee in the boney area). Sorry for the excessive detail. (I never got the operation done because I had commitments and was emotionally incapable of handling the operation, when I was freshly injured, however now the doc claims that I don't need one. I understand this maybe it's good news but I'd like to just be able to walk without feeling pain, and without my knees clicking (the clicks actually generate pain).

SSI has a different income restriction than SSDI.  SSI takes away money on a 2-for-1 basis (that is, after a certain amount, for every $2 you make they remove $1 of benefit. it's to encourage people to try to work).  

HOWEVER.

The situation becomes weirder when it's not the recipient who is bringing in money.  I think [THINK! do not take this as gospel!] that money you brought in would be treated the same way as if she got a job - she'd be getting income from ""rent"" you paid.

That said.  SSDI also has a limit, you can't bring in more than $1090/month (at this time) of outside income.  The limit is hard; anything more means you are suspended from SSDI.

I suggest that you or your mom needs to talk to the SSA about this. I'm pretty sure that if you were paying, say, $500/month in rent that any ""hit"" to their SSDI or SSI would be negligible, at best.   But I'm not an expert on this, so I cannot be sure.

The first time I reconnected with this friend, shortly after he'd begun using a wheelchair, he flaked on me for three months before I showed up on his porch one day and wouldn't leave. We've been close ever since. The process of helping my friend find his spark for life again has required a lot of pushiness, but the tough love and lack of pity always came from a place that loved him and believed in him. If you are a true friend to this guy, don't let him wallow forever. 
Though my friend will sometimes revert back into a depressed state for a few days or a week, not leaving the house or cleaning his room or caring about life, I must stay patient and remind him that I won't ever just give up on him and leave him alone. 
Hold your friend accountable if he bails on plans or mopes around; give him a reason to try. Living with a disability, particularly using a wheelchair, is a tough road to hoe, but there's no reason your friend can't lead a full and wonderful life. A person who's wheelchair-bound that never leaves home can't inspire anyone, but there is something really attractive and awesome about people with disabilities who are confident and happy.

And they don't try to accept or accommodate me either. What's worse, though, is that they are just really uneducated about disability and will ask me questions like ""Why do you want to be disabled?"" and ""When people ask what's wrong with you, what do I tell them?""

This is essentially the person who takes financial responsibility for the person and manages their money. This is done in situations where someones medical conditions (mental retardation and psychiatric disorders mostly) would make it too difficult for them to be manage their funds on their own. If she is your payee then she has a very wide latitude as to how to appropriate your money and while SSA does have some accountabilty measures as long as you are living in the same household with her it is difficult to prove mis-use of the funds.

Does she have a job or other source of income that could explain where the money is coming from? 

If you do not want to ask your mother directly, you can call the SSA main number (800-772-1213) and they should be able to tell you whether she is the rep payee for your benefits.

I became disabled in my 20's, not teens, but something that comes up for me periodically is grief. Grief over loss of abilities and hobbies I used to have, grief about things that I had hoped to do but never will, grief and frustration about how effing HARD things are sometimes when you're dealing with a whole layer of crap that other people don't contend with just to live their daily lives, etc. There is at least the implication in society, or in some parts of it, that people who are disabled are supposed to be grateful for everything they CAN do and everything they have. You're not supposed to 'waste time feeling sorry for yourself' but just pick up and move forward. Processing negative feelings and normalizing them by sharing in a group setting might be useful for some people.

And I thought I might arm her with info on how this violated his rights to help get them to now help him with the next steps.  It clearly violates 34 CFR 300.117 of IDEA if he had an IEP.  But how would this fall if he, goodness forbid, didn't and they just pushed him through after his injury?

I spent over a year with almost no income while waiting to qualify for SSDI, and the next two years with only SSDI for income.  This is what helped me keep my head above water.

Your household needs a budget.  Get them to tell you what the major expenses are.  Rent/Mortgage? Insurance? Car payments? Electricity and/or Gas? Water? Sewage? Taxes?  Start paying attention to the grocery bill receipts.  See what money goes where.

Then start a basic budget. Google spreadsheets will do.   On the left, list each expense.  On the right, have one column of ""expected expense"" and one next to it for ""actual expense.""  If you want, you can make it so you can have multiple ""actuals"" that add up into an ""actual total,"" then set both actual and expected up to total at the bottom.

Then you can start seeing where the money is going, and where, if necessary, you need to either cut back or supplement.

Hint: This is also good for conversations like, ""You know, we spent $500 last month on ciggies.  That's enough money that we could go out to eat twice a month and still have some money left over.""

589f63c3-bad5-4542-ac39-e0e5a5dc6591,1431030244,"FWIW - At the start of the last economic crisis in the US, the number of claims for SSDI &amp; SSI shot up very quickly. The main reason for this appears to be that disabled people were now competing for jobs with the non-disabled, and often, perhaps due to the myth that disabled people ""cost more"" to employ, the non-disabled were getting hired first.  Suddenly there were far more disabled people unable to find work. 


A lot of these jobs were lower-paid positions taken by people who had once been qualified for different work but now weren't able to do it, which technically makes you qualified for SSDI.  (If you had been working as, for example, a computer programmer but become blind, you might then change your job, but by SSDI rules you are ""no longer able to do the work you were trained for."")

Because of this the backlog for cases grew just as fast as the application pool. Things are better, economically, and its becoming easier for the disabled to find work, if they wish and can. But it's going to take time for the backlog to clear out, and while it's clearing there are still more people applying. It's kind of a ""3-steps-forwards, two-steps-back"" thing.

As for the fact that some people cheat and game the system -- that's been a problem since humanity existed. There will always be people who try to get around the rules.  I firmly believe that karma will get them one day, whether they come up for review and someone notices that there isn't more than a form saying, ""Yep. Disabled."" or something else. ",1,0,1,0,0,

- Issues around self-esteem both in terms of learning to accept and love your body and in terms of learning that you have intrinsic value as a human being despite what society might tell you.

- Relationships and sexuality, that they're ok, that you can have them too and how to be comfortable and safe in them. 

- Coping with the enormous levels of anxiety that we have to face when trying to gain independence. Sometimes I felt like I was juggling far too many balls at once and I was very overwhelmed straight out of high school so preparing for that. Perhaps starting to talk about what resources are available and how to access that sort of thing.

- Finding out where you stand in the disabled community and understanding what disability means to you on an emotional level. For a long time I wanted nothing to do with the disabled community or issues around disability and I discovered over time that my reasons for that were more about my own insecurities than anything else. That's not to say that all people who want nothing to do with ""the community"" have insecurities about their disability but I personally just wish I'd had the chance to talk about it and process my thoughts better and be told that I can choose to live my life however I want to. For example, it's ok to want to advocate for disabled rights and it's also ok not to want to. That whole process was really confusing and difficult for me and I still feel like it's a contentious issue between people. I think it would be great to show people that you can have different opinions or outlooks but still support and accept each other.

- In general - discussions about everything. Every day life. Things going on in the world that affect us. Just talking stuff through with other people can really shape the way you see things. Even discussions I've had on here have helped me look at things in a different way and consider alternatives to my own views.

When I got out of school, that directed learning stopped--and I realized that the way I learn requires somebody to be there explaining it, demonstrating it, writing things out and talking. I've had people direct me to online tutorials, but I don't seem to retain as much--and although I'm computer-savvy, code is like Greek to me. Think the furthest I got was with codecademy's Ruby course--but my brain says ""this is just fancy math, I can do this in my head faster than I can type it."" 

It's probably indicating that I need to change my approach, and I'm sure if I spent many hours and bashed my head against the keyboard a few times, I might get it.

One thing my friend and I considered was working on oDesk, or similar, but the postings seemed ""shady"" to me--broken English, unclear specifications. I'm quickly learning that you can find just about anything on Reddit and that it is quite helpful, so I'm definitely going to poke around. That in itself is a good use of time!

I am good with the software-troubleshooting side of computers and probably could make good money helping the technologically illiterate... things like setting up Windows, troubleshooting software, installing difficult programs or working around issues. My friends call me ""Internet Helpdesk,"" and one pays me with Steam games.

I also can write well (I did article copywriting for my friend's business, but I prefer the creative side), and I can proof anything. If my physical stats are minimized, well, writing's what I maxed out. 

Generally, I have a very fast turnover time and have the advantage of being available at any time of day. The only thing that concerns me with respect to work are taxes and the logistics of getting paid, but I want to sort this out when I call the office on Monday.

Regarding chairs, I was one of those kids who had doctors and PTs grossly advise against a powerchair for the sake of my arms, which were very strong before I got out of school. I can't lift more than 5lb, but I can pull large weights. These days my manual chair is a glorified computer chair, and I'd like to be able to exercise with it again, hence wanting a ramp. 

If I do get a physical job, I would like to get a powerchair, just to travel long distances. I've only had 3 or so chairs, and the most recent one, about 6-7 years old, came after a lot of hubbabaloo with AAAMedical--they tried to get me to switch chair brands and features and basically gave my family the runaround.

People say I am mostly intelligible, but that I tend to ""mumble"", which sounds like a normal volume to my sensitive ears. I think I sound like a simultaneously drunk and stoned 12-year old if I hear myself over a mic, which has left me self-conscious. That alone affects my speech, which regrettably isn't as verbose as this--my spoken register doesn't feel """"natural"" to me, I guess?

I have a fear of telephones and calling businesses due to not having regularly used one growing up--we had a 10 minute rule when I was a kid that made me just not bother. I've only recently started to make my own calls for things such as appointments, and hearing the SS offices ask for me makes me nervous (but I plan to work on it.)

I do host VOIP/Skype calls regularly and have a Google Voice number--if I'm comfortable I can VOIP for hours, since it doesn't tire my arm like holding a phone does. It could be possible to work through VOIP as well, but my house is small and has a lot of background noise from my parents and their dogs...

You don't really need a lawyer until (if) you need to appeal.  The application is all data collection and I don't believe there's anything a lawyer can do until the SSA makes their decision.

I know you've done it before, but make sure all your ducks are in order before you start the application.  All your doctor info, every date for every diagnosis, surgery, and hospital stay.   You probably already know this but it takes hours - it took me nearly 5 - to fill out the application online and it has a timeout if you stop working on it for a fairly short period of time.

Also, it's not much, but you might want to look at what your state has to offer for disability. The payments tend to be very small, and in some states if you get accepted into SSI or SSDI you then have to pay back the state (it comes out of your initial payment), but it's something.  You may also qualify for your state's version of Medicaid.

(It also offers services at the same hospital/healthcare unit I get my dental work done at, which is convenient.)

I went and spoke with my dad about this a few minutes ago, and, aside from him being more open about the idea of therapy than I'd thought, the conversation went as expected. To start off with, I brought up the idea of upgrading my computer, which gives some context as to how our conversations usually go:

(My parents pay me $50-100$ a month depending on expenses as a goodwill gesture, which I save up and sometimes use for the odd game here and there. I've got about $400, and I have a friend in California who provides me with hardware I'd otherwise be unable to get or afford. He offered to build me a new computer if I'd help by covering some of the part costs, but I'd need to find a way to get the cash to him, so I was going to ask my dad about sending a money order.)

When I told him I was thinking about upgrading my hardware, he asked why. I tried to explain to him the reasons that gamers opt for new hardware. He then said, predictably, to just wait until my stepmother's mom passes, we sell the house, and I get a new system then, when we move. Everything always goes back to this, complete with the same old spiel about how this is our last year here and we don't have long to go. This answer is so useless it's almost funny, which made him ask why I was laughing. I used that to segue into needing therapy, explaining that this, again, is really wearing on me.

To put my dad's line of thought another way, he's never stopped or forbidden me expressly from doing anything. In that way, it seems like his heart is in the right place, but my attempts to be proactive always get disparaged rather than encouraged. It's like he feels there is no point to trying to improve my life NOW, rather than later, and the paradisical descriptions of what my life will be like when we move back to WA are a cure-all bandaid. 

He says that he can't do anything physically to really help me until my stepmother's parents are gone and we have money. My parents have no real issue, it seems, with taking me to appointments or picking up items for me (although I'd rather shop for myself, because they tend to get the wrong things.) 

He ended this conversation with the usual warning about how we don't have much savings left from a car repair earlier in the year, and we may need that money in case something else breaks. It has the unintended effect of making me feel self conscious about the money I've ""saved"" for myself, and makes me feel like I can't use it.

I really, really, really hate being poor. I've read that there's a certain amount of money you can make as a disabled person before your benefits are cut (8k a year?) and even that would be way more than I'd need. I'm hoping that those services can educate me about the matter, and maybe, as you said, provide me with some form of job.

My dad also pointed out that they've offered to each me how to do things before, but I've never asked, and I myself can't remember such an offer. It's very hard for me to engage either of them in conversation because I don't feel I can articulate as well as I can through text, and years of habit has reduced my conversations with them to scripts with loads of stuttering and none of the advanced vocabulary I pride myself on. And teaching me would be difficult--the kitchen counters are way too high and there's not enough room for my chair to turn around. I'd probably improve a lot if I could get life skills training, which I'm hoping those services can provide. I'm going to call them on Monday--at the very least it'd get me out of the house.

This is a much, much longer reply than I'd anticipated, but as one last addendum I've kind of been afraid of group homes. I worry they'll force me into a schedule or infringe upon my privacy. The only advantage of living with my parents is that they generally keep to themselves, watching TV or sleeping and thus leaving me to my own devices. When I'm not depressed and actually enjoying the computer, I'm fine spending my time in front of it--and maybe, like a lot of things, I'm misinformed about what it's actually like to live in a good one. I wouldn't mind having someone to do housekeeping and such, as long as I was sure I could trust them and kept a sense of dignity.

Here's something from the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's FAQ on the Americans with Disability Act:  
 ""Q. Should I tell my employer that I have a disability?  
A. If you think you will need a reasonable accommodation in order to participate in the application process or to perform essential job functions, you should inform the employer that an accommodation will be needed. Employers are required to provide reasonable accommodation only for the physical or mental limitations of a qualified individual with a disability of which they are aware. Generally, it is the responsibility of the employee to inform the employer that an accommodation is needed.""

So I think as long as you feel like there will be accommodation required, you should disclose pretty early. I don't want to make any assumptions, but I would think that it may be important to explain why you may need to hear directions a few times, depending on what the training process is like where you're trying to work.  
It sounds like you have a good idea of how to get people to repeat/rephrase things, and if you are up front about needing an employer/trainer to do that, most reasonable people wouldn't find that a problem. Honestly, in a new job, it wouldn't hurt to hear things several times.  
You may want to consider asking them to print out some training material for you, if they don't usually. As accommodations go, that one is just so simple and easy! I'd suggest that for any employer anyway.  
I don't know if any of that helps. Some of your choices may depend on the specific job you're interviewing and applying for-- it may help to tailor your approach based on that. If you have any specific questions about your rights, laws, etc. I'm happy to help you dig through them!",1,0,1,0,0,

About being paired with a certain doctor.
it's because at the first stages of injury I was extremely emotion not to mention horribly negative. Also I wasn't very open to the idea of surgery. mostly because, not all surgeons here can be trusted. So I was afraid he'd do more damage than harm. Example. Instead of sewing a meniscus tears some doctors here will take out the entire thing. When you're under anesthesia you don't have a say on what will or will not happen. They'll also take half of it off when they could have just sown it. That made me afraid of pursing an operation that I possibly needed. However now that I am open to the idea (because I really do want to get better) the doctor is resisting me when I ask if I need an operation or arthroscopic examination. And keeps brushing me off. Normally because my family is also treating this like my imagination (as they are not me and don't have to live day to day with this) they also make me feel like I shouldn't see a doc. But the first thing I feel when I can't even walk normal distances normally (like using the right leg as my crutch) is something must be done.

I am sorry for my negative terminology and my use of the word normal I am not saying that people with disabilities aren't normal but what I mean here is I can't be who I was before that's what I refer to as the norm. It's a personal thing directed and geared to me mostly. So if I hurt anyone with my terminology I deeply apologize. Thank you for giving me hope still.

Honestly, I don't think there was any thought in making her ""less attractive"" She was a very real character, Some people are arm amputees, Some people are asexual, Some people like dressing masculine, Some people like shaving their heads. It's totally fair that these traits could all exist within the same person, It's not about making her less attractive *and* disabled. It's about making a character who is *real*.

Though I do agree they tried to use the character to tick too many diversity boxes at once, as one of the first forms of media to feature asexuality and positive disability it was a lot for the general public to swallow and may have gone down easier if it was two seperate characters, who knows.

I'm kind of into masculine women, so I found her incredibly attractive.

3d8520ea-41aa-4206-9242-a26c8870e4f7,1431784848,"Some therapists will kick you off after you get better to a point. Insist that you are not better, keep copies of all medical records and ask them for copies of their reports. Go through their notes and gather whatever info you can, educate yourself. I would look for other doctors and PTs if no one will listen. If a PT is not meeting your needs, perhaps ask to speak with the office or clinic manager, state that your current PT is ""not a good fit"" and perhaps they could recommend someone more enthusiastic? 

I am going to guess here but your knee swelling may be due to fluid going to your knee. My PT explained that when the knee is hurt the body's natural reaction is to surround it with fluid to protect it. It takes WEEKS, even months for fluid to go away. It can cause a tight feeling and may even cause your knee to look bigger. Any PT who is worth anything will measure your knee's ability to bend and also how far flat you can lay your leg. For example with my broken ligament I could not lay my leg down flat. My PT also measured around my leg and knee so we had a measurable way to see if the swelling went down, which it did. Icing and elevating can also help reduce the fluid but you would have to ask the PT how many times to ice per day and how long. 

I wish you good luck, knee injuries are a pain in the ass and a really slow process. But, if you buckle down with more work and research, you will most certainly get to a better place mentally, if not physically as well.

I tried to run right after my leg got better and to my dismay fell reinjured it, re-lazered it, re-sonared it. And it's actually worse off than when it was healing well. (Sonar and lazer are like a double edge sword for me, they worked for me at a point but they are actually the cause of my current pain now) ever since the last sessions something messed up inside, (I don't know what), and the areas which hurt right after those sessions are the same areas hurting today.

Also my leg actually got swollen after one of the sessions (area over the knee), and ever since they've been burning. Doc says the muscles around my knee are really weak (especially the part above the knee. It's actually burning for some reason, that burning sensation was there for six months, and it swells at random along with the rest of the knee.). He also says my side muscles are weak (at the injury site) 

I am not sure what kind of surgery I need but all I want is to know what exactly I am dealing with. Like I am okay with an examination surgery if that's what it takes. (If it's worth it I'll do it). 

I healed my knee partially via physiotherapy but the physiotherapists keep telling me they have more important patients to heal so they have 'no time for me'

It could be many things. I did have a terrible attitude in the earlier stages but that's because I was dealing with a lot. I am not saying that justifies my behavior. So now I am torn (I did need help for a long time. For a year I've been hurting. Still my therapy was cut short due to the 'we don't have time for you thing') The confusion comes from the fact that I did need an operation at some point, to the 'we don't have time for you' to 'it's all your imagination' to the contradiction of still dealing with pain and weird clicky noises when I walk, or sleep. (And also the fact that my weight is shifted to my right leg and that it actually hurts to walk which is the most basic thing one can do).

I'll take all the advice that you listed before, don't think that I didn't read everything you said. It was super helpful. And I'll try to find solutions using your advice.

The barrier was that physical aids (hearing aids, FM recievers, and so on) don't help, so I have problems understanding professors. Thankfully, the Disability Services office at my university is wonderful. Before seeking help, I knew something was wrong, but it didn't show up on hearing tests since it's not an issue of volume or pitch. What happened is that I got an adviser who helped me explain how I perceive sound, and what makes it different. Before, CAPD was an umbrella term for ""something's wrong with my hearing but I don't know what it is."" However, after many appointments with the adviser, we picked through my experiences to come up with a nice, clear definition. After that, it was an issue of figuring out what specifically helped.

My barrier is that my hearing disorder has no cure or treatment, and there's a lot of stigma surrounding it. People don't realize I'm not just not caring / not paying attention / a selective listener / being dramatic, and it's heartbreaking when you don't know what's wrong yet still can't meet expectations. The only real solution is disclosure... it sucks, but it's all I have. What I do is tell my professor that I'm hard of hearing, ask them where they normally stand when speaking, ask where they go if they like to move around, and ask where the speakers are if a microphone is used. Then, I sit close to the sound source and hope for the best. My professors are very supportive and some even wore a microphone so I could test hardware... but in the end, it's all hit and miss. I have a favorite spot for each teacher, based on where they stand and how much they move... if the prof has a tough speech pattern, I keep a ""translation key"" on hand for when I figure out a word. It's unfortunate that I don't have a better solution, but at least the university did everything they could.",1,0,1,0,0,

I'd also point out that [self-employment income](https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0300301210), as long as it was reported to the IRS, can qualify someone for SSDI benefits. SSDI is basically a modified insurance program. It is especially likely if your father's total income per year was greater than the appropriate figures in [this chart](https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0300301250).

If your father decides to pursue SSDI or SSI, keep in mind attorneys there usually work on a contingency. They do not charge any up front fees and only take a set amount (capped at the lesser of 25% or $6,000.00) of any backpay award if the person successfully receives benefits.

589f63c3-bad5-4542-ac39-e0e5a5dc6591,1431387766,"If you've been on SSA-administered payments since childhood, that's SSI.  SSDI is something you have to pay into. It's possible that your father is collecting SSDI if he worked for some years.  Because SSI doesn't come from working, the payments are smaller than the SSDI payments.  The basic SSI payments are (IIRC) generated on things like your living conditions (eg. who do you live with?  But I'm pretty sure a carer does not count!), your assets, and if you are working. 

Ticket to Work is nothing to be afraid of.  You report wages by calling them on the phone and telling them how much you make. After  you make a certain amount, they reduce your SSI payment by $1 for every $2 you make.  *The idea is to keep you solvent*, not to punish you for working. They *want* to help you start working and keep you working, if that's possible for you.  They're there to help.

As to home visits, again, not something to be afraid of. They're not there to rush you off to some group home. They're more likely there to see what kind of accommodations you need and to help you get them.  

And as for getting a job in another state -- why wouldn't they help?  SSA is run by the federal government, not the states. You might have to (re)apply in the new states for things like Medicaid and SNAP (which are state-run), if you qualify for those, but the SSA only wants to know where you live. There's no restriction on moving from state to state.

My family didn't do anything like that but for a while I lived in a country and society where disabled people were, and still are, hidden. I had very poor body image in my teens, and that, combined with a traumatic event that led to PTSD (which I didn't know at the time), led me very close to a full-blown eating disorder. 

That led to a whole host of health problems and I look back at my teen self and I feel angry that I allowed myself to internalize that negativity from society because ultimately it has only hurt me and let's be honest, nobody with a disability needs more problems. I certainly didn't and I regret the good years I wasted on the self-hate, low self-esteem, anxiety and depression over my body, fits of rage when I didn't look how I imagined myself to be and the energy I expended on that instead of all the other things I could have been doing.

I would strongly, strongly recommend seeing a therapist if that is a financial possibility for you. It really helped me realize quite a few things. I don't know if that is a possibility for you so I just want to say that I recommend you spend some time thinking about your body. Sometimes, self-consciousness can spill over into self-disgust and that's really what you want to try to tackle because if you can get over that then you can stop viewing yourself from the outside and just be at ease with yourself. Be honest about what it is that bothers you. For me, I just felt that my body from the neck to the waist was disfigured and broken. And you know what? It is. I have scoliosis. I have a huge scar from my neck to my waist. Above and below my chest are not proportional to each other. But you know what else? This body has survived a lot, it has been good to me. The scar means something to me. As weak and broken as my body is, it is also incredibly strong and resilient in its own way. It has got me this far and deserves to be treated with kindness and love, not criticism and disgust. I used to cringe because this just seems so cliche but fuck that, it's true. 

It takes time to be able to feel like that but it can be achieved if you work on it. Of course I don't feel like I'm going to be the next runway model for Marc Jacobs or whatever, but I feel much less at pains with it. There are enough hurdles in our daily life, this is something we get to choose not to deal with. It's not as easy as that obviously and I don't want to trivialize how psychologically difficult it can be not to feel the way you do, but ultimately you have all the power over how you feel about your body, nobody else. There are probably things in your daily life and health you don't have power over but this isn't one of them. Keep reminding yourself of that. Hope this helps you at least know that you're not alone in the way you feel.

She has said her wording of her post could be shared, but I am not giving her name even though the news named the child just because I wouldn't want mine put out on Reddit and have people nosing into the rest of my life. I think she is handling this with a lot of class.  Here is her post:

""~Just thought that Guymon would like to know how some of the faculty members (Mr. Williams) treat their students. Last Friday my son was supposed to walk across that stage to receive his diploma but it never happened. Instead 20 minutes before the ceremony, a teacher comes up to my mother to inform her that Mr. Williams was not letting A.J walk across the stage because his shoes are not in dress code. My mother went to Mr. Williams to discuss this, he became aggressive with her and he screamed into her face until he finally said that if he saw A.J there that night; Mr. Williams would have him arrested. Not one thing had taken place for him to make such a threat. Mr. Williams knows A.J s situation. He knows about the accident, he knows that he must wear special shoes due to the injuries that he sustained to his left foot due to an accident. He is aware of a lot of the surgeries that A.J had to his foot just to get it to where it is now. This child’s foot is over 1 shoe size smaller than the other, it has a plate holding the arch in place and not counting many other pins throughout it. His foot has a knot on the top side of his foot about the size of half an orange. He has a very hard time finding any shoes that fit comfortably. The shoe cannot put pressure on it in one way or another. He cannot wear boots, dress shoes or even most tennis shoes. As my mother was trying to explain the plethora of documentation that has been submitted to the school all the way up to now, that is when he got very hostile towards her. One of A.J s teachers who relocated a couple of years ago made a special trip to see him walk across that stage and instead had to try to comfort him on the day that should have been the biggest milestone that he had reached to this point. As I watched some of the students walk that path I saw numerous of them not in dress code one child had on a pair of brown cowboy boots on. Even if he did not have this disability, why would you make a big scene over a pair of shoes on such a big day, you did not do it to the other students so why single him out? Instead you took this very important day away from him, one that he will never be able to get back. He went home crushed. We as his family and close friends had to try to pick up the pieces and let him know that WE ARE PROUD OF HIM AND EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED! We did turn this heartbreaking experience into something great by the end of the night, but I just really want to know why would you single him out once again and be a bully about it, I really thought that you were there to help our children. I have attached the photo of one of the students that was not in dress code to this. 
Sincerely,
A very disappointed mother.~""

She is very appreciative of people's response and truly wishes this can teach a lesson to other schools out there on civility and compassion.  I encourage you all to share this on your social media sites to send a shot of knowledge to other administrators that IDEA and ADA do not just apply to the class room but to all activities non-disable children are able to enjoy.   

I fought my battles with my son's educational process and worked 20 years in child avocation. This stuck me to the core because I know a lot of this town reflects the action of the school and it is just one of thousands small school systems across the US that find special needs or disabilities as a ""bother"" or ""taking away from 'normal' students."" So much progress has been made in may areas since we began our journey in 1990. This just hurt my heart to see it still happen 25 years later :(

Thanks again and know it was appreciated.

I cannot actually imagine being able-bodied and then having to adapt to a whole new way of life as I've always been disabled. However, it's a constant learning process for all of us! 

Maybe talk to him and ask him what's going through his mind. Maybe he has worries that he's not voicing like ""How would I get to that bar?"" or ""What if we end up going to a place that isn't accessible and then everybody realizes that they can't go inside because of me?"". If you really want to help, I suggest going to some effort to think about how you will answer these when and if he asks. For example, maybe you need to scout out your area and see which old and new hangout places are accessible, think about the transportation involved to get there etc. Then you can present him with a list and say 'look dude, X, Y and Z are accessible, let's go there on the weekend, I've planned it all, we're going to take this bus which is accessible etc...'.

If that doesn't work, you can organize a get together at his house perhaps. Invite some of your group over, do whatever it is you guys like to do. Hang out, chat, eat some junk, whatever. Show him that socially, nothing has really changed. That might make him more open to the idea of going out when you bring it up again.

If all that fails, you might need to go nuclear. I'm afraid that disabled people sometimes just need to hear some tough love. How you phrase that and how firm you are about it is up to you and how well you know your friend as well as how long it has been since the accident. Sometimes it can be too soon for that. That's something you could maybe consider down the line. 

Until then, all you can do is be patient and show him that he's not alone by helping him find ways to adapt to his new life. Disability can be very isolating at times and sometimes those who aren't disabled might not be able to understand why. You seem like one of those who genuinely wants to help and understand even if you don't have all the answers right now, like it or not people like you can make all the difference!

Since it's all contracted out, a single driver being a jerk could make the whole company liable for a *looooot* of money. To prevent that they'd have to add lots of barriers to who could be a driver -- screening, training, etc. The app guys want no part in any of that, they just want to connect drivers to riders and make money (and that's really not an unreasonable goal for a company to have).

From the comments here and elsewhere though I'm gathering that they've pushed back on special categories or whatever that would allow drivers and riders to solve the problem on their own.... THAT seems like something Uber the app should have to fix. Jerk drivers also need to be fixed (though I assume that already happens naturally -- the driver from this article would have to be *racking up* nasty reviews and will -- if the system works as advertised -- be barred from the service in the near future). 

Anyway Uber wants to be exempt because they want the drivers to assume all the liability, responsibility, and whatever else. I don't think that's necessarily a problem -- the problem would be that drivers aren't doing it, and/or the app/service isn't facilitating it well enough. The drivers are where this gets solved.... and Uber is how we talk to the drivers..... and ultimately I guess money is how we talk to Uber.",2,0,2,0,0,

&gt;Hello School Board Members, Mr. Principal, and Asst. Principals:

&gt;I learned about your high school's graduation ceremony today by reading News Channel 10's article. While the discrimination the news article highlighted was bad enough, the news article apparently did not even realize that at least one other student was allowed to walk despite wearing sneakers. As such, the facade that this was a dress code violation is that much more unbelievable. 

&gt;I am just writing to let you know that people as far away as Florida are disturbed by the show of discrimination against this young man. Such discrimination is not only against the law, but also against common decency. Disability groups, parents, and those who just believe in treating each other with respect are all very distraught. 

&gt;Even though Guymon is a relatively small city, actions like these cannot be hidden from broader public view in this ""day and age."" The media, this time, did its job by bringing attention to this incident. Please realize, from all of the recent attention given to police brutality, that illegal and immoral discrimination cannot be hidden as easily as it once was. If your decision-makers do not have common decency or care about legal repercussions, perhaps they will at least care about nationwide embarrassment. 

&gt;Very truly,

Lupus is an autoimmune disorder which basically means my immune system is confused as hell and attacks my joints and skin the way it should be attacking viruses. Symptom onset around age 15, but wasn't connected to Lupus until this last year when I was 29, by a rheumatologist. Joint pain, rashes, photosensitivity (basically allergic reaction to sunlight), mouth sores, inflammation, temperature sensitivity. Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder that causes uncontrollable spasms, contractions, and postures. Acute episodes are called storms and look a lot like seizures. Onset of symptoms October 2013, beginning with mild tremors and difficulty walking, with my first acute episode November 2014. Neurologist decided it was Dystonia, not a seizure disorder, Jan 2015.

Who said since my leg didn't swell then I am probably 'fine' but it turns out that cartilage injuries don't cause swelling like say a ligament and say a side ligament with lots of blood flow so that's why it didn't swell at the time.

9e0a92a9-59e9-4f94-98ae-2e8a3accd178,1431777357,"My suggestion would be to try to find a different doctor to see. I'm not sure how things work in the US (I am presuming you're in the US, of course), but it took me years to find a doctor who'd refer me on to a specialist. ""Thankfully"", my mom also has the same condition as me, so it was relatively straightforward to get a diagnosis once I was seeing the right person.

My condition also doesn't show up on any tests. It's called fibromyalgia, and you basically have to test for everything else, and if it's not those things, it's FM. I don't think you have fibromyalgia from what you've said, but do take heart in that sometimes you just need to exhaust every other option before you get to the real issue.

I would strongly advise getting a walking stick or a crutch. Firstly, it will help you to take some weight off your leg if you need it, but also it'll make your condition more obvious and, to some people more legitimate. It might be hard to pluck up the courage to go buy one, or to even go out of the house with one, but part of the reason I use a crutch is so that people know there's something wrong with me, and that I am ""legitimately"" asking for a seat if I need one on the bus or train. Invisible disabilities are really difficult to deal with, so that's why I choose to make mine visible with the crutch. In some ways, it's me taking ownership of my condition, recognising that it can affect me quite badly, but that I am still going to get out and do stuff.

If you don't feel able to get a proper stick or crutch, you could get a foldable/collapseable stick, [like this](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Adjustable-Aluminium-Folding-Walking-81-92cm/dp/B001EGLIFA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431776774&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=foldable+stick). It means you can keep it in your bag, and can pop it out really easily for when you need it.

Once you get a diagnosis, things will improve, both medically and mentally. Once you know what's wrong, you'll be able to make a plan to deal with it, either via rehabilitation or pain management. As someone else suggested, seeing a physiotherapist could really help, or potentially a pain management specialist (not sure what they're called in the US).

In regards to feeling lonely, I'd say that you've got every right to feel crap about it as you've been dealt a pretty rubbish set of cards... but things will improve. My previous partner felt that he couldn't deal with my disability, and was overwhelmed and confused by it, as I had started out perfectly physically able, but had gotten much worse since we were together. However, my current partner is absolutely wonderful - he helps and understands me and loves me despite my disability. You'll find someone for you, and as long as you're upfront about your condition, it won't come as a surprise to someone. If someone rejects you just because you can't walk very well, then they clearly aren't a kind and loving person, and you should move on.",3,0,3,0,0,

I know depression can be crippling but it's usually treatable and people with it can lead productive lives.  If things go well you may then be able to start taking some college level classes.

""I am a dependent person. I eat food whose final preparation I handle myself, but which has come to me across roads laid and maintained by other people from stores staffed by other people -- and even those people didn't grow or raise or harvest or slaughter any of it.

""None of us, of course, is independent in either sense. We grow up in social contexts, supported and denied, enabled and disabled by those around us.

I do not believe that anyone is going to ""put you in a home"" as long as you are cognizant of your own issues.  There are plenty of people with CP who live on their own. 

As you're over 18 your SSI payments should be going directly to YOU.  Contact the SSA to fix this. 

There's a lot out there to help you, even in rural nowheresville :-).  Disability-supportive housing exists (though it often has a year+ waiting list).  There are programs that help low-income people on SSI with food, utilities, housing, medical care, and more.  

The SSA also has programs to help people get a job, from training to helping you with a job search.  This includes paying for accommodations like getting a powered wheelchair and even help getting a wheelchair-accessible vehicle.  

To echo what someone else said, finding a social worker is a good first step.  Don't listen to anyone who tells you ""You can't do that.""  You can; you just need to find the right folks to help you.

SSI is for people who have no or low income who have not paid enough in to the Social Security system, whether because they have not worked enough hours or because they were self-employed and did not pay into the system.   SSI is funded solely by federal government funding.

SSDI is for people who have paid into the system by at least some minimum amount. The amount you get monthly depends on how much you've paid in, with an upper limit.  Because it's funded by money you've paid into it, the amount you get is typically more than SSI.

I actually used to wind surf before that and even successfully did some windsurfing recently .m. (oddly the wind carries the kite part for you so all you have to do is have upper body strength more, because the wind is doing the carrying for you) (my situation actually probably gets worse at random because I keep carrying my laptop around since I am a programmer. it's that extra weight that screws my knee over, and the heavier books I carry). So I did some windsurfing (but my knee was feeling better for it gets better and not better at random, not sure why) and it was just fine. However it was -sand boarding- that killed my knee. not recommended. borderline suicidal. If you want to do sandboarding you'd better be a parkour expert.

It was my first time, there was a bad instructor. That's all it took to get that injury. And since I was the unluckiest in the entire group they blamed it solely on me.

I got a job in undergrad as a research assistant working for a professor I had taken classes with before. Importantly I figured there wouldn't be any issues with him because he knew me in person, and for the most part I physically ""pass"" The jo description was basically ""you are a research assistant, you and a bunch of other newbie research assistant undergrads who know nothing will be trained up on how to use equipment and whatever you have a knack for will become your project""

Importantly everyone who worked that summer knew nothing about research, and nothing was really expected of them initially.

Essentially the first few weeks were essentially training rotations where they would take us around to work on x, or shadow someone working on x so we could understand how to do x. Well everyone but me. From the start, with noo exceptional programming experience (at least no more than the rest of the incoming cohort) I was put on all the programming jobs, essentially skipping out on most of the training rotations. When I was included in those training rotations I was basically stuck in a corner to watch while everyone else got the hands on experience. In essence my boss thought I couldn't do shit, and instead of putting me in the ""awkward"" situation of maybe asking me to do something I couldn't do he chose to play incredibly safe and assume the only things I could do involved sitting. This left me with far fewer skills than my cohort after a few weeks, and my coworkers were (understandably) pissed because they were doing work I should be doing (except I was never trained so I actually couldn't do the work efficiently now).

In the end I got so demoralized by the entire ordeal that by the latter half of the summer I ended up half assing my work, which seemed pointless compared to the work my cohort was doing, and all because of my boss playing it uber safe.

In the end I wish I had had the balls to go and confront my boss about this, but I never wanted to stir shit up/ I;m sure he would have just acted defensive about it.

I've got a friend who had a similar experience - he had an accident while go-karting, and everyone kept dismissing his pain and telling him it was fine. I'd suggest just keep trying to get a diagnosis from a doctor who's supportative.

1. Some people will never look past a disability. Some people will never be willing to date someone with a disability. And some people will judge and reject you because of a disability. This, I believe, is actually an advantage of disability. It acts as a built in shitty-human detector. Automatically people are weeded out for you and eventually you'll look around and realize that the people who are in your life are vastly more awesome than everyone else because they won't give a damn about the disability. It doesn't mean that it doesn't hurt at first. It's a huge thing to come to terms with - that people will judge and reject you for something you can't control and even when you come to terms with it, it'll still surprise you and hurt you from time to time. But, like I said, I think it's a blessing to have something that saves me the time and effort of dealing with shitty people.

2. I have a very serious disability and use a power wheelchair. I've been married for 8 years. Marriage is not out of the cards for you. 

3. You don't have to become ""good enough"". You have to try your best to be a good person and try your best to make peace with your life and any limitations in it. A therapist might be useful for you because you're engaging in really damning thought patterns that I recognize from my own attempts to make peace with my disability. ",3,0,3,0,0,

It's as simple as repetition and standing nearby, but I'm not sure if it's worth bringing up the word ""disability"". I don't want to scare off an employer, but I don't want to get stuck in a rut from not telling.

My mom understands hearing loss, so she's helping me out. She's been taking me to each place of employment so I can walk around (retail settings) and check out the volume. None seem *too* bad, and I've been fine working in a small office before. (That position was reserved for graduating high school students... I have excellent references but it was a one-time offer.)  Basically, I'm torn between telling my employer right away, and waiting it out. If I tell them outright, I risk the stigma of being ""disabled"", although it's ""not that bad"". However, if I don't tell and wait too long, then I needed to disclose sooner. I'm nervous because this will be my first time disclosing.

I couldn't find any information for Ontario, but I believe the laws regarding employment disability are set on a federal level here... anyways, I found something from the Alberta government. Basically, [I can choose to not disclose.](https://alis.alberta.ca/ep/eps/tips/tips.html?EK=163) However, I'll obviously need to disclose if this becomes a problem, or the employer won't even know I need accommodation.

However, I do think that she seems a bit narcissistic and controlling over your money. My best advice to you (again assuming she is not your payee) is to have your direct deposit switched to an account with just your name on it. If you want to do that then you need to be prepared to talk with your mom to come up with some sort of rent payment and perhaps buying your own food, paying for your phone, etc. That way you are still contributing to the household (which at 19 you should be) and will have some control over the rest of your money.

While you do that I say start looking into subsidized housing in your area. They will only charge you 30% of your income.

To ramble a little in response...

I think that there is such a shame (for me at least) with being dependent on family, friends and the government. There is also great fear, because with benevolence comes the ability for someone to withdraw their help. 

When caregivers start to feel like they're working for me as a favor rather than as a job, then they often perceive my dependence more acutely and my ability to direct and to choose my life is taken away. But with the county paying below a living wage in my area, don't they have to have a certain amount of benevolence to work?

When my life is running well, I feel free and able to do what I want. My assistants are my arms and legs. My chair is my motion. The elevator is my stairs and the cars are my subway. 

But because there are so many more individualized supports in my life than there were before I got sick, there are more chances for them to go wrong. Some are as simple as an elevator, and some are more complex, like an intimate understanding of my day to day needs. 

Because of my illness, I lack flexibility to absorb failures. My body rejects me. It craves activities and then punishes me when I try them. My brain tries to reach for knowledge but is inconsistent in both memory and rationale. Each failure, internal or external, affects my health directly.

Only tiny things went wrong today, and I laugh, but am back in bed and feel my dependence acutely. ",2,0,2,0,0,

This is why when I fly I take the approach that I am going to make myself as dependent on the airline as I can. This does two things. First, if they are made aware from the beginning that I will need help for just about everything, then I am more likely to get it. Tell the check-in agent. Tell the gate agent. When you pre-board, tell the flight attendants. Something like ""I promise I am not going to be very high maintenance for you but I will need help boarding, getting to my seat, and dealing with bags in the overhead compartment."" Second, if I have this rule in place for myself I am going to ask for help even where I might not have needed it in the real world. If you do this and combine it with a smile and a thankful attitude, you really are going to be more likely to be helped. The backup plan here IS your actual ability. If you ask a flight attendant for help with your bag and are flat out denied then you can go ahead and try yourself. Waiting for them to offer is really an ineffective way to get anything done on a plane. (Even though MOST of the flight attendants I have flown with have offered and have been great...but I think this was because I initially did let them know I would need it.)

I am reminded of that incident where the guy felt he had to crawl on or off the plane. Had he just stayed put and said, ""No I can't crawl!"" (even if he could have) they would have figured something else out and he would have neither been embarrassed or injured. 

This also goes for passing through security. There used to be a time when yes, I could have stood up from the wheelchair but it was difficult and annoying. When they would ask if I could stand, I'd just say ""No"" and that was it. Sure the pat-down was a little more time but it was also more comfortable and safer than me falling down.",3,0,3,0,0,

There are options for you to find help.  One is to call 211, which is run by the United Way. They have people who should be able to help you find some care.  Another is to contact your county social services system and see if you can get assigned a social worker to help you.  If your panic attacks become severe, you might look into visiting a psychiatric emergency room.  Just like a physical-problem ER, nobody is there to make you a resident - just get you help.

The thread is fine...but some of your wording is not.  You were ""normal"" before.  You are still normal now.  People with disabilities...**are normal.**  

It might be good for you to do some reading on disability, and living with injuries like this.  You can still get married!  You can still live your life!  It just might be a little different than you expected.  

I can barely do many of the things I used to love doing - but I'm still happy, I'm in a great relationship, I'm enjoying life.  It's not what I expected, but it's still good.  I can't exercise, ride unicycles, go hiking, work...but I can still do a lot of my favorite things.

Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is not dependent on employment history. An individual can obtain SSI benefits even if they have never worked, as long as he or she fits the disability criteria.

Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is the component of the Social Security program that is dependent on work history. 

Did your father work at all over the past decade? If so, there could be a slim chance he meets insurance coverage requirements for SSDI.

&gt; My mother works part-time (22 hours a week) and earns unemployment income, in case that has any impact on this.

This may affect or prevent your father from receiving SSI cash benefits. While there is no work history requirement, there is a [resource cap on households]( http://www.ssa.gov/ssi/text-resources-ussi.htm).

Your father may be eligible for Medicaid. The Wisconsin Medicaid website can be found [here]( https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/medicaid/index.htm). You may want to look into [other social services]( https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov) offered in Wisconsin. There are also legal service organizations that work with people 60 plus (your dad may be close enough in age it doesn't matter), such as [CWAG]( http://cwagwisconsin.org/elder-law-center/).

Best of luck to you and your family.",2,0,2,0,0,

I do apologize if some questions seem really basic, want to make sure your bases are covered. 

- what type of doctor are you seeing? Or what types of doctors have you seen? Specialists I would recommend are an orthopedic surgeon or sports medicine doctor. 

- a lot of people don't understand how the knee is. You can't ""walk off"" a knee injury. It takes time. It takes a LOT of work. Did you ever have physical therapy? I had several months and did my exercises daily and it made a massive improvement. Although I do not know what parts of your knee are damaged, any PT may help at least reduce pain. I also did lots of ice therapy but under a PT's supervision. You can hurt yourself icing too much too. 

- DO NOT attempt other sports/impact exercises unless approved by your doctor. Knees take forever to do any healing and high impact activities such as running will exacerbate it. Now that I'm doing better, I prefer ""low impact"" activities such as swimming and cycling. These also help build the muscles *around* my knee which in turn supports my lack of a ligament. 

- you may need knee replacement surgery. Are you open to this? I know several people that have had them and are extremely happy with the results and even went back to some of their old activities. 

- with the knee being part of the skeletal system, you have to realize your knee could be affecting other parts of your body - alignment of your hip and spine, positioning of your feet....meanwhile if any of that is out of alignment it is constantly pulling your muscles out of position. After two years your muscles may have got used to being in an unnatural or distorted position. This all needs to get checked out. I personally choose to see a chiropractor, not everyone agrees with chiropractic but I have found an excellent one and bounced back 95% from a neck injury and chronic jaw pain. I might not recommend a chiro now but maybe down the road. 

- along with everyone else, I would recommend you see a counselor because you very well could have depression at this point. There is such a thing as short term or ""situational"" depression which you can definitely have hope about bouncing back from! ",3,0,3,0,0,

Though I'm not going to dismiss it solely as that obviously.  My family are good people.  I don't always agree with them, but I know they care.  And I know how this sub hates being an ""inspiration"", but I do know that a lot of my family sees me as one.  I don't like being called an inspiration, and I don't see myself as one, but I get it, and I know they mean it in good faith.  

And trust me, any funds raised will either be going towards the original intent, or towards a charity.  My aunt set it up so that if something falls through with the insurance and car, I can still do an option like buying portable hand controls (thanks to the suggestion of another redditor in this sub) or renting a car or something of that nature.  But also for if insurance falls through in a bit of a worse way.  The accident wasn't severe, but the lady hit me with enough force that it caused damage to the frame.  I am waiting for the insurance adjuster to find the time to take a look at the car.  If they decide to total it, that makes my situation a bit worse.  Based on the estimate of what I'd get if they total the car, it's not going to get me anything comparable.  I have a car with suicide doors in order to make throwing the chair in and out easy.  The car I own is the last year and model that the company made with suicide doors.  Finding a used one in the price range of what they will pay me for totaling the car will not cover it.  And what I do get will have about 50,000 miles more.  So to put it simple, if I want to get the same car, I will be paying more money for a car that has more miles.  All because some lady didn't stop at a red light.  That's the frustrating part.  And my car is on the low end of the spectrum.  If I can't find a replacement of the same model, I'm going to have to look at fancier cars with suicide doors and that means I'm looking at paying almost double.  I don't need something fancy, but if I can't find something at the low-end of the spectrum, my only option is to move up.  So if they total the car and I have to buy a new one, the funds from this project will go towards helping pay the difference.

You can even prepare something ahead of time and read it, if that helps. 2) As in the earlier example sentence always make the subject of your sentence ""I,"" never say ""you don't listen"" or ""you should..."" always use ""I"" statements that can't be taken as combattive. For example, ""I would like...because..."" or ""I feel that I am not being respected"" etc. 3) Also, I think it would help your argument if you mentioned how times have changed, in the sense that technology, infrastructure, and social tolerance have improved, all allowing you to be more independent than when she grew up.

&gt; Nash, a West Virginia Native, shared a Nobel Prize for Economics in 1994, the year before he joined the Princeton mathematics department as a senior research mathematician.

&gt; The last time many at Princeton saw Nash was in late March, when the university held a celebration following the announcement that he had won the Abel Prize with Nirenberg.

&gt; &amp;quot;The Abel Prize is top-level among mathematics prizes,&amp;quot; Nash said in his soft voice at the event, according to an account written by the university&amp;#039;s press office.

What matters is that if it hurts to move, it's not alright, and there **MIGHT** be structural problems -- again, though, a lot of that **can** be solved with physical therapy and strengthening muscles around the knee.

Focus on what matters for right now. Make sure you communicate with your attorney to ensure that he/she has all of your medical and mental health records. Stay current with your treatment. If any new developments occur, let your attorney know immediately.

When you get to your hearing, you're going to need to explain to the judge why you are disabled. Now is a good time to start thinking about that. You can tell the judge you have all these medical or mental health diagnoses, but why are they disabling? What about them prevents you from working?

Remember that disability, at least for Social Security, basically means you cannot perform any full-time work. This includes jobs like a surveillance systems monitor, e.g., someone who sits at a desk and watches security camera footage for eight hours per shift. 

Start thinking about why your conditions prevent you from doing a job like that. Talk with your attorney about this before the hearing. This way he/she can give you advice on how to phrase different things and he/she can remind you of any of these issues if you forget during the hearing. 

Good luck at your hearing! ",3,0,3,0,0,

Don't get my wrong: I understand how you feel and you have every right to feel the way you do. if you listen to the video and listen to the way this actor describes his character, he sounds really proud and excited to be part of the film and it seems that the director/writer incorporated his condition into his character's story.

I really hate to go the ""It could be worse"" route, but that's all I've really got here. Did the character have agency? Was he well written?

Called the office twice. First time was lunch hour, so I presumed they were out. Tried again a few minutes ago. Both times, the phone rings dozens of times until I decide to cut it off.

This is making me question the legitimacy of the site (or at least the phone number of that specific location. The particular building I am trying to contact is in one town, but their phone number has the area code of another, likely where the main office is.)

I know that small towns tend not to update their websites, if they even have any--but I was able to find some employee names on another page, and they still are listed as working there. Dad says they will go into town and check out the physical location to see if there's any specific business hours... but there wasn't even an answering machine.

If this doesn't work, my only other option as far as vocational rehab is concerned is to go to the state-level DVR, but the nearest state office is in a city an hour away. I suspect that the application and other processes would involve having to physically go there, which isn't possible. State DVR seems geared more towards finding permanent employment that would pay more than I'm looking for. I don't know how much they'd be able to help with a telecommuting job.

In the meantime, I'm considering ""alternative"" methods of work like one user mentioned, such as starting a blog. I looked around on PrestoExperts and almost made an account, but then I realized they need everyone to fill out a W9.... Not only do I not understand taxes, but I'm also concerned about the effect on my benefits were I to file.

PS - About pain - I don't know if this could be a reason or if it could be a small part of the reason but I had a similar kind of experience. I had a surgery when I was young and for a few years afterwards I had these pains that were similar to the pain I experienced in post-operative care. I had completely healed but I would get these sharp pains. Eventually they went away and I now know they were a psychological response to a traumatic experience. Could it be that your accident was so nasty and took such a psychological toll on you that you're experiencing some kind of trauma that is manifesting itself as physical pain? I don't know the answer but it's another question you could ask the doctor you go to see. It could of course be something actually physically wrong with the knee, I'm just trying to think if there are any further questions you could ask the doctor so that you can try to get all your bases covered in order to think about what to do next.

EDIT: I just want to say that if that IS the case and it is psychological pain manifesting as physical, that does not make it less real, less difficult or less painful and you are still well within your right to seek help and support from health professionals. ",2,0,2,0,0,
