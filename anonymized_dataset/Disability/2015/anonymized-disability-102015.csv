Making sure doctors reported their findings, asking for corrections to omissions,  organizing the reports, scanning them, sending them to the attorney plus tracking down doctors who would see me AND insisting on doctors not nurse practitioners and interns. 

One doctor in UC Davis reported on the signs of paralysis on my left side and nerve impingment in my back and other issues, but when I asked for the report it was all blank. They somehow lost ALL my case papers and didn't even have a record of me even being there.

The attorney told me I did an excellent job in getting the documentation and organizing it so well despite the fact that I can no longer remember to take my pills and have to chant what I'm about to do aloud to force me to remember what I'm doing.

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1444340803,"First, there is no need for an attorney. SSDI/SSI attorney's get paid based on back pay so if you are already on benefits there is really no money in it for them. 

SSA has your entire original file (at least they should, you were allowed right at the beginning of when they transitioned to electronic files) so you don't need to give them any old information. What they are going to look at is whether you have seen any substantial improvement since 2005.  I'm not going to lie, lack of treatment will hurt your case. I'm not saying that it means you will  be ceased, but one big 'red flag' for CDRs is when a person is not getting treatment and it is a non-permanent/fluctuating condition. You've been on long enough to be on medicare so can I ask WHY you haven't been getting treatment for a year? Whoever is assigned to your case will ask you that. You may feel that you are still ""super crazy"" but without medical records you don't have anything to back up that statement. They are probably going to end up sending you to an SSA-contracted doctor for an exam. 

Now, this is for you, but also for those who are reading for their own curiosity and/or they are going through their own reviews.  I cannot stress this enough, but even once you are on disability you NEED TO CONTINUE TO GET TREATMENT. Lack of treatment is the #1 (and 2 and 3) reason that a person will get medically ceased. Obviously there are exceptions to this, but if you are so ill that you cannot work then there would be a need for treatment especially when you have medicare/medicaid. 

I know what you are going to say, but RambleRamble, the meds don't help, I don't like the side effects, I can't find a therapist I like, etc etc. Those are all valid concerns and can be considered but that does not mean that failure to get some sort of treatment will be 100% excused. This goes double for mental health impairments since those typically see the most response to consistent treatment. 

But, to put your mind at ease, less than 1% of people who get put on disability are ever medically ceased (assuming that if they are ceased at the first level of CDR review that they appeal through a hearings level) due to improvement. The system is incredibly rigged to the point that it is almost impossible to kick someone off benefits unless there is significant work activity, incarceration, or evidence that benefits were obtained fraudulently. With all of the fiscal problems that SSDI/SSI trust funds are having I would expect that within the next 10 years they will change the rules to make medical cessations easier (there is already a huge push to do more medical reviews annually).",8,,8,0,0,

 - You're not really disabled. You're just fat. (Unlike these idjits, the SSA-supplied doctors who spent quality time examining me determined that yes, I'm actually disabled.)

 - You'd be able to walk fine if you just lost weight.  (Multiple doctors all agree - weight loss would have zero effect on this issue.) 

 - You could work full time if you wanted to. You're just lazy. (I have a p/t job that lets me set my own hours and work from home. It's perfect.)

 - (like /u/dae8b99f-9bd2-4647-9158-3e74d04ee77e hears) You're lazy and you're draining My Tax Dollars because you don't want to work.  (I'm on SSDI, too, and I paid into this fund just like most other workers in the US.  And even if I was on SSI instead, *bite me*.)

178b05b1-a29a-421d-8ae9-ad56658b4499,1445902544,"There is this really weird thing about being handicapped where there is social pressure from able people to conform to their idea of what your handicap means. It's not a concious thing, but its there. If you are in a wheelchair but you can use your legs, if you are deaf but like language, if you are blind but are a designer, etc etc. If you don't fit in the box, its... weird... And that means you'll get looks or that people will treat you like you are wrong for not conforming to their idea. It really sucks. And its easy to try an avoid these stupid confrontations, since as a handicapped person there's a bunch of stupid confrontations already that you'd rather not have. But if you avoid these confrontations by conforming to their idea of being handicapped, you are essentially making yourself more handicapped. 

As a rule, people don't expect much from anyone with a handicap. It happens at every level. People with ADHD or dyslexia are discouraged from academics, wheelchair users have to explain that wheelchair sports are legit, etc etc. I'm sure people in this sub can come up with some more. This means that you really have to set your own expectations. Only you know what your handicap allows you to do and only you know where you can push it, where you can push yourself to do better. 

I believe that as a handicapped person it is very important to take control of your surroundings. You need to make people understand, because they fundamentally have disconnected views on what your handicap entails. And I think you have the right to make people uncomfortable with what they say and do to you. To connect it to you, I really recognize the ignorance that you are talking about. Sometimes people say it, but most of the time I just see it in their eyes. I'm just on the border between being able to fully walk and using a wheelchair, so that means I do both. Walking is very tiring for me though, so if I walk, I am a lot less energetic. It's not my goal to make people feel bad. I would say that 95% of the time, when it doesn't matter, I don't care if someone says something that makes me say 'wtf' in my head. You get used to it.

ca2d5ddf-11bc-4597-abb5-d3f7ae707019,1445875232,"I didn't know about the surgical decisions of this family but I was aware of the  brace she made.  Her brace has helped a lot of children with severe brain damage maintain posture and by all accounts far more comfortable then a TLSO.   

When I first heard about this procedure it was a US case out of Washington state.   I thought the surgeries and hormones were horrible.   I am still not in favor of it but I am not as against it as I used to be.   

I have had to face similar decisions with my son and opted to let his syndrome naturally stunt his growth vs pursuing growth hormone therapy.   My son is severely disabled also and yes sometimes he gets left out of family functions because of his increased weight &amp; size and yes we do not leave the house as often as we did when he was smaller and easier to handle.  

It isn't realistic to expect caregivers to handle a totally dependent infant/toddler sized person the same as they would an adult sized totally dependent person.  I'm not trying to be ugly but you have to be realistic because we are human with human limitations.  

The other concern is that we parents are aging and cannot continue to lift significant amounts of weight into out 60's, 70's and up.   We face realities where we have to decide when, not if, but when to put a child needing total care in a nursing home because of these issues.    Unfortunately, many of these children are far too disabled to move into a group homes because they are total care with significant medical problems.   Keeping a child small may postpone this ugly reality a decade or longer but it will eventually become a reality unless a younger member of the family steps up to the task.  Most stories, I hear about this type of transition do not have happy endings; not that it matters in our case since I am the youngest member in my family other then my son so there is no one to pass on the care giving responsibility to.

The states tries to address the issue of aging caregivers by allowing medical fostering and adoption of disabled adults but it isn't a solution we as parents can rely on. ",3,,3,0,0,

1. Don't be afraid to put in extra info on additional sheets of paper.
1. Provide additional evidence, such as a spreadsheet with a log of how often you go out, how far you walk before pain starts, how long you can go before needing to stop and take a rest, and if there are times when you need to leave the house (e.g. to get food, go to the Post Office) but can't due to the pain.
1. Something like 70% of cases are successful on appeal. That is, they're initially rejected, but then that rejection is overturned. So if you don't have success at first, don't lose hope! Treat the appeal meeting as a job interview - go in nice clothes, do some prep, practice with people.
1. Pick one or two categories you think you meet and really push them. For me, I couldn't cook a whole meal from fresh ingredients (due to pain in my hands and legs from standing, cold water being painful, etc.) which was one of the criteria for the lower care component of DLA. So I mentioned this specifically and kept mentioning it. 
(Small side note: I did the same when applying for my free bus pass. I got a letter from my GP saying that due to my chronic fatigue syndrome and the side effects from the many drugs I'm on, DVLA wouldn't give me a driving licence. This is one of the very specific requirements to get a free bus pass, so I pushed that over and over. I didn't even mention the inability to walk long distances, as that's a very vague thing to claim. I got a letter saying I couldn't drive, which was incredibly specific, and they couldn't deny me a free bus pass because I met this very clear requirement.)
1. Take a look at Benefits and Work: http://www.benefitsandwork.co.uk/ It was a really helpfully website for me, check it out.
1. I'm dreading having to switch over my DLA to PIP, but I've taken a look at the PIP requirements, and I think I can focus on one or two of the requirements. Try to do that, focus on those requirements, and hammer them home.

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1446059289,"I think that you and I are approaching the problem using the same anecdotes/beliefs systems so really we are going to have to agree to disagree on some things. But I think that overall we still share the same goals and feelings on the subject even if we approach them in a different way. 

I want to see the SSDI fund be solvent and continue to be able to function as it is supposed to be and I think that you do as well. However, I am also extremely pragmatic when it comes to how we do that. You would prefer tax increases (presumably from the FICA taxes) to pay for the short-comings. Politically I think that is not going to happen since any increase in FICA is likely going to go RIB (retirement) benefits as everybody uses those and people would rather (my opinion) see their retirement protected rather than ""someone elses'"" disability benefits. Yes, that is a political ideology but that is also a political *reality*, at least at this juncture. 

I think that it is disingenuous to assume that those of us work for SSDI are just out to screw people. I don't know how often you are on this sub, but I'm sure that you'll find in a lot of posts about SSDI I am there commenting and trying to provide advice where I can. I get a few private messages per week from people asking for help and advice. I spend all day dealing with this stuff yet I spend my free time helping people when I can. Sometimes people may not like the information I give them but I am not going to sugar coat things for people.

You claim I make sweeping generalizations, which may be true but this is also what I do for a living. I think that it is great that you are such an advocate for the disabled community, but do not think that I don't share your sentiment. 

I used to work in community mental health as a social worker, case worker, I was a rep payee for people on disability, I worked in group homes, and I managed community disability agencies. Do you want to know why I no longer do those things? I, like many people in this sub, got injured and developed a debilitating back condition. So do not think that I do not understand people's plights and sentiments on this sub. Based on how my condition is already deteriorating further I will be lucky to make it to full retirement age and still be able to work. Hell, I'll be lucky to hit 40. 

I think that in the end we just come from 2 different perspectives on the matter. I have enough insight to know that I have my biases from working in the system. You can't do what I do and not get a bit cynical and hardened to someone's situations. But, I also think you surround yourself in the 'disability community' which tends to be on the more severe end of those who apply for, and are granted, disability. When I say that people who are on that don't deserve it I am not necessarily talking about the people you work with. I'm talking about those who get fired from their jobs or decide to just stop working and then file for disability and because they are older they get put on benefits. This happens on a daily basis. I'm talking about a 19y/o who has never even attempted to work and just doesn't ""feel"" like they would be able to hold a job. That is where I'm sure you and I can come to an agreement that the system needs to change. Fraud and abuse aren't as rampant as 60 Minutes makes it sound, but it is still fairly common occurrence that wastes BILLIONS of dollars per year which should be going to making sure those that are actually deserving of benefits get them.

I hang out in the bars during happy hours to catch up on local stuff, and there's certain people who make comments to my face, about how I shouldn't be spending their money, in a bar.

""If you can sit in the bar and drink, you can work for that money.""

There is no argument that will work on them, at all, ever. I just make sure to drink extra, when they are around. Sometimes I will go to the cafe next door, and buy a twenty dollar steak, bring it in, and eat it in front of them.

13f144ec-c421-45fc-b384-949218baebf3,1445693067,"HI! 

As you know those with CP cover a wide range of abilities.

I have a ""minor"" case of CP. I am 42 years old. I have been diagnosed with CP since birth. UP until i was 13 I wore a brace on my right leg. 

I am also deaf (no hearing in my left ear, 1/4th in right)

1) on the physical stuff. It mainly effected my right side. My right ankle is really messed up. I walk on my toes and this has over the years caused more issues. The bone from my  knee to my ankle is 2 inches shorter then the left side. so my right leg is 2 inches shorter then my left. this causes issues with my gait. this has caused pretty bad damage to my hips and lower back. now at 42 anything past a mile is major pain.

As a kid i was smaller then other kids. but physically I didn't let my CP slow me down. I participated in many sports wich was against my doctors orders. he didn't want me to do any but my mom figured i should enjoy my youth. My favorite was wrestling. I started at 6 and was pretty good. I worked hard and while did very well I had to adjust how i did it since my right leg was almost useless. As a Senior in high school i wrestled at 103lbs. At the age of around 25 my health really started to go down. the damage done to my hip/lower back really limits mobility and causes a lot of pain.,

2) nothing to report!

3) I should mention I have also been diagnosed with Fibromylagia. My memory retention has dropped over the years. In high school and college I could read a section on a subject and recite it back darn near word for word. Now my short term memory is terrible. I have to write down notes through the day to do things i need. At least until it becomes routine. My long term memory is still good though. I have found i also have a issue saying what I want. As you may have noticed i have issues with spelling and written language (i won't say how long this  has taken me to do or how many times LOL).

4) ugh. communication. I suck at it. Both verbal and written. While i have a profound hearing loss i can communicate 1 on 1. Though i sound like a drunk 12 yr old girl (from what i am told). Sometimes i have a hard time saying something how i want. Same happens in writing. sometimes the idea just won't come out no matter how many times i explain it.

5) this one sucks too. I moved a lot as a youth. we never really stayed in one place until i was 14. So i never really had many friends.  With my communication ability's it was always hard. Though i did make some and i am still friends with them today. As an adult i find it very hard to make friends. I just do not have that ability to talk to other adults. I just blank out on what to say or anxiaty gets me where i can't. Either way most of my time as an adult is on the computer (woooo! ....)


6) I used to know damn well everything you wanted to know about computers. In the 90's this got me a ton of jobs and people for some reason expected computer guys to be socially inept. so it worked great!

as i said my health took a deep dive around 25. i tried working but would have to take time off and people don't like that. so i would get fired. Finally filled for SSDI and got it.

The reality of the situation is that the SSDI trust fund is running out. We can argue about why and how we got here but the focus needs to be on solutions. The fact of it is that the SSDI program is going to have to be over-hauled significantly in the next few years. Eligibility requirements need to be tightened. I know it may not seem like it, but the program is really rigged towards older people and it is actually pretty easy for anyone over the age of 55 to get on disability when they shouldn't be. Technology for work and medical advancements are so much better than they were when the program rules were last changed so we just need to adjust for it.",1,,1,0,0,

I have all of my paperwork (including timestamp dated paperwork) fairly organized, but I will organize it more so. I understand that the system is overloaded with applications, both from disabled persons and fakers. 

I had a hard time coming to terms with the fact that I need help financially to overcome this obstacle, but I have seen so many people take advantage of this system it made me doubt my need. I struggled in Pennsylvania for two years, including committing myself to psychiatric wards four times, before moving back home and accepting that I need help. My brother has cerebral palsy and I think growing up with that made it hard to accept that my mental illnesses are in fact a disability, even though most people can't see it unless I'm having a full blown panic attack. 

I'll be looking for a disability advocate. I've read much of the literature on disability and SSI in NY but I'm still fairly lost, as you can see. Are there specific ways one looks for a disability advocate? 

Again, thank you so much for sharing your story and educating me. I hope to be off of it within a two year time frame, as the panic disorder and agoraphobia are both treatable with therapy and exposure.

My husband has spent time in Seattle, but only on vacation, and I think that learning more about what it is like to actually live there- ideally from someone who is aware of various types of accessibility barriers- is crucial knowledge. Hopefully someone can weigh in on these cities and get you some idea of what it would be like. 

I really do love Ann Arbor- as you can likely tell. It is just the right size for me. There are always interesting new people to meet and things to do, but getting places is simple and the lifestyle is more affordable than when I was on the East Coast. Little things like wonderful parks within the city, lots of really good family run (non-chain) restaurants, and a killer public library system, really compel me to stay in the area. 

When I had to partially retire from training horses, I worked in the leasing industry in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, and helped people find apartments that met their needs/budget. It was not my dream gig or anything, but I learned so much about the area and about renting near Ann Arbor. I no longer work in that industry, but if you do decide to seriously consider the region, I would be happy to make some housing suggestions depending on your budget and desires (pets, first floor, under 1,000, etc). 

Definitely make sure that the area has features that would make you happy. As much as I love it here, it's a unique little world in and of itself, and it isn't everyone's cup of tea :) .. and also consider researching Ypsilanti further, since they share public transportation but are very different cities. Ypsilanti is far less populated and has more problems financially, but it's really an interesting place. It's very down to earth, home to Eastern Michigan University, and full of beautiful historic homes. 
I'm partial to living in Ypsi and playing in A2 :) 

Also hopefully you don't have to hang out at hospitals or doctors offices too often/ever, but UofM is excellent and St Joseph Mercy is a much smaller private hospital in Ypsilanti that is great for minor emergencies and a short wait. 

Do you have particular passions or interests you are looking to pursue in your new home? Ensuring that your hobbies and occupations are readily available in your new town seems like a really important requirement to me..

All the best wishes &amp; keep us posted, eh?

It might be, but it could also be your resume. Does it reflect all of your skills? Do you write a customized cover letter that details your skills/qualifications for each position you apply to?

Often, my clients will come in and what they need most is a resume package that truly reflects their skills and qualifications along with the tools to address their disability to their employer. Making accommodations for people with disabilities just makes good economic sense for employers.  With the aging population, it just more people will benefit from these improvements/modifications/accommodations.
At the end of the day, the employer wants to know that the individual they hire is the best candidate and will be a loyal/hardworking employee.

If you can do a meal in the microwave but not on the hob you get 2 points on PIP towards Daily Living. I know because nearly everything I eat is bunged in the microwave and so I get those two points. It's a staged point system and in that section you can get up to 8. Beyond the microwave it's can't cook at all without physical assistance and can't cook full stop.

You can google them if you're unfamiliar. 

Assuming that a person doesn't meet/equal a blue book listing (which only maybe 10% of allowances do) the decision comes down to their Residual Functional Capacity and where they fall on the med/voc chart (which also takes into consideration their past work and educational level).  Most people get 1 of 3 levels of RFC: medium, light, and sedentary. Except for a very few rare situations at Medium will always deny up to age 60; a light will always deny up to age 55; and a sedentary will always deny up to age 50. If you take two people identical conditions but different ages the decision will be different based on their age. THAT is why I say that it is *generally* easier the older you get. 

You claim that my information is bias, but your assertions are biased based on your specific experience with the system. Most people who apply for disability really do think that they are disabled as *they* define it rather than as SSA defines it. It has to be a very limited definition for a reason; the system is unsustainable as it currently stands especially with all the baby boomers getting older. In my experience (again, take it for what you will I guess) the main reason that people get denied benefits is that there is just a lack of medical documentation of their condition from the providers. There is a lot lost in translation between the appointment and the medical records. ",3,,3,0,0,

7dfa93f1-b4ca-4f21-9908-d574d170abee,1445961869,"The only huge problem for screen-readers on Reddit is that we have absolutely no way to tell how deeply nested a comment is in a thread.  I just have to guess from context.  Unfortunately, I don't think anything can be done with this by themes.  Reddit themselves need to make the comments nested lists or something, so the screen-reader can tell when it goes up and down a level.  Maybe a GreaseMonkey script could fix this, but I don't have the time to figure that out.  But if that could happen, it would be a huge step, and make Reddit entirely screen-reader accessible.  Otherwise, Reddit already uses landmarks to help skipping through the website, and all of the buttons are correctly labeled.  They do have a CAPTCHA for posting comments that isn't accessible, but they can exempt blind people from filling that out if you contact them.  At /r/blind we have instructions for doing this when you post to our sub; perhaps one of the mods here could take a look at those and do the same?  

A tiny ""nice to have"" option that I think could be done with CSS would be ""hide images"". Clicking that would just hide all posts from imgur.com.  It wouldn't make them accessible, but at least I wouldn't have to be bothered by them.

But also, this is exactly why provision of caregiving services and public accessibility are so damn critical. When family members are expected to be unpaid caregivers indefinitely, I can see how they are going to take steps to make caregiving more viable for themselves on a long-term basis, including minimizing the weight involved in transfers, etc, especially when there are inadequate options accessibility in public spaces. 

Ideally, one would want this family to have access to paid, professional caregivers to manage the physical aspects of care and to prevent the caregiver burnout that so often happens when families are in charge of care. Then maybe they wouldn't have felt the need to alter their daughter's body to make caring for her more possible and respect her bodily autonomy to a greater extent.

Growth attenuation makes me uncomfortable for a number of reasons as a disabled person, but I'd rather focus on the social systems that force families into making these uncomfortable choices than engaging in blaming or defending the individual parents who make them. There are a *bunch* of reasons for nations to get their shit together with social services and accessibility, and this is just one among many.",7,,7,0,0,

If you have a good reason to draw upon SSDI benefits, an official should recognize that. However, the system is overburdened with applicants/beneficiaries who can work, but choose to take what is not currently theirs to take.

I worked for 20 years, paid into the SSDI fund, and I made my case about needing help. I did what was asked of me and was approved the 1st time -without legal aid. 

I was recently told that my current review was ""not continuing at this time"" which according to my research, basically means I was re-approved for another 5-7 years. I did what the SSA asked me to do when I got the review notice about 3 months ago.  

Granted, I write much better than I speak or present in public; few people believe I am intelligent, and many think I am a ""retard"". A lifetime of mental health conditions has basically produced a classic, schizotypal misfit; I wear the same clothes for months at a time, I have hygiene issues, but I eat right and keep my attic living space clean. 

I cannot participate in the modern working environment; I am already fired because the ""speed of business"" will melt me. I can tolerate difficult situations, but that ability is limited. I need solitude to survive, and thus I am a shut-in. 

You can earn less than $1000 a month and still qualify for benefits. I advise people to do what they can to find work; SSDI is poverty for those of us who are unable to work. Personally, I do well with poverty because I have been poor since I graduated college in 1993. 

I say all this because self-awareness about jurisdiction is very important and factors into what I say above about organization. If you need SSDI, and your case reflects that, then you will be awarded it's benefits. Some people have learned how to ""fake it"" in such a way that they block legitimate applicants: 

I despise disability attorneys who primarily make a living off ""fakers"". 

I do not think you are ""faking it"". I go against my principles and advise you to seek legal aid, because somehow you may be unable to demonstrate your clear, distinct need for SSDI benefits. The right advocate will help you sort out legitimate reasons for appealing a denial. 

Not everyone is visibly ""fugged up"" like I am; I think my initial meeting with a case worker at the SSA office helped me out because of my ingrained behaviors. At the time, I was...ahem...not stable. I have some stability now, but it has to be maintained; I re-boot my self everyday.

4603dfc1-a6c6-441d-8f71-719f862c601d,1446086888,"I agree that we probably agree on some things. I'm a bit of a stickler for speaking clearly about the details, and trying to avoid hyperbole. It tends to foster more productive conversation.

For example, you say:

&gt;You would prefer tax increases (presumably from the FICA taxes) to pay for the short-comings.

I don't know where you get this from, or what I said to indicate this. I didn't make any statement regarding where funds should be allocated from, only that they should be prioritized, as we do with defense and corporate welfare.

This detail is important, because when we inject hyperbole into conversations, we tend to see people as stereotypical versions of our opponents. You have obviously recognized our points of shared values and agreement, but you still characterize some things in a very broad hyperbolic way. This is what I was calling attention to in my previous replies. Another example of this is when you say,

&gt;I think that it is disingenuous to assume that those of us work for SSDI are just out to screw people.

If this is your characterization of what I said, it is a *mischaracterization*. My comments were about the **system** that is set up and its design, and not the people who work within it or their intentions. I worked in public service also, and have a lot of respect for people who do. I appreciate the inside information you have, and your willingness to share it with the community, despite your own challenges.

&gt;However, I am also extremely pragmatic when it comes to how we do that.

I appreciate a pragmatic approach, and used to be more pragmatic myself. I've gotten a bit more philosophical in the decade plus that I've spent mostly in bed. I recognize that it's more of an uphill battle, but I think it's an important perspective to put out there anyway, because ideals are still worth fighting for. They are the stars that guide pragmatist in a general direction.

&gt;Fraud and abuse aren't as rampant as 60 Minutes makes it sound, but it is still fairly common occurrence that wastes BILLIONS of dollars per year 

I thought that fraud and abuse in SSDI were found to be pretty minimal, and that most false claims were winnowed out in the arduous application process? There will always be cases that slip though, but I'd rather have some of that, then have ANY qualified recipients get rejected. Of course, it would be impossible to guarantee this, but the more we minimize both ""false positives and false negatives"" the better, and I think you'd probably agree.

&gt;But, I also think you surround yourself in the 'disability community' which tends to be on the more severe end of those who apply for, and are granted, disability.

Yes, but you're here, in a forum for **us**, not jaded disability examiners, or people who don't meet the SSDI standards for disability. You might want to consider keeping that in mind when you talk to people here, and be more cautious with your wording and judgements.

On a more personal note, I'm sorry for the challenges you are facing. I became seriously chronically ill just before my 30th birthday, and not being able to work anymore was one of the saddest things I had to face, because I loved my job (as a children's librarian).

Honestly, it sounds like you're happy with your relationship and the possible future, but trying to give your parents' concerns a fair listen. Could just be me, but I feel like it's less of a disability question and more of a question of relationships, though question does revolve around your partner's disability.  
     
I would break this down into a couple of categories of questions for yourself:  
  
1. What are your expectations in the future of any possible marriage? Even just looking financially, are you expecting strictly equal income or what kind of divisions of income would you find acceptable?  
   
2. What are your limits of accommodation? Will, Won't, Can, and Can't all should be considered. 
  
3.  A more complex one, but as it's mentioned (parents' doubts on ""supporting a family"", I presume they mean grandkids): Genetic conditions (I have one as well) should be considered when it comes to passing on your genes and even if you choose other options, you may want to seek out advice from other families with parents who have similar conditions to see how they handle it. Again, what are the expectations and are these things you're willing to handle?  
  
5. Are your parents' financially involved in any way currently? Housing? Food? Any of your insurances?  
  
6. Sort of part B of question 1, what are your parents' expectations?  
  
Some of the things I want to mention. Those first two are serious considerations for yourself, regardless of your parents input and should exist in any relationship. Every relationship will have certain accommodations that have to be made. Do your hopes and dreams still work if you have to make accommodations or do you require a sighted partner to live your own life as well? The question for yourself on children, if applicable, should be handled privately between yourself and your partner, and effort should be made to limit the weight of the input of immediate family.  

The last two, about your parents are maybe more reflective of their nature as a whole. In my thoughts, they are putting down an unnecessary prejudice and labeling it as ""concern"", maybe because they don't know any better. By assuming he won't get a job because of his disability they are perpetuating the stereotypes about disability and productivity. Yes, not all of us can or should work, but each individual's conditions and challenges are different and should be considered individually. It's not a bad thing be concerned about the future of any relationship, but their concern in this case doesn't make much sense to me. He's got a regular ""report in to work"" part time job, a freelance ""take care of it yourself"" job, and holding a high GPA in a rigorous field that does really well post graduation. That takes serious skills in resource and time management. Presuming that he's of good character, they don't really have any room to whine in my honest opinion. Maybe from my life being disabled, I feel as though maybe they only see his disability as a bad thing or something to pity while many of us credit our disabilities with pushing us to hone other skills. How strongly do you value your parents' opinions? Will your relationship with them be irrevocably damaged if you continue with your boyfriend? Are your parents prone to suddenly changing the criteria each time it's met? If you dated a guy with not even half the motivation of your boyfriend but sighted, would they be happy? Would you?  
    
Jobs are not easy to get right now, period. Disabled or abled, doesn't matter, you can have qualifications galore and they'll still reject you and it's been that way for the past five years at least. I have always needed a contact to get in any non-min-wage job but I don't disclose my disability or specifics until after the offer. My current job (and probably finally my career) I interviewed for and my service dog was there, no one was too concerned. Depending on your location, if you're in the US and especially if you're near DC, USGov't sectors tend to be VERY interested in people with high performance in math and comp sci, and tend to be a little more open to accommodation than other businesses. It would be smart to have the list of specific accommodations that he uses in the course of his work (headsets? Text reading software?) that can be quickly delivered to HR. It may take a few years to really get his name in there, but it sounds like he'd be making bank.  
  
I have H-EDS, a genetic condition that affects my connective tissues leading to dislocations, pain, fatigue and a slew of other fun effects. When my husband and I got married, he was well aware that the chances of my being able to hold the same level of intense job as him is relatively low due to my fatigue issues, and the fact we won't know from year to year exactly what to expect. We do our best to predict, but we will never know exactly what will happen. The risks that involve my conditions as well as ""normal life"" risks were things he deemed acceptable, and the accommodations he has to make for me were also considered acceptable.  
  
The worst feeling in the world to me is when someone (whether it is someone I dated, or a family member, a friend, or a coworker) has made it apparent they feel I am a burden to them, and they never have to say it.   
  
Your last few sentences make it sound like you've never before considered it to be a burden or a thing that you felt affected your relationship. Presumably your own concerns came to you before you told your parents you were discussing living together and getting married. If your own thought process lead you to thinking this was a good idea BEFORE your parents were involved, thank them for their time, and move in with him.  If you were not sure TO BEGIN WITH and your parents advice has made you even more unsure, then you do, most certainly, owe it to him to let him find someone who IS ok with these accommodations. What happens if you guys decide to spend a year living together just to see if it works for you?   ",1,,1,0,0,

9e0a92a9-59e9-4f94-98ae-2e8a3accd178,1446140985,"Yeah, all my experience is based on DLA. I have deliberately tried to not pay too much attention to the actual nitty gritty of PIP, as it honestly scares me a bit. I'm on indefinite lower care DLA, so I will get ported over to PIP at some point, I don't know exactly when.

Something I will say just to compare DLA and PIP though. You mentioned that needing help to prepare a meal is worth a few points on PIP. If you can do a meal in a microwave, you don't qualify. However under DLA, being able to do a meal in a microwave (but not on the hob) would qualify. And the distances you can walk unaided/aided are shorter under PIP too.

And yes - try to get the help of your local Citizens Advice Bureau. When I applied for DLA, mine was too busy to help, but that was in east London. You might get better luck in a less busier place.",3,,3,0,0,
e038a184-d3ea-496f-9f65-20567dafebfe,1446138032,"Ha, I have just had a meeting with my caseworker about PIP funnily enough. zek0ne has given good general advice but it seems like their knowledge is only based on DLA. The scoring system for PIP is a bit different. 

It's split into two sections, and those two sections into questions. Per question, you get up to a certain number of points, and that number decides if you qualify or not.

For the Mobility section, if you have no mental problems with planning a journey (following bus routes, getting from A to B in your car etc) which I assume not (as you didn't mention it above), you must get 8 points in the physical movement section to qualify for the lower rate. That means you must not be able to walk more than 50 metres *with or without aids*. Aids include crutches, sticks, walker, ortho shoes etc. It does not include wheelchairs. If you can walk 50 metres with aids, you will not get the mobility rate for PIP. For the higher rate you need 12 points, I can't remember the distance you need for that but most 12-pointers are wheelchair users. 

The other section is Daily Living. Again, 8 points or 12 points. It involves things your hips might stop you doing around the house, if you need help with washing, going to the toilet, getting dressed, making food. Again depends very much on your individual circumstances. You don't need to get getting that help at the moment to qualify, for example if your hands are bad and you need help with making a proper meal (I know you don't but first I could think of) but you are currently bunging everything in the microwave, you would still qualify. Write down anything you use to help these tasks, if you're a walker do you sit down, do you have grab rails, do you wear certain clothes that are easier to get on? Anything that you can think of that they affect, put it down. If they don't think it's valid they won't use it, but if you don't write it down they don't know it exists! I suggest taking a day or two after your form to think it over as well, as additional things might occur to you after you've sat and thought through it all.

I can only speak for myself but my assessment was fine, I have another one very soon. I had a nurse, very professional, basically re-asks a lot of the q's on the form and does a physical exam. I qualify for a home assessment so I can't comment on what the centres are like, but I wasn't belittled or demeaned at all. A lot of the questions are very personal, like incontinence questions, so be aware of that if you find talking about that embarrassing. You can take someone with you if you want to and I *think* you can also record it if you ask in advance.



I would suggest you speak to CAB or your local council about it and see if they can have someone help you. I'm happy to help over PM if there are things you want to ask, my DLA was up for renewal just as PIP came out so I've been on it a while now. There can be a loooooooooong gap between your form and your assessment and results so be prepared to not hear for a while - mine was nearly a year the first time around. If you qualify though they do backdate from when the form was sent in which is nice!",5,,5,0,0,

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1444247035,"sorry. i forget sometimes to not use jargon on the sub. What likely happened is that they deemed you to have ""failed"" to respond to their letters so your insurance was ceased. A lot of the benefit/welfare systems will use the date when they first set out the letters/paperwork as the cessation/termination date if you end up failing to perform that task. This often times will affect what remaining benefits a person gets which is why it often works that way. 

An example: Bob is on disability and on 3/20/15 gets sent a letter saying he needs to fill out the form to continue to get his benefits. Bob ignores the letters and SSA stops trying to get him to cooperate on 4/15/15. Since he failed to respond they will go back to when they first made the request of 3/20/15. Using the example of disability when someone is ceased they still get 2 months worth of benefits and insurance as a ""transition"". By saying he failed and ceasing him in March he will only get April/May benefits as opposed to using April as the fail date and he will then still get May/June. The system is in place to prevent people who know they are going to be ceased from stringing the government along to get additional benefits. 

Now, I'm not 100% sure if that is what happened in your case, but that is my best guess based on the information you provided. ",2,,2,0,0,

[Here is the Ticket to Work website](http://www.chooseworkttw.net/), and there's an 800# you can call, too.  

How it works depends on whether you collect SSI or SSDI - with SSI, at first you keep full benefits but then there's a gradual reduction of benefits.  SSDI lets you keep full benefits for nine months but after that has a hard limit above which they stop all of your cash benefits, but they let you keep Medicare for health insurance.

I've never used TTW but I looked into it before I found my current (part-time) job. They don't just evaluate you for what you might be able to do, and help you find a job, they can also do things like help you buy an accessible vehicle to use to get to work.

I wish I could share some experiences with you, but I suspect I am not always am aware participant if someone IS sexualizing my disability. I get asked out a lot and I get some sort of inappropriate comments (particularly considering I'm married).. But usually not openly based on my disability. It doesn't get in the way of me being asked out/hot on, but I don't think it is very frequently fetishized aside from making me noticeable.

I do feel like it is impossible to be seen as separate from the disability which I suppose could mean that any flirtatious encounter is not just between me and that person, but me, my disability, and that person.. If that makes sense. 

I have been asked out by a good looking quadriplegic who would not have asked me out if I wasn't visibly disabled. He saw it as common ground.. But when I explained I was happily married and we became friends instead, he later made some comments that made me feel he may specifically fetishize the disabilities of others. 

He implied he would like to find someone who could share caretakers with him, would appreciate his rehabbed house, etc.. But he also had fantasies about them riding on his lap in his wheelchair, etc. 

while I don't think any of that is weird or abnormal, it does hint at a heavy preference to the point of possible fetishization. 

Let's see, what else... I get a lot of people who overtly comment about my disability while simultaneously hitting on me but I don't know it that is just a way to start a convo with me or an actual interest of theirs, let alone a sexual one. 

Sorry none of this is right on point.. Hit me up with any questions anytime and best of luck on your paper! Definitely would be interested in reading it when you are through :) 
I have worried before about whether there are pictures of myself or my friends with disabilities on certain types of sites, or whether someone's interest as a friend is because of me or because of only the disability (based on strange things they may say, not paranoia ;)), and I think it's important for anyone with a disability to be aware for their own knowledge and protection.

You should be able to qualify for SSI, which is a different but also federally run program. If you have previously applied for SSI, which is either done online at ssa.gov or at a local Social Security office, you can find an attorney who will help you file an appeal.  The attorney will not take any fee until you are accepted into SSI and get you first payment.

However, it sounds like you have been applying for state programs.  State programs vary widely in each state.   In many states, to qualify for Medicaid (or whatever your state calls it), you have to either have children or be qualified as disabled. 

I recommend calling your local office of your state Department of Human Services (apparently called the Department of Children &amp; Family Services in La.) and asking why you were rejected and what is needed to get accepted.  You may require a doctor to certify your disability.   You can also ask them to assign a social worker to you to help you find the assistance you need.

Also, note that in many states, disability payments are usually extremely low. In Michigan they are about $200/month.  SSI payments are capped at about $780 a month.

So re:devotee forums, I only know they exist because I assume there is literally a forum for everything.. but I am not aware of any in particular and I haven't brutalized my google search history yet by looking into that ;) 

I also wanted to mention that I do have a lot of thoughts on sexuality and disability in general, that I didn't really go into because of the scope of your paper re:specific topics..
So I'm not sure if this fits, but I do think that disability impacts sexuality perception and sexuality impacts disability perception. As a woman, I already feel a lot of pressure to be conventionally attractive. Add a visible disability to that, and society tends to perceive it as ""flaw"".. so I feel this intrinsic pressure to be even MORE attractive so as to override said flaw. I feel like I have some responsibility to prove to the world that disability in no way overrides sex appeal.. because all too often, we are desexualized altogether. I feel like I have to go out into the world bright and smiling and beautiful and fit.. and show everyone who sees me that crutches are just a tool like glasses or a handbag, and I'm attractive either way. It's pretty ridiculous, because obviously I have every right to a sweatpants day, and there is no one dictating to me that I need to be a banner for sexuality and disability.. but I'm honestly just sick of the misperceptions. Sure, dating someone with a disability has unique factors, but they aren't always what you would think- and honestly, even other people with disabilities (myself included), make wrong assumptions all of the time.. but it gets exhausting to witness, so putting myself out there as lovely as possible is my current band-aid solution. Re: people I meet, there are generally two ends of the spectrum- the people who say ""you are really attractive even THOUGH you have a disability,"" or ""you are really pretty BECAUSE OF your disability"". I don't feel comfortable with either of those outlooks since they are both based on things that THEY perceive about disability. I would much prefer someone just take things at face value until they actually know better.

No, this is 100% backwards.

Qualification for both SSI and SSDI is, at first, whether you are incapable of working.

SSDI requires you to have paid into the Social Security pool (via FICA taxes from your pay). There's a minimum amount you need to have been working, based on your age, and then a formula determines whether you're financially qualified. 

SSDI payments vary based on how much you paid into them, with a cap of $2263/month (this year), although the average is around $1200.  You can have as many resources as you want, and you can have other income (such as a part-time job) up to $1090/month (this year).  This income limit is a hard limit.

SSI is designed for those who are poor.  You cannot have many resources, excluding a house and a car.  The payments are far smaller than that from SSDI and cap around $780/month. If you want to have any extra income, there's a formula they use to allow you so much income, then above that they reduce your SSI payment by $1 for every $2 earned. 

Because SSI payments are lower, people who qualify for SSI often also qualify for state-based programs such as Medicaid, SNAP, and Section 8 or other housing assistance programs.

This would be a dealbreaker in my job working with clients who bombard me with questions, but for a coder at my company it would be okay. ",2,,2,0,0,

My brother used to be a part of a program where severely disabled young adults (17-20 something I think) would ""work"" for a big box supermarket for free a couple times a week sorting and stocking produce. It was a good thing, it gave them some pride and a feeling of accomplishment and for some of the borderline ones it might have been some form of job training.

At that point it's more like ""support group"" or ""common interest group"" (if there is any, since being disabled isn't an interest) than ""hanging out."" And the general population just starts acting weird when there's more than two cripples around. And personally I'd wonder if you were targeting physically or mentally disabled people, too, since so few places dare advertise to only the former.

If you were my sibling, I'd appreciate it far more if you just developed a friendship with me and took me out to places with you (and maybe your friends). None of this create-a-group stuff. But then, I'm really asocial, and also not a man.

In short: Disability, in my experience at least, has no bearing on who you'd like to make friends with, so I'm not completely sold on the idea. But it is a good and kind one, definitely.

1) Apply online. Gathered every piece of info I could find, from doctor's names and contact info, to every date of every test, diagnosis, and hospital stay.  Details, details, details.

2) Find out that, through a comedy of errors, all of my records are unavailable.  [Original diagnosis doctor's office shut down for a variety of reasons, including poor record keeping; related hospital also shut down, also not for good reason.  Later doctor sold the practice, to someone who sold the practice, to someone who turned it over to a hospital, who apparently lost or destroyed all the records.]

3) SSA sends me to their own doctors for evaluation, all on the government (no cost to me).  Doctors state that it's clear I am disabled.

4) One year later, get acceptance.

I don't know. Is it because I made a good-faith effort to give them every detail I could? Is it because their own doctors saw I'm disabled?  Is it because someone rolled a D20 and I came up 00?

My last job was the only job I ever performed SGA, and I had it for 2 weeks shy of a year (up until the end of March of this year), but before that I've had at least 15 other jobs where I couldn't make it 2 months. My first job I also ended about a month short of a year - though it was only working a day every other week, as I was in placement at the time.

Now, would the onset date for SSI be the date I'm filing for those benefits? Or the first time I filed for benefits? Because I really have no idea when I filed and was denied, my paperwork for all of that is gone. I have almost no ability to travel, so I'm trying to file online again, and right at the beginning, before you actually start the application, it asks (verbatim) ""What date did you become unable to work?""

I guess that's what I'm looking for. I know I need to apply for SSDI as well as SSI even though I'm almost sure I'm not qualified (I've been trying to work for almost 13 years and have only recently found something somewhat manageable and considered SGA but it ended up destroying me), and I tried once going through Binder &amp; Binder, but I guess they only help with SSDI. So I'm also looking into pro-bono legal aid in my area - though it doesn't seem as if they help you apply, only help with an appeal, which I had a problem with last time I applied because I couldn't get to the appeal hearing as it was an hour and a half and a state away, and me with no car or money and no one willing to help wasn't going to make it.

For example, you could end up marrying a perfectly-abled man and he could get into a horrible car accident two years later leaving him mostly paralyzed and brain damaged. Would you dump him then? An equally plausible scenario is that you yourself could be stricken with a disability, by accident or unforeseen genetic happenstance. Truth is, most people will be stricken with a disability of some kind or another during their lives. Not that anything else couldn't happen to him like I've already described, but you already know your boyfriend's physical limitations -- he's legally blind. Yet he's prepared to handle his limitations. He is handling them. He's successfully studying in what should be a profitable job field, even with the rampant discrimination against the blind. The man's working two part-time jobs. That shows he's no slacker and when (not if) he's successful, he'll do fine. True there's no cure for Stargardt's Disease today, but that's the flipside of a life with few to no guarantees--someday in the future there may well be a cure. That future is not set in stone. You're right to be concerned about your future and to think about what your parents have said -- I assume what they are telling you is because they're concerned about you. Yet you're an adult. You make your own decisions and take responsibility for them. For my part, I doubt you'll just be taking care of your boyfriend, especially if he's a hard-working and intelligent man who gives a damn. That's more than can be said of many men, regardless of their eyesight. Couples in healthy relationships take care of each other and make each other happy.

4603dfc1-a6c6-441d-8f71-719f862c601d,1443967895,"What a difficult situation to be in. I have ME/CFS, and while it's different from Fibro, we face many similar challenges. I'm a 40 year old woman who's been sick for 11 years (been with hubby for 15). We decided not to have children because of all the reasons you are concerned about. 

However, as a woman who loves kids, and whose former career was working with them, it's been one of the most challenging things for me to come to terms with. Women are hard-wired by nature to want to have babies, and the loss of that ability (whether one is able to get pregnant or not) can be a long road of grief and acceptance.

There have been lots of times where I have wondered what I would do if it ever happened by accident. I don't have any moral objection to abortion, nevertheless, it would be an incredibly sad and difficult thing to choose, when you really want to have a child.

There are many people who have Fibro, who have children. Some had them before they got sick, and some had them after. Some people do well with pregnancy and feel better during. Some don't and do worse. Many have some kind of crash after the baby is born. 

Some are able to manage caring for a baby and raising a child, and some find it incredibly difficult if not impossible. I belong to a support group for people with Fibro and ME/CFS, where you see everything across the spectrum, from those who have the conditions to make it work, to those who have had to ""give up,"" caring for their child(ren), and have them live with a relative or ex-spouse, or even foster care.

I think it's important to have an honest conversation with your girlfriend about all of your concerns. If you or she has a therpist, it might be good to do it in that kind of a setting. It is **very important** that you acknowledge the difficulty of such a choice, and honor whatever she is going through. She needs to work through her thoughts and feelings and come to a conclusion on her own, without feeling forced into something, or she will always resent you.

However, that doesn't mean you must surrender your needs or point of view. As a caretaker, you have the right to say that **you** feel incapable, or are unwilling to take on the *additional* responsibility of caring for a child, or whatever conclusion you reach. It is important to express that you wish you could, and to share in the grief of the loss of parenthood as well.

Of course, in the end it's her body, and it will be her decision. I'm sure she's probably struggling with all of the same thoughts that you are. Remember that you are partners in working through this, and not adversaries. If you don't think you can handle this conversation between just the two of you without it devolving into something hurtful and ugly, seek the help of a couselor or therapist. 

But don't wait. If she does decide on abortion, sooner is better than later for her physically.

Other things to consider: 

If she is awarded SSDI, they will provide an additional benefit amount for any children. I don't know the specifics about this, but [here's a link to some info](http://www.ssa.gov/planners/disability/dfamily4.html). You may also qualify for spousal benefits (if you get married and you are caring for a child).

There are lots of pages where people talk about Fibro and pregancy, and Fibro and raising children. If you google it, you'll find many resources.

Whatever you end up doing, I wish you both my sincerest empathy for this challenge, and hope that you are able to reach a conclusion that you are both at peace with. Best wishes!

I'm not saying the airline killed her but the stress of her wheelchair incident certainly contributed.  I called ahead, asked about a loaner chair (complicated story, she was traveling, had a medical emergency, didn't have her own chair) and was assured multiple times by the airline that one would be available for her.  We landed.  There were two wheelchair passengers and one chair - while airline employees fought, yes fought with each other, over who would get to use the chair she said screw it and hobbled off the plane (she, too, needed the bathroom.)  Then, they wouldn't let us use a chair to get her from the gate to the restroom so she hobbled to the bathroom.  They did put her on one of those golf cart things to get to the door but that was it.  She stroked out at the curb before ever reaching the car.  Coded in the ambulance and died arriving at the ER.  To this day I wonder what would have happened if she hadn't had to exert all that effort, just to pee and get to the car at the curb, if we'd had the chair they promised us.  Likely she would have died anyway, but what a lousy way to go. ",1,,1,0,0,

I am bipolar and later would find out I'm also Borderline. I had been trying and failing at work for years. Finally, someone who would understand. When the meeting started he asked, ""Have you been cleared to work?"" I didn't know what he meant. I'm on Disability, if I was ""cleared to work"" I wouldn't need to be on Disability. I thought. ""Huh."" So, I lied. ""Sure. All clear."" I wanted him to help me. He asked, ""What do you want to do?"" I replied, ""Can't say, I mean, where would I even fit? I'm regularly depressed and have a hard time taking instruction. It makes me feel like I'm an idiot. I usually quit a job rather than be 'berated' by a superior."" He read the resume through, saw all the one year jobs in all the different fields. He handed me back the resume and said, ""Well, looks like you're good to go. Just take this and look for work like you usually would. When you get a job, make sure you report your earning to us."" Again, I said, ""Huh."" So I did just that, once again landing another job. Typically, it was like I was driving a car without a steering wheel. It wasn't going well. I tried to call Dr. Sachs and set up another appointment to talk about this. He was unavailable.

So I replied:

&gt; You're asking for way too many things. Some of them, I don't even have. And I'm not sure you realized how the events unfolded and how humiliating and incapacitating is to have a must needed wheelchair destroyed. I'll go as far as I have to, to make this right.
&gt; 
&gt; This incident happened when I was attending a neuroconference in Washington DC. The whole trip was for four days, and in those four days I took 6 planes. Three to go and three to come back home. 
&gt; 
&gt; This was not reported by me directly, but allegedly by the crew of the plane my wheelchair was damaged. I have no written report of this incident, because I was quickly hauled away (meaning me seated in an airport old fashioned wheelchair with a guy pushing me almost running)  so I didn't miss the next flight.
&gt; 
&gt; So:

&gt; - There's no written incident report in my posession for the reasons I explained above.
&gt; 
&gt; -Boarding pass: TICKET # XXX date etc
&gt; 
&gt; - As of today, the wheelchair hasn't been sent to repair yet, as I had to wait for your part to tell me how to deal with this. I will now send it to the store so they can tell me IF it can be repaired and follow up with their response.
&gt; 
&gt; Are we on the same page?

Only to have an automated reply saying that I couldn't answer that e-mail directly, and instructions on how to send them a message through their form, which I had to fill **again** (dates, flight number, etc) WTF!!

I have used PASS to help folks fund service dogs several times. Your best bet would be to contact your states Center for Independent Living Center or Vocational Rehabilitation program. Ask them to help you write a PASS to get the dog. The way it would work for you, the plan would allow you to set a side your full SSDI benefit in to the PASS. By doing this you would then be eligible for the full SSI benefit, $733.00 plus any state supplement. You would need to live off the SSI, but you would be getting x number of dollars in SSDI each month to save toward the dog! Also if you do additional fund raising, you can put that money in the PASS without it reducing your monthly benefit amount. Without the PASS, SSA would take one dollar from your benefit amount for every two dollars you raise. This type of plan has worked for many folks who need to accumulate a large amount of money. Money needed to purchase costly items that will help them solve disability related barriers and move them toward becoming self- supporting. I mostly use this plan to help folks get wheelchair accessible vans, but the plan can be used for almost any practical plan.

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1446036863,"to be clear; ALL states use the same federal standards for disability requirements. The reason that the approval rates vary so much from state-to-state have to do more with the culture of the state, prominent industries, average education of the population, etc. 

The only real change I heard is they are going to do away with what are known as ""proto-type states"" of which there are currently 11 I think. In those states, at the initial level for physical assessments, the disability adjudicator can make the decision without input from a medical consultant (a doctor). The adjudicator can also do a fully favorable allowance based on psych conditions without MC input. These states also go straight from initial level to judge level should you appeal.  Non-prototype states go from initial level--reconsideration level--judge level and require doctors to sign off on all cases. 

Now, while it may sound odd to have non-doctors make medical decisions, in my experience this tends to lead to a higher allowance rate than non-prototype states. I've worked in both systems. Prototype states invest so much more into the training of the adjudicators. Aside from requiring a degree in a related field, I went through 2 years of intensive training along with ongoing medical training to keep up with changes in policy and medical advancements. Most Medical Consultants don't get much training on the actual disability rules so their assessments tend to be all over the place. 

If this is about cost-saving measures and quicker decisions Prototype states are also better. The reconsideration level of appeals doesn't really have any higher of an approval rate than the initial level. The first adjudicator would have had to make a pretty significant mistake for that initial decision to get reversed.

Then we are on the same footing. You have a collection of anecdotal evidence from one perspective, and I have a collection of anecdotal evidence from another (from being in communities of disabled people who talk about SSDI on a daily basis, for over a decade.)

&gt;You claim that my information is bias, but your assertions are biased based on your specific experience with the system.

No, my assertion that my *personal* experience of the process being ""anything but easy,"" is anecdotal, not biased. Your comment that it's 

&gt;actually pretty easy for anyone over the age of 55 to get on disability **when they shouldn't be**

is a sweeping judgement of not only results, but worthiness of claims. Just because something isn't documented in the exact way examiners have been taught to determine eligibility, doesn't mean a person should be ineligible, or that they don't **actually meet** the standard for SSDI. It's, as you described, often a technicality based on a medical provider who is unfamiliar or has poor skills when it comes to documenting in the way preferred by SSDI's examination method. 

Offering another approach to **fix or fund** the system, is not based on my personal experience. It's based on my beliefs about what makes a just society, beliefs that I held long before becoming disabled. I would guess that there are other SSDI examiners out there who feel similarly. So, I will not suggest that your views come from your experience as an examiner, but are most likely more intrinsic based on many other factors that make you who you are.

&gt;Most people who apply for disability really do think that they are disabled as they define it rather than as SSA defines it.

Another sweeping generalization. I'm aware that a certain percentage of cases probably fit this description, but **most**? The people you are talking about generally don't pursue SSDI beyond the initial stage. I have read (forgive me, I forget where and can't research it right now,) that a good percentage of those who appeal, and who make it before an ALJ are successful. 

In addition, maybe examiners are taught to deny many cases because the standards and process are broken. You commented on some of this in another post in this thread. It would certainly be wise to examine ways to make the process less odious, while still maintaining certain standards to ensure the program is actually serving people who are too disabled to engage in ""substantial gainful activity.""

However, in my opinion, these standards should not be driven by the *political ideology* that we as a nation ""can't afford"" to properly fund the program so it serves ALL of the disabled people who cannot engage in substantial gainful activity. Affordability is about what we prioritize as a nation. I advocate for making SSDI a priority. I would do so if I had a disability myself, or not.",3,,3,0,0,

I'm from Michigan but have also lived in Maryland and Minnesota, and spent lots of time in the major US cities except for New York and Seattle. I would love to go and just haven't been due to health stuff, so I wanted to preface my experiences a little. 

I have two favorite cities for non-drivers from the ones I have spent most time in, but they are very different from one another and I have found what you like to do/ how you spend your time is very key to where you will be happy. 

My two favorite accessible and fun cities are Washington DC (ok not a city but ya know).. And Ann Arbor, Michigan. 

They are both really fun, full of endless things to do at low to no cost, diverse, have excellent public transportation, sidewalks, programs to promote accessibility. They both have great restaurants and institutes of higher education, etc. 

Some of the key differences to consider are that DC is way bigger than Ann Arbor (affectionately called a2 over here), and so depending on your lifestyle and emotional preferences, this makes a big difference in how you experience each town. Living in DC is more anonymous. You may need to take the train for an hour to get to work  (although this can be a lovely way to get some r&amp;r). Even after you get off at your station, you may still have to travel a ways to your destination. Affordable rent may be in a part of town you don't like so well or is downright unsafe.

But the size factor has an upshot, as well. There are definitely more jobs of greater variety in DC than in Ann Arbor. The public transportation is clean, affordable, and well planned. It's the damn capitol, so you can go to all of the museums, Nat'l Zoo, monuments and Mall for free.. And it's all incredibly accessible and wonderful, with multi media integration to provide an experience that is not solely sight based. There are Jazz shows every night in the Jazz district and restaurants are alive with people at ten pm on a Tuesday- when you are also likely to be able to catch a concert or live performance  that would only ever appear on a Saturday in a2. 

It's a cool place to be and I would recommend considering it. 

That said, the pros and cons of Ann Arbor: 
It has big city stuff to do and people to see but without the actual big city chaos or geographic size. Ann Arbor proper can be pricey to live in, so many people live in its neighboring Ypsilanti (which is also wonderful), and take the bus to and from home each day. The Ann Arbor Public Transportation Authority runs the buses all over both towns all day long and you can check out bus pas rates and routes on their website. You would want to find a house or apartment near a bus stop since the winters here are nothing to sniff at. 
Ann Arbor is a really unusual and hard to describe place. It's an old liberal town full of an odd mix of serious college students, old hippies, entrepreneurs, restauranteurs, lifelong learners, etc etc. There is always something going on. If you want to join a tabletop game night or a political action campaign or a party or a game, you can always find several fun and somehow intimate options in Ann Arbor. 
I went years without driving in the A2/Ypsi region and it's truly ideal. Never too far to go, always well lit, uber or bus or cab or carpool options, etc. 
There are many safe but affordable housing options but do your research. Aside from the bus stop being near, you want to keep in mind that leasing agents are not allowed to tell you if an area is ""safe""'or not. It's against federal fair housing law. 
Since there are less people than in DC, there is less crime than in DC, but there are still better and worse places to live. I know the ropes in that regard so if you ever decided to consider this area in earnest, feel free to hit me up for specifics :) 

I don't know if any of that is helpful, but I hope so :) I found that many other places I lived were too sprawling or didn't have enough accessible things to do. For me, the scale of Ann Arbor is perfect. 
I wish you the best of luck on your search- let us know where you decide to call home!

ALJ's in contrast, ""cherry pick facts"" and ""play doctor"" and  use stuff against claimants. I consider myself one of the good Claims Reps. I do not take BS cases. I just plan every thing as if it is going to court. This is common of lawyers. Sorry for the rant, I am in a rush. ",1,,1,0,0,

I filled in the ""short form"" I got earlier in the summer; last week I got a letter which stated they (SSA) did not need to review my case. Still not 100 percent sure what that means, but reliable research has told me I am renewed for 5-7 years.

I think you have enough documented physical issues; I don't know why an examiner would think you can do steady work. If you have done the footwork, followed instructions, and don't expect the SSA to have any serious questions, then there is a good chance you will continue to receive benefits.

Many of us folks on SSDI can alleviate ""boredom""; some choose not to do it, or just swirl down the drain in various ways. One day when I was not inspired to make an animation/write, I spent some time pulling out debris from between the baseboard and the carpet. 

I take to solitude like a fish to water -not everyone is good at it- but I also am lucky to be interested in daily practice of skills which may help out later if benefits are discontinued. 

I have made the best life I can from chronically low-income in the last 22 years or so; I think everyone can learn to adapt. ",2,,2,0,0,

I can take a couple steps before becoming exhausted and collapsing from pain! but nothing more than just a few. When I'm at the store in a motorized chair and stand up to reach something, people look at me like I'm just in the chair because I'm lazy. Nobody understands that not every single person who uses a chair is paralyzed. Same for if I'm in my regular, manual chair and I use my feet to help me scoot, people look at me like I'm magic. My legs work kinda, but not enough to just go walking around places. Why do people mind so much? ",6,,6,0,0,

And it sounds awesome that they have all those opportunities. But I'll keep DC in thr back of my mind too. It would be fun to go out west(like Portland or Seattle).
