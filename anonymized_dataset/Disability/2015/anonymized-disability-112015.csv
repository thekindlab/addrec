74ef6f7b-a0d3-4235-82e3-d5663eb5da2a,1448569616,"It sucks how people focus on abled parents over Disabled parents (I know depression is a Disability, I'm talking in general).

While it seems like you want to live a fulfilling, independent life *despite* your SMA II (am I getting this right?) and I want to have my Autism, ADHD, and OCD accepted as part of who I am, I can otherwise relate.

It sucks that I am a lower-middle-class teenager in a world not built for my needs. It sucks that people with SMA II don't have caregivers to tend to their needs. It sucks that a lot of rich and upper-middle-class people can't handle that they don't have a ""perfect"" child and kill us.

I also get you about being considered ""unable"" rather than Disabled, being viewed as ""vegetables.""

Despite the huge differences in our Disabilities, I think Disabled groups should unite into one pan-Disability identity. Ableism is ableism, whether you have SMA II, are Autistic, are Bipolar, have Down syndrome, or have epilepsy. I think the underlying assumption among many different forms of ableism is that our lives suck.",1,,1,0,0,

c9691d3e-23af-43e5-8704-67ac14abc496,1448737006,"I agree that rallying support is good.  However I think that going after the label/ venue industry is too broad, and it doesn't focus attention on the perpetuates of the creation of inaccessible environments.  It might be best to contact individual venues and point out the flaws in writing and document their responses or the lack thereof and then if the accessibility issues persist, filing a complaint with the Department of Justice for an ADA violation seems like the next logical step.

&amp;nbsp;

This is something that I would do myself with the venue I've had an issue with if I went to more of these kinds of events.  As of now I'm about to move so going through that process with that venue would take too much of my time.  However when I get where I'm going I would likely pursue this action if I ran into these issues.  I think the trick is handling it on a venue by venue basis.  I wouldn't even be surprised if some of the places are just unaware of the accessibility issues they cause and many would likely be happy to accommodate and change their policies.  I find that when you engage in friendly discussion by pointing out the issues places tend to be more happy to work with you, ~~rather than trying to bring an unannounced wave of anger over a policy they may have not even been aware was causing members of the disabled community issues.~~ *rather than bringing what they may perceive as an unannounced, unexpected, wave of anger on their business for something they may have not been aware of.  This is not to say that people shouldn't have the right to speak out against what is clearly wrong with regards to accessibility, but it's also important to remember that psychologically people are defensive of the things they like, basically it's important to tread lightly in order to get the best result.*

c9691d3e-23af-43e5-8704-67ac14abc496,1448744727,"I have amended my previous statement with better wording.  Basically I think that venues that are out of ADA compliance need to get it together.  I am very for ADA compliance and as we approach 2016 I think that situations where people are being charged extra for accessible seating and parking is beyond absurd.  It's more of a matter of approaching the problem in a way that will make the venue owners feel comfortable.  I don't think anyone would like large amounts of public scrutiny, and for venues that haven't been given enough time and advanced notice that they are out of compliance it may be startling.  For owners that remain in blatant violation I am all for public awareness of the issue, but I personally believe that should be a last ditch effort since the internet has a way of getting quite mean quickly without understanding the full story.

I hope I worded that better than I did last time.  This is good stuff to think about though, and definitely important.",2,,2,0,0,

I could go on for hours about this topic, and the area that I live in. Back in the late 1990's, we went through a severe process of deinstutionalization. Over the years of 1970ish-1998, they started mainstreaming the disabled community, into the general public, through foster homes, group homes, and inclusive activities.

It's currently to the point, where most disabled individuals in Upstate NY, have their own apartment, usually with a roommate. We are openly seen in public, all the time. I run into a few of my disabled brethren, at least two times a day, in a tiny village of 2,500 people, when I'm out walking and visiting local shops.

Seriously, changing the terms doesn't change the thoughts. I had to do person first language training for work.

Can't say patient, they are now clients (involuntary clients of the health system? love it). 

&gt;I’ve also heard about the term “high functioning” used by service providers to deny treatment to people who want it because they aren’t “sick” enough. 

The terminology is not the problem. The lack of resources is. We will just come up with a new term for triaging.

Just want to point something out though - the hearts and minds of the British public have not necessarily changed for the better as a result of the games. The Paralympics in the UK were a wonderful spectacle for all of a few weeks and there are of course many positives to them. However, such events frequently focus on a certain ""type"" of disability and are often used as an example to shame or stigmatize those with other disabilities whilst simultaneously not addressing the real issues that disabled people face every day. There's an atmosphere of ""If you just tried hard enough, if you fought hard enough, you could achieve things on a similar scale to these athletes"". Except not all of us can be athletes, not all of us want to be athletes either. It rightly highlights the achievements of some but it also serves to reinforce stereotypes about others. That's a bit of an aside though.

What I really wanted to say is the following:

- London is still hugely inaccessible, especially now that there is no longer a spotlight on it. I lived in Athens during the Athens paralympics. I can tell you that Athens is just as accessible as London, despite the fact that having a disability in Greece basically means you'll never have any kind of life whatsoever. Only a quarter of tube stations in London are accessible, housing is also still a massive problem for some disabled individuals. It's completely unacceptable to me that such a rich, developed and supposedly progressive country can be comparable to a place like Athens.

- Disabled people across the UK have been subject to some of the harshest cuts to their welfare support in the last few years. Most of this has occurred quietly as the public turns a blind eye or feeds into the lies that we are all benefit scroungers. Recently, some of these cuts have been linked to poor mental health outcomes and suicides by researchers.

People talk about the paralympics as though the disabled community was done some massive favour by the government and the public. The sheer hypocrisy of that is enough to produce several documentaries.

And is September when your check started or in your approval letter did they say something to the effect of ""the earliest date we can establish onset is 9/16/14"".  

Also, are you on just SSDI or are you on SSI too?  I'll try to go through all of the possibilities. The ONLY issue that I would see here is that if you were on SSI and you return to SGA level work prior to 12/9/16.  I am going to assume that your disability onset date is the 9/16/14 for SSDI which means that the 12 month time period has already lapsed and you should be fine. 

When in doubt (and this is just a general rule of thumb for all disability recipients) always contact SSA before you start working (or get in touch with a local benefit advisor) so that you know exactly what your rules and reporting requirements are. Too often people think that SSA just magically knows when you return to work and how much money you  make. While eventually we do get that information it can take years before we realize that you shouldn't have been getting benefits and then you end up in an overpayment situation and/or your benefits could be ceased. SSA really does have a lot of programs in place to encourage working (and I anticipate those to only increase as the budget worsens) but you just need to make sure that you fully understand everything first.

Do not worry about that $780 amount, what you need to worry about is the $1090 SGA amount.

As for the EPE; that is just another work incentive that SSA has.

ef353c24-25c6-4ebd-92a7-de9996c5bf27,1447086789,"Right now businesses have an affirmative obligation to make readily achievable changes to improve accessibility. I get that litigation is expensive for property owners and businesses, but adding a notice requirement allows them the opportunity not to fix anything, ever, until they receive a formal complaint. With this bill, they have 60 days to make any sort of response after receiving the complaint, and then an additional 120 days just to begin working on improvements.

One idea behind the ADA is to provide an integrated, inclusive setting. In other words, if you use a wheelchair, you should be able to go to a new restaurant with the expectation of being able to get in, find a table, and use the bathroom, without making formal complaints and giving 6 months notice before your visit (let alone receiving fines for misquoting the ADA!). No one really wants to make formal complaints or initiate a lawsuit just to visit a coffee shop, that just gets you the stinkeye from the owner every time you return. This bill eviscerates the ability of the ADA to enforce this goal.

Anyway, the DOJ wrote the Accessibility Guidelines to provide bright line rules regarding architectural barriers. If businesses comply with these guidelines, they have a great argument that they are generally ADA-compliant (assuming their policies and procedures are also non-discriminatory). These guidelines have also been integrated into state and local law, as well as most American building codes.

Further, if a court is worried about a particular serial litigant there are other measures in place to prevent them from filing lawsuits without leave of the court.

This bill would greatly reduce ADA lawsuits, but it would also remove any incentive to comply with Title III of the ADA (the part that deals with public accommodations).",2,,2,0,0,

Have you thought about volunteer work?  Maybe your mother has some interest or cause where her disability wouldn't prevent her from helping out in some way.  This might her give motivation too which I think she is lacking.    I'm guessing that because you say she pretty stays at home all day online and watching HGTV.  Plus she hasn't really been trying to do anything to better herself. She's lacking motivation and is probably pretty depressed.  So I'd also find counseling for her.  That actually is the first thing I'd do since the rest will fall inline once she deals with the psychological.
So why not look for counseling services in her area and try and get recommendations from friends/relatives in her area?  I'm not sure where she lives but there are probably some or hopefully 1 that offers services on a sliding scale for those w/ no insurance or low/no income.  She may not want to go but finding the right counselor can really make a big difference!!  There's also a book called Feeling Good by David Burns that I'd highly recommend.

I feel you. I had a '68 bug that I ""restored"" and loved. Many of my weekend adventures involved going for Sunday drives in that car. And most my friends have this iconic image of me driving that bug. 

Well during treatment for my condition I received nerve damage in my leg, losing function in my right foot. One of the hardest moments was realizing I wouldn't drive manual again (I use my left foot for the gas and break now). I put off selling that car for 3 years because it was so rough, but that caused more things to go wrong while it sit in my garage.

So just last month I finally found a new (happy) owner and said my farewell. While getting the car running and prepped for sale, I did learn I could actually drive it despite my non functioning foot, but I would be hurting the rest of the day.

Stay strong. I know how much it hurts to say farewell to driving (edit:manual). But atleast we're still able to drive. And then there's days like today where an accident caused my commute home to take 1.5hrs. If I wasn't in a comfortable car, I wouldn't have made it home.

Some people even push their wheels using the tire and the pushrim when their thumbs are getting sore etc. Custom pushrims like the Natural Fit already exist to mitigate some of this. But even in those cases you still have mud and all sorts of germs being tracked up next to your hands. This gets worse in winter when salt is applied to sidewalks and it starts to build up on your cuffs absolutely ruining your garments. They make gloves and sleeves and things, but you still end up with a lot of gross stuff tracking onto your arms. 
  
Snow in general is a problem for wheelchairs and efficient mobility.

For manual wheelchairs there is usually a tradeoff that has to be made between caster size. Smaller casters are less likely to become stuck when you are in tight poorly designed spaces, though they are also more like to get stuck on cracks in the sidewalk and tip you out. Larger casters are less likely to get stuck, but end up needing more space when things are tight. 
  
Also some people have complained of problems with dog walking. Sometimes your dog will get its own idea about which direction to go and can end up tying you into knots with the leash. There is also the problem of how to efficiently push the chair while holding a leash vs. Having it tied to your chair and ceding control.

My honest experience is that Change.org is not terribly effective at doing much of anything. You're asking for a shift in cultural thinking — where the owners of these clubs/bars are actively thinking of ways to increase accessibility. I believe that some of them genuinely want to, but there simply is any money available for them to do so. And in many cases, if they left the artsy old building that they may be stuck with, they may lose or alienate a lot of their neighborhood customer base (which could be very significant).

My suggestion would be different: connect with music fans locally. Tell them your story. Share this thread with them. Collect stories from others (as you are doing here). Use your narrative to inspire, and if at all possible (remember, these are small business owners, and they are real people!) get to know the owners/decision-makers, and ask if there is any way that maybe the community can help raise money and/or awareness for accessibility construction projects.

Sure, this method may not have been ever tried before, but it sure seems to be the most sensible. I'm afraid if things go the Change.org route, they will simply collect signatures with no real action at all.

Generally my advice is to call SSA when you start working and then periodically check in every 6 mo or so especially if you come anywhere near (I'd say within 300) of SGA levels while working. It's easier to deal with issues as they happen rather than 2-3 years down the line. And ALWAYS keep hard copies of all pay stubs, time cards, etc. at some point people on SSDI and working will have a work review done on their benefits. If that doesn't go well or if there is missing information (or you withhold info from the agency) it can trigger a full medical review of your claim. ",2,,2,0,0,

This causes the brain to develop along a different path from the rest of the body. So while the body might develop male (or female) characteristics, the brain would develop female (or male) characteristics. This mismatch causes distress because the brain wants one mix of hormones but the body produces another. Many transgender people also feel distress from the way their bodies are configured. Again, the brain expects one layout but is housed in a different one. 

Being male or female is much more complicated than just having a penis or a vagina, or XX chromosomes or XY chromosomes. For example, there is a condition called androgen insensitivity syndrome. These are women, undeniably women, who have XY chromosomes. This is because their bodies, right from the very start, actively convert testosterone and other androgens into estrogen and other female hormones. Genes are just the blueprint.

The answer to whether employers consider ""disability"" part of diversity hiring is complicated. Effectively yes but it's somewhat in its own group o classification. There are *far* more incentives to hire a disabled vet than for just hiring someone who is disabled. For one ""veteran"" and ""disabled"" are both considered protected classes by the federal government. In much the same way religion, gender, and race can't be used as determining factors in hiring or firing (people still do it, but it's a very high bar to prove you were discriminated against based on one of these factors.).

When it comes to statistics, people who were disabled before the age of 18 are one of the absolute worst categories for employment. The way our systems set up VR systems only help people who have enough of their own money to chip in towards an employment outcome. Which is fine when someone gets hurt on the job and needs to be retrained.. Not so much when you don't have enough money for a car, live in a town with no public transit, can only afford to go to schools within driving distance of your mother, etc...

I highly recommend that he stop working completely while he is applying. I only say that because it is a ""stronger"" disability case since someone still doing labor at ~20 hours per week is not as believable as someone who is not working at all.  However, if financially that is not possible then just make sure he is below that SGA number. 

At age 60 with only labor work and only a high school education I would say that, assuming the medical records support his statements, he would have an extremely high chance of being approved benefits on the first try. Some will suggest getting a lawyer but I wouldn't, at least not initially. At the initial level lawyers do not really do anything that will help his case. In my experience a lot of lawyers will actually hinder cases at the first two levels of adjudication in order to maximize their payout--but I digress.  As long as your dad can understand the paperwork/process (or have you help him; he can add you as an 'authorized third party' on the application) he will be fine. Most of the paperwork is not difficult to complete.  There is no sense giving a lawyer $6000 when they aren't going to actually do any of the work for you. 

I do hope your dad takes care of himself and applies for benefits. He is the type of person that the system is designed to help. And there is no ""partial disability"" he will either get it or he won't. Again, he sounds like a very strong (I would say 80-90%) just based on your information. I would not recommend trying to ""stick it out"" until he can take early SSA retirement.

The limit is set at a maximum of 25% of the backpay, with a maximum of $6000 total.

Most lawyers do a consultation visit first where they'll ask a barrage of questions before deciding to take the case.

My sister is a bit older than me and always got jealous about me ""getting my way"" growing up. Finally my mom told her, ""Fine, you can't leave the house, or even your room, and can't have sleepovers, or go to parties, or have physical hobbies -- just like your sister."" I think that shut her up a little, but maturity did the most of it. I genuinely wasn't spoiled, but I was definitely treated differently because I had to be.

I'm very selective with who I ask for help from. It's so annoying and tiring to have to constantly ""wait your turn"" for the most basic crap, to have to figure out how to phrase asking for help, to try to navigate the people who help too much or not enough, or those who act angry or annoyed or incredulous that ""LOL *that's* what you need help with?"" **I don't want to ask for help, but I have to. I'm sorry it's a bother, because it's a bother for me, too.** And this isn't just a ""once-a-day, maybe twice at most"" like it is for most people -- *it's all day, every day.*

Independence solves all these problems. Those little steps closer to a normal life helps mend the frustration **(and even depression, which can manifest as anger)** one feels when reliant.

4a701736-cf95-44ba-8c42-4d419c98ed6c,1447351841,"I've been on SSI since I was eighteen, and I know SSDI is different. I'm not sure which you're planning on applying for, but I'll explain the difference as I've understood it.

SSI (Suplimental security income) is for people who have never worked, or haven't paid enough into social security to qualify for SSDI. I was found to be legally blind at age eleven, and have only held one part-time job since, so I get SSI.

SSDI is for people who have paid enough into social security (through their taxes on their paystubs) that they qualify for SSDI income.

I'm not sure about SSI, since I'm not on it, but SSI is reduced by sources of income. Because you're married to her, your income will count against how much SSI will give out. To calculate how much SSI (if any) would be left over, I'd recommend talking to someone at the Social Security office, rather than a disability lawyer. The process of applying was simple enough in 2008 that my parents (a nurse and a sheetmetal worker) were able to help me without consulting a lawyer. 

I've had a good experience with my SSA departments in WI. I'm not sure about other states, but the people were knowledgeable and helpful.

Keep in mind that if neither of you were working, the best she could hope for is around $760 on SSI. I recently got married, and my wife's income of ~1700/month made my SSI go down to ~110/mo. If you qualify for anything, take it, but keep in mind that you'll have a responsibility to report any changes in income. 

Keep in mind, things could be different for you guys on the state level, depending on where you are. 

TL;DR Don't go to a lawyer. Go to the Social Security Administration. If their office is too far away, call them. They can do almost all of it over the phone/through mail.",2,,2,0,0,

I'm actually disappointed in Disability Scoop for one of their quotes, because in the past I've found them a hell of a lot more accepting and understanding of different avenues. Every single thing we do in life is circumstance dependent. What is in the best interests of one person is not in the best interests of another. There are people who are brain dead, or close enough there to that carers have to make a best decision. For them decisions sometimes have to be made, and as someone that has to make those decisions, it pains me - I've cried and ranted and stressed over every decision my family and her doctors have made regarding her care. 

Disability care has a scope, and everyone needs to be aware of how big that scope is. There are folks who are disabled who we will never know are disabled, and live wonderfully independent lives. There are folks midway, who just need a hand here or there, and there are folks who will need care, and decisions made for them every single step of the way. ",3,,3,0,0,

Beyond that I don't have much useful advice.  I wear a $15 hoodie and $2 hat all winter long.  I'm paralyzed from the chest down and use a manual chair.  I can only feel a third of my body, and unless I'm snowmobiling or ice fishing, the only time I spend outside in the winter is going to and from my car.  Or out for a 5-minute cigarette.

I've lived in North Dakota all my life so I am used to the cold.  

I hate winter jackets because they're big and bulky.  I bought one 4 years ago and have probably worn it 3 times since.  They bunch up, are uncomfortable, rub against your tires, and push the side-guards out.  My $15 hoodie from Old Navy gives me much better mobility.  

Gloves!  Gloves, gloves gloves!  Like many others I have poor circulation.  Combine that with -30 degree weather and a metal wheelchair and your hands are going to be in rough shape.  Gloves make all the difference.  They don't need to be anything fancy or expensive.  I often buy an $8 pair of work gloves from Wal-Mart that last me a few winters.  I prefer fingers for dexterity vs. something like mittens.

An auto-start though, that's something I really need to invest in!  Mostly so I'm not late to work.  I can just start the damn thing up once I get out of the shower and by the time I get to my car it will be nice and toasty warm and I don't have to spend time scraping the ice or frost off my windows.  Maybe this year will finally be the year I break down and buy one.

Oh, also, look into something like Verizon's Roadside Assistance.  I have that.  It's $3 a month and they'll do anything from tow your car, change a flat, bring you gas, or even unlock your car if you ever get into a bind.

I would check in with places like Ticket to Work they have programs for people with disabilities. They will need a medical history but then they will help you find a job no cost to you. They then make sure you have all the job aides you need. Maybe you need a set schedule or work nights (not familiar with your condition). 

The first step is knowing you want a job/career/self employed and then setting goals for it. Can you physically do the work? Can you manage your medications and handle the stress from a job. After that get with your doctor on what he can help you with. 

Third get in touch with ticket to work doing this third will help out because you will know you are ready willing and able you will have what the doctor says you need and they will be impressed with your drive. Many people come to them say I want a job then realize they cannot handle it.

In SF, pretty much all buildings open to the public have ramps. Private houses for rent often have a full flight of stairs to the front door though, due to the hills and the high density. Crowd density varies by neighborhood and time of day, but overall it's not nearly as bad as NYC.

BART (the subway for the greater Bay Area) and MUNI (the within-SF public transit) both have occasional issues with elevators at stations being down for repairs, but MUNI only has a handful of stations in their light rail system that require elevators, whereas BART has elevators for all of them. BART posts the status of their elevators on their website, MUNI you have to call and ask.

That said, living in SF proper is getting insanely expensive, even for people who work in tech, so if you get a job there you may end up living in one of the surrounding cities anyhow. Most of those cities are newer, tend not to build up as high and are less dense, so you may find more first floor places for rent, but the flip side is that the multi-story places won't be high enough to have elevators installed. Public transit coverage is not as thorough outside of SF, and making an inter-city trip, especially if it requires transferring between different transit systems, requires planning ahead. ",3,,3,0,0,

I can offer though some reasons why she thought that was true. Generally the SSA exam (known as a CE) is the last step so likely you'll get your letter (award or denial) about 4-6 weeks after your exam. The prescription for the walker may have helped her depending on her age and other impairments but having a walker (or crutches, cane, or other assistive-device) is not going to automatically qualify someone for disability.

If you do have a legit prescription for the walker I would, though, recommend that you take it along. Likely it is in your  medical records from that provider but you never know. All too often (and I'm talking like I see it 1-2x/day) people will come to these exams stating that their doctor prescribed the cane/crutch/brace/wheelchair/etc but there is no record of it in file so we cannot use that information. 

Showing up to an exam with these devices is one of the most common ways that people try to defraud social security which is why having a documented prescription for a device is important. I have seen people who show up to exams with the price tag still on their brand-new cane, walk with the cane on the wrong side, show up in a wheelchair that they rented, and all sorts of other behavior. Often times doctors/office workers will observe people when they are in the waiting room and the parking lot (if they can see from the windows) to see if their behavior changes. I remember one guy who said he couldn't get out of his wheelchair (and refused to try during the exam) but when he left the building he hopped right up, folded up the chair, and carried it to his car.

I have to rely on my cousin to give me what is essentially his overflow work, and the amount of money I have made doing this for the year - and I've only been doing this since spring 2015 - is probably not even enough to be taxed. 

I have been hesitant to go back to school because it would nix my SSI appeal and I do not know if it would even be financially possible with a full Pell Grant, but just today I ran across something that I hadn't seen before in my attempt to find self-sufficiency despite disability: PASS. Plans for Achieving Self-Support. 

https://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/EN-05-11017.pdf 

The pamphlet makes it sound like setting up a plan with Social Security's input could actually result in SSI being rewarded as a part of the Plan. If this was possible, it would be amazing. A full Pell Grant would only cover half the cost of on-campus housing, and due to my anxiety condition, living on campus would be a necessity. Easy access to disability services and other resources, no troubles of dealing with the horrid traffic and parking situations at the Uni here. Now, Social Security might just decide that my ""career goal"" is high apple pies in the sky. Simply put, writing and editing is something I can do well. Deadline-based assignments are something I can actually demonstrably do under the constraints of my disability. I just don't have the qualifications to do it on my own. If there was some program that could foot the bill for a year of academic expenses, I could complete my BA and have the qualifications I need to do the thing I know I can do and get out of my parent's house.

The total suspicion and disbelief of the admin judge of the severity of my condition is despair-inducing. It is also very ironic because the State of Washington, where I live, does recognize that I have a disability and provides ABD and SNAP so that I can have some extremely limited autonomy under my parent's roof. I have autism spectrum anxiety disorder (formerly classified as Aspergers Syndrome under the DSM), depression, and chronic insomnia. None of these things on their own is very severe, but add them all up and they can be overwhelming. Being told by so many people in my life that ""I'm not trying hard enough"" and to essentially also be told that by a Fedral SSI judge... it's enough to make me borderline suicidal. Seriously. I've been going to counseling. I've made breakthroughs. Breakthroughs that have been made out to be ""cured."" The system is insane.

Net income is (maybe over simply) defined as the amount that you get on the check.

This means that the IRS has a record showing that you've been making money, but does t have your tax returns, which means that, at least in the eyes of the government, you've been evading your taxes.

If your income is very small, it maybe as simple as filing out some paperwork, but there may be late fees or something. I guess I can't say on that.

The thing that makes a service dog a service dog and not a pet or companion animal is their ability to perform specifically trained tasks that mitigate your disability, and their ability to handle themselves in public well beyond the standard canine good citizen standards. 

Many of these tasks can be taught by standard animal trainers, but you and your doctor or other people with knowledge will have to help determine what these tasks should be. You would also need to work extensively with the trainer yourself in order to learn to provide the appropriate reinforcement for the dog as well as care. 

Sometimes people get a puppy with he express purpose of training him/her as a service dog, and find themselves not only without a dog who can help, but way in over their heads. This is where it would be best to find a trainer who has done this many times before and can help find the right dog as far as personality and abilities are concerned. And private dog training is not cheap, either. 

Definitely start by applying at the appropriate organizations with the help of your doctor, and if that does not pan out, then consider alternatives :)

Prior to that I searched extensively using google (which is probably your best bet). I found many organizations that were location dependent (ie have to live in the area or be willing to commute for training) , some operated throughout the country though.

A lot of them require mandatory ""donations"" of $1000-$5000 and can have a waiting list  anywhere between 1-5 years. Fortunately the organization I'm using didn't require a ""donation' and I started training immediately (so they do exist).

You could also ask your local animal shelters and/or veterinarians if they know of anyone or any organization that trains service dogs.

Also as other users have said, it's not an overnight process. You can't just go to a trainer or organization and leave with a service dog. I've been training with my service for about a year and she is still not ready to take home. Service dogs aren't usually ready to take home until they are about 2 years old (depending on how there training progresses) and can start training at only a few weeks old (socializing skills, etc). I didn't start training with until she was about 1 years old and she is almost 2 now.

There is also a heavy screening process involved. I filled out a good amount of paperwork and my doctor had to write a recommendation for me and I believe they interviewed him too. Had to list previous veterinarians which they interviewed. I was required to have a fenced in backyard and I can't have any other dogs in the household(although that depends on the organization) .  They also sent people out to my house to make sure it was a suitable environment for the dog.

And sometimes the dogs are just ""rentals"", meaning when the dog retires from service work (usually  about 10 years old)  you have to give the dog back to them and then you have to go through the whole process again. ",1,,1,0,0,

I've found that if someone is playing a concert hall/indoor music venue with permanent seating, it can be very difficult to get tickets online for handicapped areas. One local theater makes it appear as though all the handicapped seating is sold out on their website. However! If you call in, I've often found that I get the handicapped seats at the best available price (often balcony, even if they're in the orchestra) and you don't have to pay the exorbitant Ticketmaster fees. Venues are often extremely helpful if you give them the chance.

As for venues without seating... I've been to Cat's Cradle in NC a few times to see Amanda Palmer play. The first time they were in a smaller local that had awesome handicapped seating. The second time, though, it was just one giant open floor and I thought I would be staring at butts all night. Then I saw what they had done:

It was super simple. They'd build a small lifted area along one wall, right next to the stage. It was essentially a handicapped ramp on both ends, but instead of continuing to rise it went up maybe three feet, and then had 30' or so of flat ramp for wheelchair users. It probably cost them $200 in materials, but it made a huge difference for me and the other two wheelchair users, as we were actually able to see the concert.

Also can anyone comment on wheelchair slippers or other things to not spend half the winter with the steam mop?

**Lights:** 

Two bike lights on the front. Highly recommended, helps you stop rolling through dog shit with the early darkness. Also good for finding your keys when you wander home half cut.

**Warmth:**

Layers yo. Those thera-heat things that you remove from the packet and heat automatically are great, light to carry around and they have sticky stuff on the back so you can stick it to your back, shoulders, chest, legs etc. I also have a battery operated heated TeNS machine which is great if a bit chunky.

I use a pair of big headphones (Seindheiser?) that double as earmuffs. They also have a plastic frame so are easy to knock on and off with minimal motor control, which is lowered even more when you're all wrapped up.

Uch. Just no. I wear a normal jacket with velcro sleeves, push them up to the elbow, velcro up tight. Wear cheap tuigrip to cover my forearms and take a plastic bag with a replacement for when they get ick. It is colder but wet sleeves are my pet hate, I'd rather have cold arms.

You don't say her education level or whether she works or goes to school or what, so I'm going to assume at that age she's not able to find a job she can do without a degree of some kind.  You also don't say whether she is able to get out much and see friends in person.  So  I'm guessing she probably has a lot of free time on her hands, and very little social interaction beyond family and facebook.  She probably feels downright trapped in the house.

Does she have any paid caregivers or is it all family, all the time?  At her age she wants desperately to have a normal social life outside of family.  A non-disabled person could just take their phone to their room and text all they want in complete privacy, but she doesn't have that luxury.  Every single text and social interaction has to be negotiated for.  Also, the content of every single text and social interaction has to be filtered through a family member, who may or may not be passing judgment or imposing their own viewpoint.  (Can you imagine what it would have been like if you were trying to negotiate your relationship with your boyfriend solely through text message, with somebody else doing the typing for you?  Think of all the ways that could constrain what you say and how you interact, even if the person was friendly.  Now imagine that person being someone who disapproved of your relationship, or didn't like your boyfriend, or just got surly and resentful from being asked to type yet another text.  Yeah, that wouldn't be much fun for you.)

I never understood why able-bodied people see this as her ""getting her way most of her life"", because from her perspective she's had to negotiate and make compromises all her life. It isn't her physical disability that's frustrating her, it's her dependence on others, and the constant emotional labor it takes to negotiate that.

What she really needs is more independence.  There are ways to operate computers and iPhones more independently, through voice recognition, eye tracking, single switches, or some combination of the above.  How's her voice quality?  Maybe she could use NaturallySpeaking on her computer.  How's her eye movement?  Maybe she could use Tobii or one of the other eye trackers to operate her computer (or Android tablet).  For the iPhone, you can place a button (called a single switch or ability switch) anywhere she can hit it, with an adapter from RJ Cooper or Tecla, and the iPhone software will scan through all choices until she hits the button.  There's also the DragonDictate app that will take dictation and send it as email.  Let us know more about her abilities and I'm sure someone will have ideas.",9,,9,0,0,

I only had to prove long term severe function impairment and it still involved a large stack of documentation from hospitals, therapists, medical tests, school documentation, DME's etc....      My son's SSI for medicaid came through in 48 hours and it took less then a month for them to review the medical files and approve SSI but I did everything for them and my son's functional abilities are extremely low due to severe and multiple impairments from two coinciding genetic syndromes.

**Is it difficult to travel down crowded sidewalks with lots of people/navigate the city?**

Not really any more difficult than walking through large crowds. Most people tend overreact and jump out of the way. 

**What are some of the challenges you face living in a high density area?**

In general, I find that larger cities are remarkably easier to get around in by wheelchair 

**Are there any resources about this? I read John Hockenberry’s Moving Violations, but my mom isn’t young and physically fit. I doubt she will use a manual wheelchair.**

Chicago has several organizations that provide resources to wheelchair users. It depends on what you're specifically looking for 

**People up north, how is the ice a factor? Again, we are from Texas and I worry about her ability to get around on her own while I'm at work.**

If it's really bad, I usually only push from my building to my car, and from my car to school. Otherwise I just end up moving slower. It can be much worse for those in power chairs.

**How do we find an accessible apartment? Zillow has no information on accessibility. I found a few specialty places in NYC, but they were extremely expensive**

Craigslist is the way to go in Chicago. Do not even bother looking for truly accessible apartments. Just find buildings with elevators (anything over 4 stories in Chicago, by code) and see them in person to assess if it will work for you. I've moved three times in Chicago, each time it took less than a month to find and had to visit no more than 10 units. 

**Is there an Uber alternative for disabled people, because I hear Access-a-Ride sucks?**

Nope, not for a heavy power chair. But many of the cabs here use MV1s, which are fantastically accessible. 

**Are there specific wheelchairs for city life?**

I know next to nothing about power chairs.

Crowded sidewalks are not much of an issue for me, people tend to move out of the way of my 300lb wheelchair, and if they don't, well that's their mistake.

In NJ we only get bad ice a few times a winter, so it's not too terrible, but I tend not to go out when its snowing or iced over.

For an apartment you just need to call around, you need to know exactly what you need and make sure the apartment complex has that. Similar to finding a hotel that is handicapped accessible, the website may list it as ADA compliant, but the room might be too small to even get my chair through the entry way.

823d7b88-9468-4ae2-a30d-87be72e99cfa,1446855074,"&gt; Actually, the biggest problem I find in hotels are heavy doors. Or maybe just really rusty/tough hinges, idk. But it really ruins accessibility when I can't even exit the room by myself because the door weighs 5-10lbs. (Pulling a door open is way harder than pushing when in a wheelchair.)

This is usually caused by the closers, which need to be quite strong to get past the acoustic seals.. plus the doors are wide so they are heavy.  we have a delay action closer so it gives a few seconds before it starts closing.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; As for walk-in showers, I appreciate the ones that avoid getting water everywhere. One I really liked had a little niche in it you could direct the showerhead into. And speaking of, I've had a lot of hotels where there were no handheld showerhead or adjustable heights for the showerhead; both of these are essential to me.

The non-adjustable shower head is a mystery to me, people keep proposing it and i have no idea where it comes from. Our standards require the adjustable rails / handheld one
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Higher toilets are always a plus. And well-placed toilet roll; none across the room or behind the toilet or too low or too high whatever awkward place you can dream of.
&gt; 

perrenial problem, especially because you have potential splashing from the shower, some neat flip down rails have the roll holder built-in
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; No high beds, please, though I think that trend is slowly dying. Likewise, two beds are preferred; it's common to put one king bed in a handicap room, but two queens are much nicer and way more flexible.

Bed height is creeping up, but we require wheelchair rooms to be 550mm high (with the gap under the bed for hoist legs)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Oh, and tons of power outlets! Ones that are easily accessible, too, not hidden behind desks and chairs. I have more things to charge than most people, and doing contortions to do so is hard on the body.

Institutions like Bill Graham's live music empire are probably the best target for major act like venues.

If he likes playing with things that kids typically play with, I see absolutely zero reason to make him use 'adult' things. Forcing him/her to do so says a lot more about us than them. I've found taking my sister to the store with me (when she's in the right mood for it) and letting her pick is perfect for identifying what she does and doesn't want. 

OP: I'm not certain how much money you can or will spend, or how he handles things like tablets, but my sister found a great deal of enjoyment out of her iPad. If you invest in a nice set of headphones, they can enjoy hundreds of apps depending on their personal preference (especially auditory ones, which you mention he might like), just makes sure you use the security features to lock out incidental purchases. You can get things like life proof cases to ward against inevitable falls/throws/etc. The headphones allow for as much noise as they want without impacting others (My sister freaking loves Tom the cat, but the noise from that drives us nuts). 

Talk to the respite/care center - they probably do things there that he takes a particular interest in. The family should take an interest in those too, especially activities that can be done together. For instance, the women in my family love puzzle building, including my sister. So we'll get a fairly average sized puzzle and build it together. 

If there are certain things that he has difficulty with, get those as toys. For instance, my sister had issues with finer skills such as lacing a string through a hole - we got her then plastic buttons with fun coloured string so she could play while watching TV. Her fine motor skills increased immensely with this. (For something more family fun friendly, the operation game works well for this). ",6,,6,0,0,

I worked in direct care for 13 years prior to becoming disabled myself, and I've taken care of people who are developmentally disabled to this disagree. The person who was closest to this condition was named Maggie, and she had a lot of physical problems based on the fact she was so disabled mentally. We had to reposition her every 2 hours, day and night, to keep her from developing bed sores. Repositioning a full grown woman every 2 hours by yourself certainly can be done, but difficult to impossible to do without disturbing her, so this lady never got more than 2 hours of uninterrupted sleep, ever. If she were smaller, it would have been easier to move her and to get her in a comfortable position. Any transfers involved a hoyer lift, and she didn't like it. It's amazing how you learn to pick up on someone's emotions when they never speak, move or make eye contact with you. But being suspended in midair made her anxious, I could tell. If she were smaller, someone could just pick her up instead, and she wouldn't have to have that anxiety. In general, a smaller person is so much easier to keep clean and dry, dress, check all areas of skin for developing problems, etc. Her existence is basically a barrage of people touching her and talking to her, and the less of each, the happier she was. So it's not so much about making it easier on the caretakers, because you perform the same cares on cognizant people who may fight with you about it if they feel so inclined, so taking care of someone like Maggie is *already* easier than anyone else. It honestly is about what is going to be better for the person in the long run, and someone in that condition is never going to progress or advance mentally. This treatment is only detrimental if it takes something away from the person, and in these types of cases, it only enhances the quality of life by making long-term care more effective and efficient. I do think it needs to be closely monitored, and only used in very specific cases, because I've also taken care of developmentally disabled people who were profoundly retarded yet still had some capacity for speech, social interaction, and independent mobility. Sure, having them be smaller would make it easier for the caretaker when they were being combative, but it would also take away from their enjoyment in life, so I would be very opposed to it. I had a client who could be a real handful in terms of behavioral issues, and social skills were something we had to reinforce every single day, but he absolutely loved playing basketball in the driveway. For someone like him, this treatment would not be fair, at all. And believe me, the well-being and happiness of my clients was *always* my number one priority, so much that when my useless drunk of a boss forgot to purchase this client a cake for his birthday I went in on my day off and bought him one with my own money because it would have broken his heart if he thought we'd forgotten it. It really comes down to the specifics of a person's condition and what is going to enhance their life further down the road. If someone hasn't developed any cognitive or motor skills by the age of 9 or 10, they never will. It's an unfortunate condition, and I certainly wish we could offer them treatment that would give them some sort of independence in their life, but we simply can't. All we can do is whatever will make their life easier for as long as possible, and this one will do that. And as long as it's only used under the strictest of outlines, I agree with it. ",16,,16,0,0,

But it really ruins accessibility when I can't even exit the room by myself because the door weighs 5-10lbs. (Pulling a door open is way harder than pushing when in a wheelchair.)

As for walk-in showers, I appreciate the ones that avoid getting water everywhere. One I really liked had a little niche in it you could direct the showerhead into. And speaking of, I've had a lot of hotels where there were no handheld showerhead or adjustable heights for the showerhead; both of these are essential to me.

Higher toilets are always a plus. And well-placed toilet roll; none across the room or behind the toilet or too low or too high whatever awkward place you can dream of.

No high beds, please, though I think that trend is slowly dying. Likewise, two beds are preferred; it's common to put one king bed in a handicap room, but two queens are *much* nicer and way more flexible.

How long it takes for your claim to get from the Field Office (FO) to the Disability Determinations Office (DDS) really depends on the state where you live and what their current workloads work like. It can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to get assigned a DDS worker. Some states have what is called a ""pre-development"" unit. As soon as you file they send out all the paperwork while it is waiting to be actually assigned to the decision maker. 

Generally once it gets to the DDS it will still take anywhere from 30-120 days for a determination. They have to request the medical evidence from your doctors (which they get 30 days to respond), sent it for a medical review with a SSA Medical Contractor (MC), do the vocational assessment, and then do the decision. And that doesn't include any additional steps such as sending you to a Consultative Examination or SSA needing to get updated medical records if you go back to the doctor while they have your case. 

The most important thing you can do now is to be cooperative and responsive. Answer your phone when it rings and you don't know the number. Most DDS examiners carry caseloads of over 100 cases so playing phone tag will delay your case several days. Make sure to fill out all paperwork timely (which it sounds like you are) and go to any appointments that they schedule for you.  That paperwork you received should have had an examiners name/phone number on it. At the end of the month I would suggest you call to check on the status of your claim. Make sure they received your paperwork and find out if you had any of your doctors that didn't respond (you may have to get SSA the records yourself). Being proactive about making sure SSA has everything they need can sometimes avoid delays at the back-end of the case.

As I said at the beginning, you still have probably another 1-3 months before you'll get a decision. This time of year things tend to slow down as the people at the DDS and FO go on vacations. And that 1-3 months is just for the DDS examiner to make a decision. Anywhere from 30-50% of all cases get pulled for either state or federal quality review which can take several weeks to process. And from there, if the QA doesn't like the case, they will send it back for additional development by the examiner which will add another 30-60 days as well. ",7,,7,0,0,

Although there's no set in stone definition of what is and isn't a disability the general deciding factor isn't a matter of how difficult it is to have a condition/illness, but whether or not that condition/illness makes you unable to, or have significant difficulty, performing tasks that the majority of society takes for granted.

For example a person who is paraplegic is disabled in that they can't climb stairs without significant difficulty, a person with an anxiety disorder may be disabled in that they are unable to buy food at a store without experiencing fear or panic, an epileptic person is disabled in that they cannot drive a car without great risk, etc.

I'm not trying to dismiss the hardship that transgender people face, I understand that it's no easy thing to deal with. However a transgender person isn't likely to be considered to fit the definition of a disabled individual as their being transgender does not prevent or impair them in what are considered by most as normal day to day tasks.

Take epilepsy as an example. It's a chronic illness that is also a disability. If you're very lucky you can hit on the right mix of medication to treat it with minimal side effects and no longer have any symptoms.

At that point the person is no longer disabled in that they can't, for example, safely climb stairs. You could say that they're disabled in that they need to take medicine regularly, but it's hard to argue that having to take medicine on a regular basis should be classified as a disability.

If your medication is able to return you to ""normal"" ability and health then there's a strong argument to be made that you're no longer disabled. You still have a chronic illness and your disability could return, but until that happens you're not disabled.

------------------------------

Stepping aside from that for a moment, there is a philosophy that disability is caused not by a person's health, but by society being built around the expectation that people should be able to do, or be, certain things. For example the argument would hold that a paraplegic not being able to enter a building isn't due their inability to climb stairs, but because the building was built so that they couldn't access it. Their inability to (easily) climb stairs would be irrelevant if the building had a ramp or an elevator instead. In a world where every building was designed for people in wheelchairs to easily access their inability to climb stairs would no longer be a disability.

To put it in another perspective, imagine if our societies were designed with the assumption that everyone was as physically fit as a olympic-level marathon runner. The average person from our world may very well be disabled in that society, whilst all the 'normal' people are running up and down ten flights of stairs several times a day without breaking a sweat they need to take an elevator, while the average person is running to the shops and back carrying their groceries as they run they need to take their car. They're disabled not because of what they can do, but because society is built around the assumption that people can do more than what they can do.

It's an interesting thought experiment (though not one I feel has a great deal of real world use outside of being a thought experiment), and if you look at it from that perspective you could make a fairly strong argument that transgender people are disabled (or at least face issues similar to disabled people) in that a great deal of issues many of them face are because of what society expects everyone to adhere to. If a transgender person has anxiety about going to a public bathroom is it because they're transgender or because society is built around the assumption that people are cisgendered?

Again, it's not a generally accepted way to define what disability is (though it seems to have gained a fair bit of steam in recent years), so I don't think it really effects whether transgender is (or should) be classified as a disability. But disability or not it is an interesting way to look at any illness/condition and to consider what are intrinsic issues with that illness and what are things that could potentially be solved by changing the society that we live in.",6,,6,0,0,

There is no magic trick to this form. The best thing is to answer honestly. This is the main form where we asses someone's credibility. We will compare it to your medical records so it's in your best interest to match. 

For example, you write down that you can't cook or do any household chores but your medical records show you saying you're mowing your lawn. Or you say you can't walk more than 5 feet or can't even ""count change"". These kinds of answers are what get you denied(or ceased) from disability. 

People always tell you to focus on how your conditions affect your functioning, which is correct but the flip side to that is to make it correct. The more believable you are the better.  80% of people try to over-sell this form which is a mistake. If your statements are inconsistent or not supported by your medical records you'll be dead in the water. It's better to seem ""more functional"" if it matches your records than less functional and have it not match. 

It is always ok to add a supplemental page or explanation if you run out of space. However: 
1. No more than one page
2. Don't include any googled-medical information about your condition (honestly it's insulting to us)
3. Don't beg, plead, or tell me you'll get you congressman involved.  

When in doubt, call the person listed on the form. If you have questions on how to answer he question just call to ask. That is what we are here for. Same if you're going to have it turned in late. We are flexible but you have to let us know. 

Finally, make copies. If you're mailing it in make a copy first. Trust me, it's worth the few bucks to do it. Tens of thousands of these forms are in the mail at this very moment. Things get lost, destroyed, or otherwise misplaced. After you mail/fax it call 7-10 days later to make sure they got it. If they didn't you'll be glad you have that extra copy. ",1,,1,0,0,

But as a former Texan who lived in suburban Houston from adolescence through my mid-20s, I can honestly say that if you are unable to drive in Texas, you are at a monumental disadvantage.

In 2001, I moved to California. (Sacramento, specifically.) I live in a ""walkable"" (rollable!) neighborhood near plenty of transit options. There are even intercity accessible transit options — I can get from Sacramento to San Francisco for under $15 on Megabus (superfast and direct!), without leaving my chair. And if I want to ride in style, Amtrak is extremely disability friendly.

Since moving to California, the whole ""old city buildings equals lack of access"" thing has become a pretty thin excuse.

It isn't black and white, but unfortunately people have this tendency to think you either have a disability or you don't. So in this warped view of thinking, you're either  ""100% disabled or 0% disabled "". This kind of thinking is really, quite jaded. The disabled have good and bad days. Some days are better then others, but that doesn't make their disability any LESS existent. The fact that people try to mitigate a person's disability in terms of its severity or to the extent to which a person is affected is EXTREMELY insensitive in and rude. Why? Because no matter how much a person articulates or explains their disability to a person who is non-disabled or even has a disability similar to theirs NOBODY can every live in that person's exact shoes.

K-12 education was a breeze, as I got everything I needed education-wise, and graduated high school near the top of the class. Struggled through college, getting by on financial aid and a single scholarship. It's been a year since I graduated and I'm still unemployed. I've been struggling for work since 18, and it's only gotten worse every time I've moved to a new place and had to ""prove"" I'm not useless, especially since my vision has only gotten worse.

I've been on SSI since I was 18, and I got married last year to a wonderful woman who is supportive and is willing to help out if I'm unable to find work, so that's good at least. But, my SSI is going down to about 100 bucks, so now I can't even contribute to rent or anything. My last-ditch efforts are to try to write children's books and make home-made soap so I can try to bring something, anything to the table, or else we'll never be able to move forward in life. 

You're absolutely right that it's a perfect storm for poverty, especially since the COLA only raises SSI benefits every...two years or so. I'm sorry but anyone insisting the cost of living hasn't gone up every year is full of shit, and people collecting SSI/SSD aren't wellfare couch potatos that don't try. If the SSA wanted to properly incentivise people with disabilities to work, they'd start SSI/SSD at the equivalent of working 40/week at minimum wage, and then if you work on top of that, they should only take a dollar away from every two dollars you earn. 

At this rate, I'll never be able to financially support a family, never be able to afford a house or work up enough credit to get a decent mortgage, and on top of it all, i've got to prove to every friend and family member that I'm trying my hardest but discrimination is real, and it's really, really fucking difficult to overcome. 

Someone else mentioned section 8 housing, and I'd echo the same advice, just know that a lot of places have minimum and maximum incomes, and you might have to deal with yearly inspections and other bullshit, thereby adding more work to just having a god-damned disability. 

You're absolutely right it's like having a full-time job, even if it's just a sensory disability, because the amount of work you have to do for the social aspect makes every other normal task a battle.

There's a few major differences from my point of view. First of all, my disability will never go away. It can't be fixed, it permeates and affects every aspect of my life, and I can't even hide from it. It'll always be a part of my life, and I've grown to accept that. I'm totally at peace with that.

My gender identity is a whole different ball game. I'm miserable right now, When I look in the mirror. I hate who stares back at me. I thought I could deal with that too, just like my physical disability, but I couldn't. 27 years of trying just made me into a total miserable mess. I eventually accepted that even though it'll probably destabilize my life, I'll take the risk. 

Unlike my disability, there's hope. There's treatment. I'll get better. It's the hardest thing I've ever done, but I've got an appointment to see a doctor about HRT, I've been feminizing my appearance with makeup and clothing, and I've picked out a name, and told my friends I want to go by it. There's so much to do, but I CAN do it.

e58e0b7a-cba4-45a7-8819-1b0601136bc0,1446591026,"  First, she is blessed to be Canadian and have access to universal healthcare, the financial burden in the U.S. is so cruel and damaging to families.
 
 With RA since 12yrs, male, and now mid-forties and a little less scared of anything, my best advice is to learn to be a better patient. Change your lifestyle and be the biggest contributor to your health, doctors respect this and will see you as a good investment for treatment. Because our healthcare system does not form priority by willingness and ability to pay, I honestly as witness with change in my own attitude can say if you don't invest personally into your healthcare don't expect the doctors to invest much in you. 
 Patient needs to think of themselves like athletes competing for position on a team. What level of competition and team depends on the athletes dedication, training, education, and ability to play with others. In Canada everyone has the right to play but if you don't show up for practice, eat garbage, smoke, drink, and blame the coach's bias as reason you don't get to play in the game, then you're destiny in the game will be on the bench or you drop out and bitch that the game is slanted against you like all the has-bins and loud mouth know-it-alls at the sports bar. 
 Coaches like doctors can see which players are really trying and good coaches will work in some game time for even the least skilled but hardest working players. If she can show her best effort in lifestyle and holds her head high knowing she is honestly doing everything she can, then people will open doors for her. 
 You cannot make her do it, do not be an enabler, and don't let her drag you into misery. My best analogy for living with someone with RA is like living with an alcoholic. They know they have to quit to live and they know it affects all those around them but they have a problem that deep inside is up to them to solve. They will try for a while then relapse, they may binge in misery, say they hate you when you know they don't. There is never a cure but there is the sobriety of knowing when they're clean they can hold their head up with pride, knowing they've seen the devil and looked him straight in the eye.
 
Welcome to Canada.
 Where a Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian.

I think there need to be guidelines in place, such as to ensure that people who could possibly gain function or the mental capacity to properly care for themselves once they hit puberty. I don't think it should be done on people without permanent physical impairment... Such as Ashley in the story. I had a neighbor whose daughter was similar to Ashley. Can't communicate, can't walk or even voluntarily move. Her parents had to do everything for her. She required a feeding tube. She will be like that the rest of her life. They had to move because her parents couldn't carry her up the stairs any longer. It was so sad. 

I can see how it's incredibly helpful.  Like I said I don't disagree with this type of treatment, but it needs to be carefully applied and regulated to not violate rights of those who while still disabled, have the function and ability to make that decision for themselves. ",9,,9,0,0,

My own similarly disabled sibling likes to play with real things like a normal person, that could be part of the reason he's using those specific items. If you can find plastic tools and play utensils those may be a good idea. You also mentioned he likes tidying up and my sibling ***loves*** cleaning stuff as well, though it seems cruel and unusual to outsiders, they're content to sweep for hours for example and love new brooms and dustpans. Obviously avoid anything that involves cleaning with chemicals. Rakes for leaves are good in the fall. 

As for being plopped in from of the TV at night, that's at least partially unavoidable if your bf's mother is a 50 or 60 something single parent who presumably works. It's incredibly difficult to keep up with the active lifestyle of a normal 20-year old at that age. My own sibling is a two or three person full time job even with additional limiting physical abilities and a weekday day program. We keep her entertained with live-action children's movies when you just can't do anything else. The best gift you could likely get both of them is to take him out on your own one or two nights a week. As a sidenote, you may also want to inquire with your local Department of Social Services as to whether there are any afternoon or evening programs available in your area for the disabled or if they will fund private care for some number of hours each month.",10,,10,0,0,
37f84417-f829-4671-99d3-7ee8393787ad,1448561514,"I really feel you. This whole article made me shudder and reminded me of a recent UK case where an *affluent* mother killed her 3 children who had SMA II. She was convicted of ""manslaughter by diminished capability"". It absolutely enraged me that the entire case was focused around her depression and how AWFUL it was for her and how SMA II is so terribly debilitating that duh it makes sense you'd want to kill your own children. Very little was said about how individuals with SMA II can lead very fulfilling, independent lives with the right support. I'm a fucking scientist for goodness sake, another friend of mine is in a high position at a well-known TV channel here in the UK whilst another friend is a practicing psychologist. No, none of how these 3 kids had their entire potential snuffed out by a fucking psychopath when they hadn't even asked for it. Just a pity party for the mum and how hard it was for her - barely any mention of the children she *murdered*.

As someone with SMA II and who knows other people who have multiple children with SMA II, what we wouldn't fucking give to be rich like that family and have the best treatment and support available to us. So much of the issue with having a disability is how freaking expensive it is and how that burdens the family and adds to the physical and emotional toll. If my parents had the money these people had they would have hired help to give us a more calm family life and get a good night of sleep occasionally without having to wake up like 3 times a night to turn me over. Now, my parents weren't perfect at how they handled my disability but they also both worked full time jobs (my mother was both my carer and a teacher and my dad worked 12 hour days to get us to a point where we were financially able to get the equipment I needed). If this stay at home mum was so burdened and depressed, why didn't her husband or her hire a carer to assist?  I just don't fucking understand this shit. 

So sorry - rant over. In essence, like you say, fuck the people who excuse murder like this, fuck being viewed as ""vegetables"", fuck people denying our very right to existence, fuck all of that.  ",1,,1,0,0,

I just wanted to point out that this young man is an adult, and you should consider his dignity when choosing a toy - in the relationships thread especially some people were suggesting very childish toddler items which might not be appropriate.  
This may or may not be important to him and his parents, and can be a point of contention within families (so the mum might have told you that they don't have time to play, rather than she feels playtime is too childish, to avoid having to justify this to you). Lots of adults do enjoy childish things, but you're not buying your boyfriend any toddler toys or expecting his parents to do playtime with him - it'd be insulting given his age.

That doesn't mean he shouldn't be able to access sensory toys or stimulation, just that you need to choose carefully and not just buy things made for young children. Some of the suggestions on this thread are great. As an example, you can see how the stimtastic putty is presented as more 'adult' or purposeful than normal play clays - http://www.stimtastic.co/stim-toys/magnetic-thinking-putty The black, metal tin immediately makes it appear dignified and more of a 'tool' than something which comes in a bright yellow plastic tub with a cartoon animal on it.

Again, for some parents this doesn't matter - it depends on the family. But for some parents and young adults with disabilities, adult dignity is **very** important. Please be led by what sensory items/tools he owns already (which, from your brief description, do seem to have the appearance of not-for-children items).",7,,7,0,0,
