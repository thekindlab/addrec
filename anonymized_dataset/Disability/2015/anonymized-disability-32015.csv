f1119dcb-4c8e-46d0-a07f-79e368f58393,1425812460,"Before I became disabled, I was a teacher of advanced mathematics. Now I am mainly an advocate for severe mental illness. There are many difficulties that I have encountered doing this. To be honest, I worry that most of my attempts fail to achieve their essential purpose. Several of my submissions to Reddit have been removed, and I was also banned from posting to /r/mentalhealth [I do not know the reason for this, nor do I have any way to appeal it]. When a ""stranger"" is trying to protest or educate or share, this is often mis-construed as complaining, condescending, or self-promoting. Even though my disability is purely incidental to my argumentation, it is no secret that I do have a severe mental illness myself, and it is hard to achieve a positive rhetorical effect before a psychologizing audience. When being suggestive or satirical or hypothetical, one comes off as confrontational, spiteful, or inane.

For example, consider my suggestion of the following.

* Anti-depression - a mental illness characterized by a lack of unpleasant emotions.
* Anti-psychosis - a personality disorder characterized by the inability to interpret one's experiences objectively.

I think this is an interesting parody of psychiatric paradigms, which was part of a larger piece I wrote about the ethics of self-medication. Because it is one of my censored submissions, the discussion is lost- but I do recall the top comment.

I've learned to hide it very well (but I count myself lucky in that aspect), just to avoid the social stigmas you've ranted about...Its never going to get any easier I'm afraid to tell you. You have the right strategy already; basically don't tell anyone unless they bring it up, not so much because what their reaction would be ('cause I could care less), but because I'm tired of trying to justify my status in life to everyone. Neither should you. I've personally find it tiring and tedious to tell my reasons for being disabled. Explaining my various implants and emotional problems never changes their opinion positively or negatively anyway. Its just easier to avoid the topic altogether. That said, as other posters have already stated, you have nothing to be ashamed of or pitted for. Yeah, sure you can go the confident route and be proud of it.

|i feel as if the system is stacked against me...

yep, it is, can confirm. I don't know if it will help to tell you but, It has less to do with value assessments of society than it does with people's fragile egos...I've handled it by keeping mostly to myself, and living within my means, and making side cash as the opportunities arise. That is to say, I'm no longer out to impress anyone or live up to some standard/norm/image demands I should. I work with what I have, not with what I want. That said, Never confuse acceptance with approval. You can accept your situation but, know one says you have to like it. I don't like my situation either, but I've accepted there's not much I can do about it. Thus, If there's not much I can do about, what's the sense in complaining/worrying? (bit of Zen/Stocism there. Works for me anyway.)  

I'm completely with you on the possibility of losing my disability status if I return to work; believe you me, you're not the only one that feels/sees that 'catch 22' scenario.
Also, you can work part time and make up to $700 bucks a month on SSDI without loss of benefits and you have to report your income each month. You DO NOT need to go through Voc Rehab or WIPA. However, be aware, SSA DOES NOT always go by 'how much you make overall' as more to say; 'how many hours you CAN work.'  Look up the 'Red book' on SSA's website, then SGA (substantial gainful activity). It'll explain it better than I (and it still sucks).

Oh another bit of advice..NEVER, EVER, NEVER take the word of a SSA office worker at face value. Seriously, they're often wrong or misinformed themselves. I've experienced that one more than once, first hand. I've nearly gotten into serious trouble with my benefits because I took bad advice from a SSA caseworker. Its always better to ask an SS attorney on anything concerning your particular case and situation.

I had to share as I'm sure there are many folks that haven't heard the story of Andrea and Paul, especially outside of the UK. I remember seeing some stories about them when they first got married, they fought constantly and paved the way for others to follow their path. She was a beautiful bride and they were clearly in awe when they finally saw each other all dressed up. 

It should never have taken so long for them to get married though. They clearly loved each other deeply but they were treated like children for so long, even though they were independent adults. They both needed less care than I have but nobody questioned my right to marry my (able) husband!

I truly feel for Paul though, I cannot even begin to comprehend how he must be feeling. I don't think I could live without my husband, he's an amazing man. My heart goes out to Paul, he must be absolutely devastated, poor guy. ",7,0,7,0,0,

&gt;Kind of, but if you are only working 33 hours per month then you will probably still have part B coverage. 

I hopefully would be working enough to increase my income. I'm not actually sure how many hours I could handle working, but I wanted to see if working would actually increase my income. Many people on reddit write about actually having less income due to working.

&gt;What kind of transportation costs 20 dollars per day? Look into either bus transportation (can be paid by state VR), or some sort of Disability Rides program. 

Due to the nature of my disability, I wouldn't be able to take a shared rides program. So, hiring a PCA to drive me is better than a taxi. That being said, I have no job so these transportation numbers are simply a way to work through the math.

&gt;I take the bus and get half off due to medicare, which means I pay 2.50 each day.

&gt;I think the job you want combined with the transportation costs are the things holding you back.

Im not sure I understand. The job I want? Technically, there isn't a job, just running through easy numbers. That being said, most jobs I might be considered for pay $10 an hour.

So, if you are going to make over $780 then it is in your best interest to be in the ticket to work program. Why? Well, you can get certain levels of help from different agencies.

Instead of taking all the money they pay you a portion of it. (I got $400 a month) However, the scenario I was in involved going off SSDI for several years. If you use AAAtake charge during your TWP you will still get extra money during that 9 month period.

But more to the idea of the subject: I'm a fairly active person and I've managed to make most activities work so far.  When thinking about a secondary chair, certain limitations come to mind.  I start thinking of sports chairs with cambered out wheels.  Lightweight, but bigger.  Depending on the activity, this type of chair would be nice, but my head does come up with one immediate downfall.  For me, if I'm going to use a secondary chair, I don't want to have to bring two chairs with me to the activity.  When I leave my house I want just the one chair.  But the problem with this is that it limits you.  That chair is going to be wider and more restricting with things not related to its intended activity.  Take camping for example.  A chair that makes it easier to be on rougher terrain when I'm camping would be nice.  But it's a deal break if I decide I need to go into town and get a few things and I can't fit through the doors at the little gas station or general store because of the tires or build of the chair.  I do well enough in my primary chair where this type of situation would make me avoid dealing with the hassle of a secondary.

All you need really is proof of the expense, a quick justification for it (our WIPA will do this part for you (different state)) and maybe a Request for Reconsideration based on new evidence so SSA can re-open and look at those expenses and redetermine your countable earned income for SGA purposes. 

It's actually kind of crazy that a WIPA would've said this. Did you simply have someone tell you this?...or is it actually written into your BS&amp;A? If it's written into your BS&amp;A, please pm me a copy/details - would really like to see it.

3.   Brand new school built with the intention of housing all the gifted and special education students under one roof for the entire county.   The county put in a state of the art facility and an expensive playground.   What did they put on the playground for the ESE students needing physical accessibility?

It makes me angry that they were denied something as simple as the desire to marry for so long due to something so easily fixable (Doctor's were worried that a potential pregnancy could kill her due to the heart defect that eventually took her life anyway). 

She could have become pregnant whether she was married or not! Why deny them the happiness of being ""Mr &amp; Mrs"" because of something so stupid and easily resolved?

It worked out in the end as she had birth control injections and they were married for 10 years before Andrea sadly passed away due to her heart problems.

This shouldn't even be a news story though! It shows that we still have a long way to go in campaigning for the rights of disabled people, whether they're intellectually, physically or mentally disabled. 

RIP Andrea and thank you, and Paul, for fighting so hard and paving the way for others with intellectual disabilities to be allowed to live their lives as any other adult would.

Therapist then has us make an appointment with a DME (Durable Medical Equipment provider).   The DME then measures and evaluates needs based on an interview with us.  DME then contacts the pt who also provides input into what type of customization is needed.   The therapist then writes up a justification letter which is sent to the DME.   The DME also contacts the Rehab doctor who then writes a Rx for the wheelchair to be attached to the physical therapist letter and it is sent off to insurance where it takes around 6 months for paperwork to be processed.  

I know that sounds like a lot of work but most of this is done behind the scenes with the DME coordinating all the insurance and paperwork.   We also have two physical therapists and one rehab doctor on my son's medical team already so often appointments with them aren't necessary since they already have his medical file and can just churn out documentation once it is requested.

I cannot convey how important mobility is to creating a feeling of independence as well as a reduction in stress from worrying constantly about walking and falling and all those things. Combining the use of a mobility device with an increase in activities and social outings will go a long way towards getting over that resistance. Let's face it, she doesn't want to lose her independence which is why she's getting depressed yet if she doesn't use assistive devices and depends on you or others do do everything for her, she's contributing to her dependence and more depression. It's a vicious cycle.  As for work, wanting to work is great. Talk to your local vocational rehabilitation office ASAP. If she wasn't to keep her job or find another job, they can be helpful. You may want to talk to the social security office and apply for disability if the employment route seems futile. ",3,0,3,0,0,

First, $1 per page is ridiculous; especially if a lot of the stuff is electronically stored (so they just need to print). If they insist on that price try to stick to objective tests (xrays, pulmonary function studies, MRIs, etc. labs are NOT needed unless you have kidney or liver disease). 

Second, as more of a general for people who maybe considering applying. SSA will request (and pay for) records from your doctors for 1 year prior to when your alleged onset date (AOD) is through the current timeframe. You AOD is when you say you were disabled which for most people is the day they last worked (for SSI it is your filing date). So if you stopped work 1/1/14 I would request all medical 1/1/13 to Present). 

Now, that being said, we DO NOT go through extrodinary lengths to get the records. We send 2 requests (an initial and a follwo up a few weeks later). I will wait 30 days for the records. If I don't get them I will just move on without them. Only in about 1 in 25 cases will I make a phone call to a source, and that is only in rare circumstances where I think the person is an allowance and I cannot get the information anywhere else. There is nothing that I can do to make a doctor's office give me their records. We do not pre-pay, will will not pay over the state-set maximum, etc. 

So how can you help? When you apply for disability it is your responsiblity to make sure all the info you give me is accurate about your doctors. Especially the doctors FULL name, clinic name, correct address and corect phone number. If I can't find your doctor in our vendor file I will either not send the request or, what more often happens, it gets sent to the wrong place. The second thing that I suggest all applicants do is FOLLOW UP with both your DDS examiner and your doctor's office. Some states require will contact you via letter if your records aren't received but some others don't (I personally don't). So about 3 weeks or so after the DDS gets your case (I would say start that 3 week clock when you get those ADL/work history forms. we mail those the same day we mail records requests) call the DDS examiner to find out what they are still waiting on. If they are still waiting on records from Dr Smith, then you call and hound that office. Follow up again in 1 week. If Dr Smith still hasn't sent them. Then I would suggest going and getting them yourself and faxing or hand delivering those records to the DDS. Make sure to keep your DDS examiner updated; If I know that a claimant is making strides to get the records I will hold the case a little longer.

Sorry, man this got long. But what you all need to keep in mind is that we have very high caseloads (mine is usually around 140-170 active cases) and so we dont' have the time to track down your records from a non-responding doctor. That is just the fact. If you want to give your disability case the best chance then you need to make sure I have all the information. The more the better; I can easily weed through the stuff that isn't helpful to find the stuff that is. ",1,0,1,0,0,

On a more positive note is just say take into account your audience when posting stuff like this. Perhaps a better sub would be TIL something like that. 

Posting stuff like this and captioning it as ""A person's abilities are so much more than what meets the eye."" in this sub, is likely to alienate the audience, purely because we already know all that. We generally don't find  warm fuzzy stories about a pwd triumphing over adversity appealing, since that's just day to day life for a lot of us.

Your wife is extremely lucky to have you. I'd bet she knows that, and it's clear you love her. 

Are you looking after yourself? 

Would *you* benefit from counselling – a professional, confidental ear to hear how you're feeling about how things are progressing for and with your wife? If you're struggling a bit to see her decline, and finding it tough to support her through it, there's no shame in that. I think it can be probably pretty hard and draining to be there for a disabled peep and be their support 'pillar'.

I know one of the things I worry about most with my other half is that he's okay, and that he's looked after if things are particularly tough for me/us disability-wise. Partially this is because I love him and want him to be happy, supported and as well as possible; partially this is (and I know this is selfish) because I am aware that people can only take so much, and if he suddenly can't cope anymore I'd lose that lifeline of support.

So... it's important to look after yourself, too. I'd recommend sitting down on your own and figuring out what you can put in place to help yourself. Maybe counselling/therapy, maybe a more informal support network (I'm pretty sure you could find plenty of groups for partners-of-disabled-folks), or are your friends great at being there for you? Do you get yourself treats occasionally to bolster spirits? That kind of thing. Basically anything that might benefit your wife, also applying to your own life individually.

Okay, thank you.

2) If you make over $780 you are now in the trial work period, for 9 months you can make as much money as you want even above the SGA! It won't hurt your SSDI checks.

Theoretically, you could make 10,000 one month and be fine?

&gt;
3) If you make above $1090 if you have no twp left your SSDI will be cutoff and you may be responsible for overpayments that must be payed back. Never ever get an over payment. Take that from someone who has had them.

If you don't mind, could you share more about how this happened and how the aftermath played out?

&gt;
4) You're supposed to report to SSDI any income that you receive, even under $780. The only other way they find out is from the IRS by doing database checks. They've found income I didn't report that way. Generally there's a two year lag-time for them to find it.

How do you report it?

&gt;
5) Yes, I was completely off SSDI for several years. To get back on I was able to do the social security expedited reinstatement. You have 5 years after losing SSDI to start the expedited process. It's basically like reapplying, but is much faster and according to a lady I spoke to at the SS office, almost always is approved. Unless you really did have an improvement in your condition. (Mine gets worse) 

This is part of what I'm concerned about. I just worry about the political climate and if policies or funding changes, it could be denied, even if it's legitimate.

&gt;6) If I did it again would I? I don't know. I did have a job with overtime that payed me $300-$600 above my SSDI. Then I got $400 from the ticket to work. So, in that sense it was good. I didn't have a TWP - due to using it by accident in 2002 on a lousy job that paid too much. I had no idea. I think it was good and bad. At the end, it was bad only because I was making not much more than what I would off SSDI. In fact, now with several raises I'm actually better off on SSDI than with the job. So, it's up to you and why you're doing it really.

Yes, for some people, speaking would be their only and preferred method of communicating... and that's ok!

But what's not ok is acting as if the deaf people, nonverbal, and whoever would've ended up preferring a visual / tactile language over aural language for *any* reason (remember, ASL classes has taken off like a wild fire in the past decades, showing that there is interest in visual languages outside of signing people communities) should just sit on their hands and accept things as it is. 

The deaf community is presenting a vision of what the future could look like... A more egalitarian world where everybody has access to aural, visual, and tactile languages, regardless of their body. And if everybody is learning a sign language, they will then learn about deaf culture, their and disabled history, and the forces behind their dark age. Unlike learning another major Western language, learning a sign language (in Western Civilization, at least) means that people will be forced to see a *counter-narrative* of what has been going on under their nose in their region, all of those years. And the narrative isn't always a happy one.

Sometimes, a bit of opening is all needed to inject the idea that something is amiss... And then use that moment to create a change for a more egalitarian world. ",1,0,1,0,0,

7e36148b-2b74-4bba-b469-eb50434fa64b,1426165399,"Hi :) 
 Have these issues and have found that being very aware of my diet and exercise is quite helpful. I use a large exercise ball to do seated exercises that mimic standing. I see a PT whenever I need a modification to my routine or experience progression. 
This helps with core strength and general motility/circulation/improvement of some spasticity. 
I eat many small meals as opposed to any large ones. I smoke marihuana for muscle spasms and nausea/vomitting. I cut back on my buprenorphine for a couple of days if I am noticing I have missed a day or four of using the bathroom. I have found that the quantity of buprenorphine I consume impacts my impaction;) 

Edit: sorry my thumb twitched as it does, and sent my message b4 I as through. So continued: 
If I notice I have gone a couple days with no urge to use the bathroom or unsuccessful attempts, I take a mild dose of ducolax (over the counter). I do this only about once per month, as management of diet and awareness has been pretty much enough. I do drink some gallon to two gallons of water per day which is pretty nuts, but I'm putting a ton of medication in my system and I love a good ice water :)

I agree with the posters who say see a gastroenterologist. Some people who experience poor motility need more fiber, others need less. Some need more movement in some parts of the intestine and less movement/spasticity in others.
In the meantime, limit bread, pasta, dehydrated snacks, and so t eat too many seeds like from pomegranates and strawberries. I find that eating a ton of baby arugula, Kimchi (which had probiotics and I am not obsessed with yogurt), fruit and veggie smoothies with no dairy (I use coconut or cashew milk because the are creamier than lame almond milk or boring soy) are gray staples for me.  Mangoes, avocados, kiwis and bananas are better on my GI than pomegranates or strawberries because if you are going to get impacted, you really don't want to deal with feeling like you are bringing a baby porcupine into the world. And you thought you were being gross?? :) 
Again, this is just some of what has worked for me. Be patient with yourself and aim for a little improvement at a time. See a specialist, eliminate as much stress from your life as possible, and keep your docs informed of what the others are doing.. And you should be well on your way to a much happier stomach. 
P.p.s. I have had all sorts of prescription anti-emetics and others  for the vomiting/spasticity component. In my case, medical marijauna has been effective where onedestron and promethazine have not. So ya, get to the root of the issue and then work outwards :)

[Rant warning]

Over a decade ago I lost most of the use of one leg due malpractice (a doctor ignored clear signs until it spiraled out of control). I spent time in the hospital, and months on very strong drugs and painkillers.  The leg is permanently damaged and I've been told that it may simply stop functioning completely, or get so much worse that it will have to be removed.  With exercise I've managed to keep it at a status quo, for now. It's not getting better, but it's not worse.

However, the catch is -- I'm fat.  My current doctor doesn't have access to the past hospital records (short version: all the records were destroyed) and does not listen when I talk about my issues with my leg. All she can see or hear is that I am disabled because of my weight.  While my weight is an issue, it is not the cause of my disability nor does it affect the disability. (It's kind of like saying that losing weight will stop Alzheimer's. Weight affects some things, but not everything.)

I can't get through to her. I'm at a loss.  The thing is, if you look at the leg right now it mostly looks normal.  I'm utterly terrified that I'm going to again wind up in the hospital, deathly ill and/or losing the leg, listening again to a doctor say, ""Gee, I guess you were right after all.""",2,0,2,0,0,

From when I was 6 to when I was 8, he also took medication that had a side effect that made him really sensitive to sound. Yeah, bad combination to have an already irritable person living with 2 kids, right? Well, my dad wasn't perfect. He occasionally sent my brother and me to our rooms for arbitrary reasons, and he occasionally used a heightened tone with us, but he never did anything that would lead me to believe he ever resented me. He also often ended his slight curtness by telling my brother and me that he knows we didn't do anything bad to him, that he made a mistake, and that he loves us.

In terms of frustration that reduced mobility would bring, he was on his way climbing up the corporate ladder, planning on being the CEO of his company within ten years when he was diagnosed. My mom went back to work and he became the stay-at-home dad who had to time his medicine right so he could take my brother and me to school. He said that at first he was sad and felt inadequate for being pulled out of the corporate world, but then he started calling himself Mr. Mom as his new ""corporate"" title and he said being a stay-at-home dad was a blessing, because it allowed him to spend more time with his kids. I can tell that he sometimes wishes he could go back to the corporate world, but it's not so bad that he should be excused for being mean and bitter toward his family.

My mom has stayed by my dad's side, even though his fat paychecks my dad used to receive was part of the reason my parents wanted to be together in the first place. 

As for my aforementioned ex-boyfriend, he behaved a lot like you said your husband does. He didn't want to improve his health or his attitude. He just sat around all day and used his poor health as an excuse to be mean to me. I made him go to counseling, but he dropped out after a month because it didn't fix all of his problems.

f1251df5-9a11-443d-9884-8ac29def5007,1426110617,"That was a really good and thorough article! I must say a lot of things sounded familiar to my situation, while others did not so much. It was a really good read and I would like to give my own perspective about disability, sex and overall images of the disabled or otherwise impaired. 

&amp;nbsp;

I like how the article focuses on the overall problem of a certain image pressing on people, in this case sexuality of disabled people. There are other problems too in the world, like the combination of work and disabled people, but that is for another time. As a male disabled person in Europe I too sense the (rather ignorant) view that disabled people can't or don't want to have sex. And then there is the offensive view that one shouldn't want to have sex with a disabled person, or that the sexual encounter ""does not count"" because impaired people are seen as desperate in this case. 

&amp;nbsp;

I think this is something each disabled person (I really need to find another word for variety's sake) encounters in his/her life, perhaps in different gradations because of different cultures. Even though in the article the Netherlands is mentioned for advocating the so called sex surrogates, its overall culture and the people living here do not impress me to be open to the idea of disabled people having sex, at least not in my case. Even more so, it SEEMS TO ME it is less of a problem in say, the United States, but that's only through stories on the internet. Over here it also seems that impaired women have it easier in dating than impaired men, although I have no explanation why. 

&amp;nbsp;

Paid sex is mentioned in the article as a special service for disabled people. I have no experience with this, but as far as I know the prices of these services are rather high. I always wonder how a ""regular"" prostitute would react if a wheelchair bound person entered the brothel. Would they be denied for the ""regular"" service? 

&amp;nbsp;

Sometimes sex is described as a right, just like in this article. I always have doubts with this motto, but I'm not a complete opponent either. Sex is (generally speaking) two people coming together to pleasure each other, which means both parties need to consent. You cannot force another person to have sex with you. The aforementioned sex surrogates also provide only a short term solution for a long term problem in my opinion, given its price and general staleness with its level of professionalism. As far as I can tell, however, most people DO have sex. And if they are not having a sex partner right now, they most likely will in the near future. Of course some people do get more than others, but overall speaking there are plenty of people for pleasure. With us disabled people, it sometimes feels like we are outside of that pool, not selectable for having sex no matter how we try or improve. 

&amp;nbsp;

One thing I miss in the article is impaired people having sex with each other. Sometimes it may not be practical. But especially when both parties are ""equally disabled"", they might understand each other on a whole new level. Please don't neglect that possibility. 

&amp;nbsp;

Overall, we have long ways to go with our disability and sex lives in most cases, but it is improving if only slightly. One thing is most important however. You are just a human being like anyone else, with phsyical urges, like anyone else. Despite what others might tell you, it is normal, okay and perhaps even important to pursue your sexual needs.

So if you have one eye that is blind that is not an issue. You're vision has to be worse than 20/200 (corrected) in your best eye.

This is almost always the case, there are a few exceptions. I am not sure about OP's background but the following ruling from SSR 85-15 could fit him:

&gt;As a general rule, even if a person's visual impairment(s) were to eliminate all jobs that involve very good vision (such as working with small objects or reading small print), as long as he or she retains sufficient visual acuity to be able to handle and work with rather large objects (and has the visual fields to avoid ordinary hazards in a workplace), there would be a substantial number of jobs remaining across all exertional levels. However, a finding of disability could be appropriate in the relatively few instances in which the claimant's vocational profile is extremely adverse, e.g., closely approaching retirement age, limited education or less, unskilled or no transferable skills, and essentially a lifetime commitment to a field of work in which good vision is essential.

Essentially, if you're over the age of 55 with less than high school education, you may have a chance.

3) If you make above $1090 if you have no twp left your SSDI will be cutoff and you may be responsible for overpayments that must be payed back. Never ever get an over payment. Take that from someone who has had them.


4) You're supposed to report to SSDI any income that you receive, even under $780. The only other way they find out is from the IRS by doing database checks. They've found income I didn't report that way. Generally there's a two year lag-time for them to find it.


5) Yes, I was completely off SSDI for several years. To get back on I was able to do the social security expedited reinstatement. You have 5 years after losing SSDI to start the expedited process. It's basically like reapplying, but is much faster and according to a lady I spoke to at the SS office, almost always is approved. Unless you really did have an improvement in your condition.

These problems are only amplified if you're in a wheelchair.  I live in a fairly small city and the most popular venue for smaller bands (the type I happen to like) is this tiny ass place up above a bar with two flights of stairs.  If it wasn't for being in a wheelchair I would be going to multiple shows a month.  But because of the chair I think I've been to 5 shows in like 7 or 8 years.  The place has no elevator and the tiny bathrooms upstairs are less than accommodating.  But if I love the band I'll be damned if I'll let the inaccessibility stop me from going.

It's especially hard on people who are used to being strong and independent (don't like to ask for or need help).

When you get to the point where you are suspecting you may not be able to work anymore (meaning it may be time for SSDI), that's one of the hardest parts, especially if it's a job you really like and/or are really good at or make a lot of money at. It's really hard to admit to yourself that things have gotten so bad that you can't work anymore. From your story, I have a feeling your wife is starting to realize that soon she won't be able to work and will have to apply for benefits, and this may be what is ramping up the depression. I went through the same thing, and it was incredibly difficult.

You may want to look around your city (or even online) for disability or chronic pain support groups. She'll be able to commiserate with people in similar situations, and they usually meet in the evening, so she won't have to miss work for them.

As far as you go, you seem to be doing great in supporting her and being there for her, so just keep doing that. She'll be more grateful for it than you can possibly know.

As to your finances, they are no one else's business. Maybe you have a trust fund or inheritance or maybe you partake in some shady practices. There are a lot of options, and all of them are private and personal. If it is someone you are not close to, you can say ""that's an inappropriate question"" or ""that's a bit personal."" For people who you are closer to, you can say ""it is not something that I like to discuss"" or ""maybe I'll tell you about it one day."" If someone expresses surprise about your apartment or car, you can say ""don't worry, I live within my means.""
    
I, too, do not like telling people about my disability. People don't take it seriously or I just rather them not know. It is not really their business and I don't want them to view me differently because of it. Even if there are people who you are comfortable telling about your disability, that does not mean that you have to tell them that you are on SSDI. Share only what you are comfortable sharing and brush off questions you do not want to answer.

When you're disabled, there are aspects of your care you find frustrating. When I was younger and I was cared for by my mum, I used to find the way she did certain things incredibly frustrating. Sometimes, I needed things done straight away but because my mum had other responsibilities (like looking after my brother or housework or her job), I had to wait or I had to accept things weren't going to get done how I wanted. This led to a cycle of anger and frustration between my mum and me and we both talked to each other in ways we didn't mean during the process of care and then went straight back to having a great relationship during the moments she wasn't caring for me. This kind of thing becomes quite deeply embedded after a while and eventually you stop realizing you're even doing it because you've managed to separate your relationship into a care component and a regular component and forgotten that the person who is caring for you doesn't necessarily have that same perception of things. 

Furthermore, even if your husband doesn't necessarily know it, he is likely to be feeling guilty. Guilt is an enormous and unspoken about aspect of disability, especially when people you care about are doing the caring for you. I felt guilty when my mum had to focus on me instead of my brother or when I saw how tired she was day after day. This just made me more frustrated. In fact, I can say I became more aggressive at times because I wanted to push my mum away so that I didn't have to face the guilt I felt. 

I don't know if any of that makes sense. It doesn't excuse the behaviour but it might be behind some of what is going on. If you are able to, I would strongly strongly advise you discuss getting an outside carer so that you can both be on equal ground. Nothing infuriates me more than feeling like I am at the mercy of someone elses good will and I'm willing to bet there's an element of that in your husband.",10,0,10,0,0,

You can use the benefits calculator on the CAB site to see what you're entitled to and then find your local office and arrange to see an advisor who can help you with the forms.

If your local CAB is too busy to see your right now then see if you have a ""DIAL"" (Disability Information Advice Line) office in your area instead. They're a charity that was set up specifically to help disabled people with this kind of thing.

They not only help with benefits but they can offer you advice and support with regards to almost all aspects of being disabled. It's run by volunteers and almost all the people working there either have a disability themself or care for somebody with a disability. It means that they really understand what it's like to deal with all the problems a disability can throw at you.

Right now, I'm fighting to get through life, let alone my last year of school (which is especially difficult because of poverty and lack of accommodation). So I'm pretty much with you on this.

For myself, I used to try to hide it, and would go to great lengths to do so. Now, I'm more confident in my identity (though I still struggle), and it's not really an easy thing to hide anyway. So I'm pretty open about everything, because in my eyes, there's nothing wrong with being disabled, and it's nothing I should be ashamed of. In fact, I now take pride in being a disabled woman (thanks, social model).

&gt;  i feel as if the system is stacked against me.

That's because it definitely is.

&gt; the fact is no one sees my disability as being severe enough to warrant not working, and they resent or doubt me for it, when the truth is i wanna try working, but doing so would endanger my safety net...

Yeah, seriously. Fuck those who think they can decide how severe anyone's disability is and who ""deserves"" accommodation. We have a terrible enough time as it is, and integration into the workplace is disincentivized.

&gt;  this sub seems to be more focused on people with physical disabilities, and i don't wanna take anything away from their plight. but the truth is just because you don't see me in a wheel chair or spastic muscles does not mean i'm a fully functional member of society. at least not today.

Yeah, this is an issue in the disability community at large. I won't go into too much detail as to why I think that is, but it's partially because of this notion (conscious or not) that mentally disabled individuals don't struggle that much, or that they somehow deserve their plight because other disabled individuals can't help it, but mental can (obviously false).

And there's also this stigma associated with disability. Disabled people aren't considered whole, so by using the term ""mental illness,"" people internalize ableism, and try to use a term which reflects that they aren't missing something, but that they're merely ill. In the end, these distinctions are bad for all of us, and we need to stop playing against each other in order to appear like we have higher value. The entire measurement of value is based on our capitalist society anyway.

She may be right about her employer. As I became more disabled my supervisor pushed harder and harder to create situations where I would fail so he could fire me.   As I was depressed about things (and struggling to deal with my illnesses and growing disability) I made one huge mistake - I did not document what was going on.  Document everything. Help her do it.  Document what time she took off and why. Document any change to her job that they make.  Document any comment about her performance they make.    My then-supervisor made some statements that are arguably illegal (like telling me that he had to change my duties [which is legal] because ""you might wind up back in the hospital any day now and I can't depend on you"" [which is illegal - you cannot base an employee's performance based on a health-related 'might-happen']).  If I'd properly documented I could have sued.

I also didn't want to give up working.  When I lost that job my doctor all but begged me to file for SSDI but I refused, insisting I could still work. I got another job... only to be fired for ""being more disabled than you lead us to believe in the interviews"" (which wasn't the formal reason, and only said behind closed doors, so they could deny it was ever said).   

SSDI is not the end of the universe.  First, it's something you pay into - it's meant as a safety net for those who become too disabled to *do their current job*.  It's not supposed to mean ""I give up,"" it's realizing that your life has changed.  Second, it doesn't have to mean the end of working completely.  I cannot work in my former field anymore but didn't completely stop. I volunteered for the first 3 years and now work part-time, completely online. 

Lastly, about mobility devices -- I get this one. I fought tooth and nail having to use a cane, but had to give in because I kept falling over.   Now that I can barely walk I had to give in and get a mobility scooter. I am still not comfortable using it, but it does give me the freedom to do things I cannot do otherwise, like get around at a farmer's market or go to a fair.   I keep trying to walk. The pain gets insane. Then I stop leaving the house because it hurts to walk.  A part of me recognizes this is a stupid and vicious cycle, and the depression aggravates that.  But there's a part that realizes that with the scooter I can do things just like everyone else.

As for the counseling et al.  If she doesn't want to take time off of work, look into counselors or therapists that work off hours. Some even work remotely (ie. do sessions over things like Skype).  There's a big database at psychologytoday.com that's searchable.   Other options include finding online support groups, mailing lists, or chat rooms.

I've also looked into UIC, and haven't ruled it out completely, but like I said before, I think I might want to go through another field, and focus on DS instead. I figure that if I study DS specifically, then I might be pigeon-holed a little bit. I would love to go into a career with academia, and I worry that if I study DS, then my only possible career would be in teaching DS (which is not available at many schools). But if I study another discipline and focus in DS, then I will not only have better job opportunities, but I'll also have more of a chance at spreading DS as a legitimate and valuable thing to study.

But yeah. I'm actually most interested in mental, followed by physical and cognitive. (My diagnoses are OCD, depression, and anxiety.) I'm intrigued by political psychiatry, and how it's used to silence people, but also how it's used as an example of bad psychiatry, while other diagnoses are perceived to be legitimate. Particularly when a class analysis is added, you can see how disability (and not just mental) is based on capitalist modes of production, and I want to explore the relationships between disability discrimination and other methods of oppression. Our very language perpetuates ideals of how bodies ""should"" be, so I'm especially interested in how linguistic factors influence our definitions and perceptions.

That's kind of a lot, I know, but I guess I still have time to try to narrow my focus down. I'm planning to spend at least a year working, so I can save up my resources and get stabilized before I start grad school (poverty and disability don't mix well).

&gt;It's actually kind of crazy that a WIPA would've said this. Did you simply have someone tell you this?...or is it actually written into your BS&amp;A? If it's written into your BS&amp;A, please pm me a copy/details - would really like to see it. 

I called and spoke anonymously but very specifically with someone there - he seemed very knowledgeable, i say that with limited knowledge. So, I gave him the financial breakdown of state and federal benefits and then asked questions as a way to walk through my different options. (For example, if I work, the income may be deducted from fed benefits, but not state benefits, in which case I may end up breaking even or even lose money.)

I think it was good and bad. At the end, it was bad only because I was making not much more than what I would off SSDI.

This has been with learning disabilities, senior care and physical and sensory disabilities. 

Anger is part of bereavement. (for the loss of a lifestyle) it is a secondary emotion to fear.
Fear of how life will be, fear of how bad it could get, fear of the  burden it places on people .

Grief for what used to be. 

There are four key stages in bereavement of any sort. 

Anger
Denial

027a1edc-29da-4b66-aaf2-22f18a400f4e,1425449416,"A couple of times.

The first was outpatient. This particular therapist was a no-nonsense, no-mercy sort -- *and there's a place for that*. It's usually rather effective. What she didn't seem to understand was that what I described as 'Pain the doctors can't quite diagnose yet' really, actually wasn't 'pain that I just think I have.' It was complex mechanical problems in my knee, stemming from poor alignment, traumatic injury, and a long series of surgeries that only seemed to make it all worse. Ultimately that problem led to the amputation flair you see now; but at the time, it was a nebulous, confusing thing, and this therapist had no time for it. I admire that in a lot of people, but not in her. I've gone through basic training, graduated the Air Force Academy in 2009 and all the physical rigors that come with that; graduated flight school, graduated SERE (a survival and captive-resistance training program where the instructors *literally* beat you, and worse). I was in Special Operations. I don't say this to brag, I say this to emphasize the following point -- *this woman hurt me worse than any trainer I ever had, in any school, in any way, ever.* And she didn't give a hoot. While I channeled screams of pain into a pure bloodthirsty rage as I struggled in a hydrotherapy pool, she would stand on the side throwing insults and making a show of writing down her unfavorable checkmarks. Look -- *I love that kind of thing*. That's a thing because it usually motivates results that will surprise even the trainee. It works, basically, unless you're doing it wrong, and *oh my god she was doing it so wrong*. But I wanted to get better, so I took it, and I took it, and then I took it some more, right up until it broke me even harder than I was already. After about three weeks she had a talk with her overlords and they cut me from therapy, since I was clearly allowing myself to regress and I must not have the strength of character it takes to make circles with my foot (lol). Bitch, I've touched the *sky* and looked down on the birth of tropical storms in the Gulf. When **I** can't do something, it's serious. She didn't deserve me anyway.

The second (and last) was inpatient therapy, after the fourth surgery trying to fix the knee (the following surgery would *remove* the knee). Obviously, if you know where it ended up, you know that this, too, was a doomed endeavor. I don't mind the failure -- it was out of her hands, Mother Theresa couldn't have cured me. But Mother Theresa might have paid attention. This therapist (also a lady -- I'm sorry, my bad experiences are a bit sexist, you'll have to forgive me) was pretty well respected in a *very* well-thought-of facility in Texas. People came from far and wide to get better here -- most of them much older, or in much worse shape, than I was at the time. When I was admitted, the rap sheet simply read that I was recovering from arthroscopic knee surgery -- an easy case, then! And he's *young*, too, you'll have no trouble here. I started out with a guy who was only at the facility temporarily -- I guess people do that, move around building up a resume as temps, and collecting gigantic paychecks. Anyway he got me started and it was going okay -- we built up a pretty good range of motion, we found where the hard limit was (about 105 degrees -- there was **no** getting around 105 degrees). With that limit in place, we started working on strength, endurance, balance, etc. in smart ways that made sense, and I made a lot of progress. *Then she happened*. She took over after about two and a half weeks, and immediately things were different. I came in with a wheelchair, which I'd been using exclusively for the better part of a year. She stole it. Then she stole one of my crutches, too, because ""Arthroscopic means you only need one."" I'm sure she read it in a book, probably a book about some other guy who hadn't been bedridden for over a year in indescribable pain. ""Oh, pain? Here, eat more drugs, I'll get you more drugs, now walk."" Now look, I would've been upset if all she did was wipe out all the progress I made. She did that. I fell from 105 degrees to 90, then back under 90. I would've been angry if she did all that *and* force-fed me narcotics. But that wasn't all. She would drag me halfway up a flight of concrete steps and let go, to go read paperwork with her lackey-in-training. She would leave me stranded on the wrong end of the facility with no way to get back to my bed but one leg and a single crutch. It only took a few days of these antics before I'd torn a new hole in my rotator cuff -- thanks, now in addition to a shit leg I have a shit arm, fantastic work! You'd think that would sort of, you know, catch a person's attention, but no. ""I'll get some more drugs, big day today."" Man, I hated her. Again, being an idiot, I stuck with it, thinking if I push hard enough things will just, you know, work somehow (spoiler: they didn't), but even my stupid patience had its limits. Next time she had me on the stairs, she ran off to impart her copious wisdom to the lackey kid, and I fell off. Fortunately, it was near the bottom, and I caught the railing so that I didn't catch too much damage. I shit you not, she turned around for like a *second*, saw me dangling there, and went back to what she was doing. So I let out a nice, loud, ""FUCK THIS."" My busted crutch arm carried me all the way to the administrative desk, where I let anybody within earshot know exactly what I thought of my therapist, and told them where they could find me when they came up with a new one. I suspect I hurt her feelings. Good. She hurt my goddamn *everything*. But, inpatient facilities being what they are, I didn't manage to avoid her completely -- she kept showing up in the gym, or in group sessions, with that cowed look of someone whose performance report might impact her salary. Fuck her. Once -- again, you're gonna think I'm stretching the truth here, I'm not -- she caught me in a group session, *grabbed my ass*, and tried to force in an explanation of how hard it was to be her. I'm not sure if I hit her or if that was just in my head, probably the latter, but she got the message. The following week I swore up and down that I felt all better and that I was totally ready to go back home and go to work. I wasn't -- but I was totally ready to get the hell away from that woman. They let me out and I'm not going back. 

The lesson I learned -- and it's a good one -- is that it's *so easy* to get rid of these people. You *don't* have to suffer through them -- they're not you, they don't know better than you, and if they think they're better than you, they're wrong. Fire them. **Fire them!** You can, and you should, and you won't regret it. And you might just save yourself a busted shoulder. That's why the second is also the last -- because there will not be a third therapist who treats me that way. I know better now. Just to spite the lot of them, I'm currently kicking ass with one leg and a new therapist who can't believe anybody could ever recover from an amputation so quickly. See that, dragon ladies? **It was all your fault, not mine. You're terrible at your jobs and you should be sacked.** I'll show up to your going-away party with a bottle of champagne and wave goodbye with a grin. I'm indomitable -- you almost beat me, but I won in the end.",4,0,4,0,0,

As you've seen, there are people here with mental illness disabilities, as well as people with both physical and mental disabilities.  However, there are also Reddit subs just for mental illnesses (see the ""Related Subs"" in the side bar).

I have had issues since I was about 10, which was back when dinosaurs roamed the Earth.  It's been a struggle, in part because I've had 1001 diagnoses (or so it has seemed) and never properly been treated.  Mental illness is not the primary reason I'm on disability but it's in the mix.

You don't say where you are, but depending on what kind of disability you are getting you may be able to work part time.   There are restrictions but it's doable.

If you're taking University or College classes your school probably has an office of accessibility.  Try contacting them for help.  If they don't know what to do, they should know who to turn to.

In general, there's still a belief amongst too many that mental illnesses are either all-or-nothing: either you're a stereotypical ""raving lunatic"" who should be locked up or you're lazy and/or faking it.   Many people don't understand how common mood disorders and anxiety are and those who aren't affected by them don't seem to understand how devistating they can be.

65eb3d01-3c5f-4f46-bbd9-7f98ef92e763,1425646924,"Ok. I'll try to take your questions as chunks. First, apply for both SSD and SSI (they typically have you apply for both) to see which you actually qualify for. 

You're right that they are going to look at the fact that you haven't taken your medications for very long and say ""well he could get better."" In order to be found disabled you have to have the condition at a severity to prevent employment for a continuous 12 months *despite* treatment. So likely the denial you will get will read something like ""although your condition is severe and is currently preventing you from working it is not expected to preclude work activity for 12 months."" Because 75% of people do see a significant improvement with medication, which means that likely you will see improvement although it can take a while for meds to be adjusted. 

You are also correct that sometimes not taking medications (or noncompliance with treatment in general) is considered a symptom of mental illness and is ""excused"" a bit in the disability world. However, this is only generally the case with very severe disorders such as schizophrenia and some organic brain disorders (TBIs, etc). I've never successfully seen that argument for anxiety and depressive disorders. 

Honest talk, a lot of people aren't the greatest with taking their meds and being compliant with follow ups and treatment. And you can be sure to explain that when you apply for disability. But you are young and it doesn't sound like you have much of a treatment history (2 years from what I can tell). You're best bet is to really stick with treatment. Try different medications and therapies and stick with them. 

In the long run you likely will only qualify for SSI which is only about $700 per month max. That is never going to be enough to live on. Disability should never be the first thing that people look for. It is incredibly difficult to get when you are young and you don't have much a of a treatment history (and i'm not directing this soley at you; I see questions like yours frequently in this sub).

So if a deaf individual needed to communicate with a random blind person on the street, they wouldn't just know tactile signing because they know ASL.  Also, this would be yet another thing where the education system would have to spend money hiring specialized teachers for the blind, instead of teaching them to read ASL just like everyone else in the class.  In short, implementing this would be a win for the rights and quality of life of the deaf, and a detrimental loss of rights and quality of life for the blind.

What you have to do now is provide them with medical documentation that shows evidence that you could NOT work with proper training. Are they referring to job training or occupational therapy? If OT, try it out and provide the paperwork explaining why it did or did not work. 
Basically, take any information they have given you about the denial and determine if it is accurate or not. If accurate, ask for help getting this training and working. If not accurate, find examples in your medical history of why not. 
If you cannot maintain focus throughout the day or while on a task etc etc, find good examples. 
Also i would recommend asking your doctor/s for letters explaining their position on whether or not you can work and if not, why. This helps tons. I brought a letter from my main doctor as well as one from each of the two therapists i had had over the past few years. I also wrote out my own testimony so that the judge could reference it visually.

&gt; 3) If you make above $1090 if you have no twp left your SSDI will be cutoff and you may be responsible for overpayments that must be payed back. Never ever get an over payment. Take that from someone who has had them.
&gt; If you don't mind, could you share more about how this happened and how the aftermath played out?


&gt; 4) You're supposed to report to SSDI any income that you receive, even under $780. The only other way they find out is from the IRS by doing database checks. They've found income I didn't report that way. Generally there's a two year lag-time for them to find it.

&gt; How do you report it?


&gt; 5) Yes, I was completely off SSDI for several years. To get back on I was able to do the social security expedited reinstatement. You have 5 years after losing SSDI to start the expedited process. It's basically like reapplying, but is much faster and according to a lady I spoke to at the SS office, almost always is approved. Unless you really did have an improvement in your condition. (Mine gets worse)

&gt; This is part of what I'm concerned about. I just worry about the political climate and if policies or funding changes, it could be denied, even if it's legitimate.



Yes, you can make a million in a those 9 months if you want. :-D

Got overpayments? I got bad information from a SS worker. That never happens right? (rolls eyes) I now get EVERYTHING from SS in writing. Many many times they have given me wrong information that ended up screwing me over. So, they took money out of my irs return to pay it back. 

You report earnings by calling them or going to an office. I actually don't even bother reporting stuff unless it is near the max allowed. No point really for me.

It's a depressing phase when we are adjusting to a chronic and progressive condition, but it IS possible to get through it.

This can help her compartmentalize the negative stuff.

When first becoming increasingly disabled, you are still constantly thinking of things you can no longer do and dwelling on that. It takes some time to discover there are gifts that come along with being forced to change your lifestyle. You have to slow down and readdress what you really want out of life within new parameters and it can lead to a time of great insight and self-improvement. For example, I can't train horses now, but have this awesome chance to explore art and writing in between hot baths and improving my cooking. Small but fulfilling activities are no longer taken for granted. 

I would highly recommend 'Managing Pain Before if Manages You' by dr Margaret Caudill and 'The Pain Chronicles' by Melanie Thernstrom. The first is a proven effective workbook and the second is a well-written and relatable journalist piece. If you could both read them, it can better help you relate to what your wife is going through.

Also perhaps you might find other (better) ideas in IBD communities? We know our shit. Heh.",1,0,1,0,0,

my family has run into people like that a lot, people leaving notes on the car of my parents and saying all kinds of nasty things when they don't even realize that they are fine and i'm the one with the disability. try not to let those people with a nasty nature by heart stop you from getting something that will truly help you out.",2,0,2,0,0,

As someone with no musical talent what-so-ever, this made my school experiences way less fun than they needed to be, thanks to all of the well-intentioned people who had my musical career all mapped out for me.  Kind of related to the dog-like hearing thing, but much more irritating, especially because it's based in truth.  The percentage of blind people with perfect pitch, or who are extremely musical, is vastly higher than it is in the regular population.  But people can't get the difference between ""many are"" and ""all are"" through there heads.  ",6,0,6,0,0,

It's from a thing I was working on last year for my union, they're from the Conference Board of Canada ([here](http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/details/society/disabled.income.aspx))(or not, I just checked the link and the website has changed from the last time I used it. Wheee. Please trust me that they came from there). So they're not exactly what we're looking at but I don't have time right now to do more research, but they can give you a bit of a rough idea of how things progress.

EDIT: These numbers are for overall percentages of PWD, not people with specifically acquired or congenital.

15.5%       Overall

10%  	15 – 64

4.7% 	15 – 24

8%	        25 – 44

18.3%	45 – 64

+50%       75+


There weren't any numbers for the 64 - 75 year olds, but the report I was working on was more about employment, so they were mostly focusing on the 15 - 64 year olds I think those numbers would be interesting though because that's where the jump from 18% to +50% starts to happen.

Basically these were the least depressing figures I learned while working on it, everything else was just... not good.",2,0,2,0,0,
