Keep the chair weight accessible, for my son we wrote it on a label and stuck it on the back of his wheelchair.   After that any time they weight you on the wheelchair scale all you have to do is tell them the exact weight of your wheelchair and they can then subtract it out to get your weight.   

I suppose if you have a base model with no custom seating options or custom wheels etc. you could use the manufacturer's weight but if you have any supports or customization at all it is going to throw the accuracy of your weight off.

I talked to one of our product specialists and while it's not a super common adaptation i.e. getting a stroller into the trunk, we've done one or two of them. He suggested using a wheelchair hoist or crane. They come in all shapes and sizes with different functions such as telescopic and folding arms. Some of them are static and fit in larger vehicles while others can be folded down or taken apart in between uses to fit in smaller trunks. I'd say that except for hand controls, wheelchair hoists are perhaps the most wide spread solution among manufacturers, so finding one shouldn't be a problem regardless of what car you drive.

I'm sure I'm in the minority on this as I haven't seen others with this, but for myself my biggest issue is not being able to easily fit my frame through the driver's seat entrance. A bunch of paras I know have sedans or other small cars where they can disassemble and lift the chair after transferring into the driver's seat. They don't use adapted vehicles mainly for cost efficiency, although part of it is car preference and not wanting to rely on a ramp to be able to get in/out.

Whenever someone applies for disability they are automatically applying for both SSI and SSDI.

589f63c3-bad5-4542-ac39-e0e5a5dc6591,1450324073,"Social Security disability is a federal program. It typically doesn't matter from state to state when you apply. What state you're in only matters when (if) you appeal.  That's mostly because of the wait times due to how much of a case load exists.

SSDI vs SSI (both are run by Social Security Administration) are two different programs. SSDI is based on how long you worked and how much you made during that time. The formula is a bit confusing but the work has to be fairly recent and for more than 4-5 years.  SSDI payments are based in the same way you get Social Security payments after 65, only it's about 2/3 of what you'd get if you turned 65.  With SSDI, you can have unlimited resources (both money and possessions) and can even work part-time, on a limited basis.  After two years on SSDI you automatically get Medicare.  There are federal and sometimes state programs to help pay for Medicare costs if the income level is low enough.


SSI is for those who have not worked enough or recently to qualify for SSDI. SSI assumes poverty. You are limited to how much possessions you can own (outside of a house and car) and any other income is calculated differently. SSI does not include Medicare but the payments are fixed (and at an amount less than you would get with SSDI) so it's likely the recipient can qualify for state-based support such as Medicaid and SNAP.

The best thing your girlfriend and aunt can do before getting to the SSA office is to have their ducks in a row.  Put together data on every doctor the aunt has seen, names, addresses, phone numbers, etc. Get the exact date of diagnosis, and the dates (and locations, if different) of any tests run that are related to the diagnosis.

The more information the SSA can get their hands on, the easier the process goes.",3,,3,0,0,

My husband will be filling out his SSA-454-BK shortly as soon as we verify when blood tests were completed/emergency room visit dates/etc.  

Back in Fall of 2013, my husband tried to attend a community college.  I accompanied him that day (because I knew he might go batshit), and he decided the same day, after the very first class that he could not continue any of his on-campus courses.  He tried switching to an online setup, and found that the stress from the homework was too much.  
He was a ""student"" for less than two weeks.  Does he include this information on Section 7?  Or should we just note it in Section 11?  (Or both?)

*EDIT:  I thought of another question.  What's the easiest way for us to obtain Emergency Room records?  I know he has a few, but I also know my husband will have to personally talk to someone in order to get them.  I know he will freak out when I tell him he needs to talk to someone to get these.  (I would do it for him if I could, but I know they're going to cite privacy laws, and HIPA and all that.)  Can he sign something giving the SSI office full disclosure to obtain any and all records?  We have nothing to hide.  (Would having him fill out a Power of Attorney form help us, making it so he wouldn't have to talk to anyone, and I could obtain his records for him?  Would we just have to go get it notarized, or do you know if it costs more than that because a lawyer would need to draft said form?  Our bank has a notary, I think he could manage to sit there with me while a form like that was notarized as long as I went with him.)

While you have some historical documentation of your condition what SSA is going to look for is how you are CURRENTLY functioning. Without current treatment they will have to rely on that exam. 

While they can still deny you even if you go to the exam it is important to note that if you do not go to the exam they will do a ""failure"" denial of your claim. There are essentially two types of denials: medical and technical. Medical denials are the typical ones (ie your condition isn't severe enough to prevent you from working). Technical denials include things like being over-resources, not insured, and all 'failure to cooperate' situations. Medical denials, for SSI, can be reopened and reversed for 2 years after the decision. Technical denials cannot.

 Why is this important? Well lets say that you are denied this time and you don't appeal. Next year you apply again and they decide you are disabled and the medical records support reopening the previous claim and allowing you back to 2015. You'll get a whole chunk of back-pay from that.

So not just you OP, everyone reading this. Go to the exams. Even if you think that they are unnecessary or you don't understand why they want you to go or whatever the reason is.

But very few people want to think of themselves as disabled (I would say even moreso for those of us with chronic pain types) so they continue to try to compete on that level.

006537ac-d699-4c1d-8cb7-10347d07182a,1450878536,"Disability is a complex category whose definition can shift somewhat wildly based on context. Through the ADA (and the Rehab Act before that) disability exists in large part as a *legal* definition. It sounds silly but these days we ""exist"" in a number of ways. In so far as people know and concepualize *you*, you exist as an idea in their head where your level of (dis) ability has varying significance, you exist to them physically though perhaps digitally as well if you have a Facebook profile where your photos, posts, and other information about yourself are curated to construct a version of  ""you"". You also ""exist"" as a person on paper to the a variety of institutions and bureaucracies.  

There is always a gap between these though. Any photo on your profile is inevitably from the past and thus does not perfectly represent you as you presently are. Maybe you've acquired a disability through age, accident, or otherwise. You may subjectively experience the physical challenges and limitations that come with your condition, and furthermore your friends and family may see you differently placing your condition at varying levels of importance in their overall understanding of you,  yet it may take your insurance six months or more to recognize you as someone with a disability. 
 
It's interesting because while ability exists on a spectrum, the legal infrastructure and insurance has added a binary categorization which often overtakes our thinking; too often we are goaded into thinking of disability as something you either do or do not have when the reality is far murkier. In a legal sense you may qualify, though it sounds like at a subjective level it's just not hitting home for you right now. I'd ask you though, even if disability is not effecting you presently, how does it effect you *potentially*? You may have no interest whatsoever in military service, but does your disability eliminate that as an option you could *ever* consider? Have you ever rehearsed explaining it to a real or potential lover? How might this condition serve to complicate your life as the inevitable changes of age and life in general take effect? Would it add complexity to managing diabetes? Does it create a different heirarchy of options for you when it comes to cardio training? 

Even if these are not current  issues in your life and never have been, they *may* be, and the odds are that in some ways these are things you have considered and integrated into the story you tell yourself about yourself. These are the more subtle effects of disability. ",5,,5,0,0,

The feedback we received indicated this was too subjective, so we decided to create a website where users would be able to rate the websites against handful of accessibility-related metrics themselves, providing a larger and more diversified sample size. Users can select a broad category (vision impairment, motor skills, etc) and provide feedback on various categories (ability to navigate, organization, etc) as well as add tags (resizable text, color based instructions) while writing a review, which other users can then search upon.

You're not pathetic. I know, I'm just a stranger on the net, what the fuck do I know right? The thing is, that when you have a disability that severely affects your life, your life is different. What a lot of people do, including myself, is measure ourselves up to this template of other people the same age and torture ourselves with what society expects of us by that age.

But the problem is that society doesn't yet have a template for 'my joints suck and nerve pain makes me want to jump in a freezer'. And because everyone's disability is a little different, we all need slightly different templates. Society can't make something realistic for us to compete against, it only has the standard 'by X age you should have a career, y age a house, z age a family' etc etc. And we realistically have to do things differently.

You make your own template based on *you*, not on what society thinks you should be compared to others. And you take that template and go right the fuck ahead and compete with it as hard as you can, because that's how we improve. Your template is living with family and getting help with finances, and all the other things you do in life. So take the other things you do in life and compete with them to do better, a little bit at a time. For me, that's exercising. I hate it, I'm much slower than probably everyone else I know, but compared to my template, I'm doing fucking awesome. I'm improving, I'm helping my body, and I'm slowly but surely getting faster. I don't want to assume what's in your life but I'm damn sure there are things you can kick the arse out of. 

Your life is different. That's cool. Don't beat yourself up about it.  Stop comparing yourself to what you think you should have done by 40. Use the time you spend thinking about that to think about your own template, to do your own fucking thing and OWN it. Because you damn well can. ",2,,2,0,0,

The nice thing about him being approved for SSI pending the SSDI determination is that he is receiving Medicaid as a result. This covers a lot...so the benefit is much more than the sub $200 cash benefit.

This person spends a large chunk of their day in the classroom with you and so they are going to have some insight. You stated that you received the accommodation? So, then wouldn't logic dictate that, in this instance, it helped you?

I used to do community mental health and case management services. I can't tell you how many times I had conversations with schools and medical providers about my clients. To be clear, nothing that would violate HIPPA, but sometimes someone who only sees a person 1 or 2 times per month gains a lot of insight from information given to them by someone who sees the person regularly.

Are the interpreters supervised by the school or an outside agency? I would start with whoever directly supervises them to make the change. They may not feel wholly comfortable not answering questions from the school (since this is how they make their money) but if they have ""back up"" from their supervisor they may feel differently. Or just have direct conversations with your interpreter (I don't know if you have regular ones or ones that rotate) and let them know you don't think its ok. ",1,,1,0,0,

37f84417-f829-4671-99d3-7ee8393787ad,1450879738,"Interesting question. I mean, the WHO definition for impairment and disability are the following:

Impairment: a loss or abnormality of psychological, physiological, or anatomical structure or function.

Disability: any restriction or lack (resulting from an impairment) of the ability to perform an activity in the manner or within the range considered normal for a human being.

So, if we're going by these definitions, you'd almost definitely fall into the impairment category due to having what is classed as a ""congenital malformation"". But having an impairment isn't the same as having a disability.

As for the disability definition - it would really depend on how much not having a prosthetic would affect you. And then there's the question of how do you define ""an activity"" and what sorts of activities are included. Is running an activity? Or by activity do we just mean whatever you do in your daily life - perhaps running is not something you've ever had to do and therefore should not be included as an activity. Do you see what I mean? I use running as an example because I imagine it might be harder or more tiring to run a few laps around the pitch without a prosthetic in comparison to someone without a limb deficiency (apologies if i'm wrong about this). My point is you might not be a great runner but that doesn't change the fact that you're obviously very capable of carrying out most daily tasks without a prosthetic like you wrote.

There are actually standardized disability tests, used to determine whether something is classed as a disability or not. Even though these have been developed and refined over long periods of time, they actually aren't very good as far as I remember - though it has been a long time since I learnt about them. 

I mean, ultimately, in grey areas like yours I think the individual should have some of a say in whether or not something gets classed as a disability. If someone truly feels they aren't disabled by an impairment then they're probably better placed to decide that than an ambiguous definition. It's obviously different in more black and white cases where there's less room for ambiguity.

i feel like librarians may be keenly aware of this, but perhaps they are just as clueless as the general public - how incredibly high the adult illiteracy rate in the united states is. depends on who you cite, but the consensus seems to be that ~20% of american adults read below a 5th grade level.

i feel this sub tends to focus more on physical disabilities than emotional or learning ones (could be wrong on that, not super active here), and that may be more what you're asking about, but i have direct experience with this sort of thing. i used to volunteer for a wonderful non-profit called [learn to read jax](http://www.learntoreadjax.org/) that trained literacy tutors for work in classroom settings, as well as one-on-one tutoring. they asked me to be a one-on-one tutor, and my student was autistic, severely dyslexic and had pretty heavy emotional issues. as a tutor i felt i was properly trained and given good workbooks to use, and the people (literally i think 2 actual employees) who ran the place were a great resource.

this non-profit was a bit separate from the jacksonville public library system (though their office was in the main downtown library), but they operated though the library and their facilities.

tl;dr - adult illiteracy is a major problem almost anywhere you go in the country, rural or city. it's something that isn't talked about very much because people learn to cope and most illiterate adults are functionally illiterate - they get by. but it's a major source of shame for them and we can make it easier. many of these people are learning and/or emotionally disabled, and adult illiteracy is a worthy cause that i think every public library should consider addressing.

2334d451-bd2e-4be0-b7e2-3c6c3ca418a3,1450735355,"I use a power wheelchair and am an avid movie goer.  I generally find that when you need to book the companion seats next to the wheelchair space, there is usually a pop-up warning that it's for a companion.  I've encountered the same thing when purchasing tickets to concerts, sporting events, etc.  I like what /u/2ee62f8d-4e9b-400e-a48d-7a45bf223151 suggested about being able to purchase the companion seat, but you may need to be moved if someone needs it.  Then it's their choice to gamble on that seat.

The problem isn't the theater.  The most important issue is that the wheelchair spaces are *almost never taken*.  It's a rare occasion that I go to a movie and see someone else in a wheelchair.  Wouldn't it seem ridiculous if the theater reserved 6-20 of the best seats for people that probably won't even be there?

And yes, I do think that it's reasonable to expect that you purchase your tickets for something like Star Wars ahead of time to make sure that you get reasonable seats.  Isn't that what everyone else needs to do?  It doesn't sound like the fandango screenshot was taken when you first tried to purchase tickets, but it still demonstrates the importance of purchasing tickets in advance for a big blockbuster movie on its first Saturday of screenings.

Heck, I try to show up to general admission shows relatively early (~15 min for a movie that will be 1/3 full) because I know that I sit tall in my wheelchair.  There are those people that like to take the seats behind the wheelchair space because they can put their feet up on the bars.  Unless you're out for vengeance for their desire to put their feet up, I think that it's only fair to show early to indicate, ""If you want to put your feet up, you're going to deal with this big head in your view.""

Anyway, I say all this to suggest that this is only slightly at the fault of the theater, if at all.

Sure, there are probably a couple of changes that could be made.  Perhaps only release the companion seats once all of the other seats are taken.  But those front row seats are god-awful… They might as well not even have them in the theater.  Maybe they should release the companion seats when every ""acceptable"" seat is taken.  Where is the line?

Perhaps you could reserve the companion seats online but only be able to take the seats once you show up in person and proof that you need the wheelchair space and a companion seat.

What about theaters where the seats are general admission?  Do we need security guards ensure that the companion seats are not being taken by people who don't need it?  It almost seems necessary, but it's a little insulting as a human being.",5,,5,0,0,

(I was going to suggest Craigslist's Volunteers section, but then discovered that it's not used in Australia like it is in the US.)

Talk to any low-cost or free medical clinics, as well as food banks, near you. They often need people to handle basic paperwork, or help greet people.

Like animals?  Animal shelters are always looking for people to come in just to play with the animals and keep them socialized.

The unable to keep a schedule might be an issue for some places, but some may have the flexibility to have drop-in volunteers.

As for making money - look into things like Amazon's Mechanical Turk (which literally pays pennies... but it adds up over time). You can also do online polls which pay in points that you can then use to purchase things like gift cards.  (I do polls for Harris Polls and it gets me $50-70 of cards per year.

If a non-disabled person goes to the movie theater, there is *no guarantee* that he will be able to find seats next to his friends and/or date.  If they pre-purchase tickets with assigned seating, there's no guarantee they be able to purchase seats next to each other.

If we demand that disabled people must be allowed to sit with their friends, then non-disabled people may start claiming to be disabled to use those seats.

This is probably why venues raise the prices on disability seating, to discourage this kind of abuse. The price increase to people who actually need these seats isn't an ethical solution, but its hard to find an effective ethical solution when combating unethical people.

I spent the latter part of my twenties wondering if I would ever meet someone that wouldn't consider me a burden.  People with disabilities will often tell you that their disability doesn't define them. But what you fail to deduce from that is that you should stop defining them by their disability.  While I understand that your parents have the best of intentions, I'm disgusted that after two years, they don't love him like a son or that they can't see past his vision loss and recognize who he is as a PERSON.  Any other reason they may not approve of your relationship? 

As for employment, let me just call some serious donkey bullshit on their theory.  There are many low vision aids (such as digital magnifiers, CCTVs, esight, text to speech software....) that can bridge a gap to make a ""regular job"" easier for those of us with reduced or limited vision. There are services often offered by the state at no cost (vocational rehabs, bureau of services to the blind, etc) that can provide you with or help you obtain these devices.  If he's studying anything computer/technology related, he's employable. It helps if he has some confidence as well. But I suppose that at such a young age, likely not knowing anyone else with the disease and hearing his girlfriend's parents' ever so insightful opinions of his capabilities, seems reasonable he might have some self doubt. 

I have no opinion on whether you should continue the relationship. That is your decision alone. But know that if you break up with him, meet a great guy with some executive level position, have a family and live the unbelievably convoluted definition of ""The American Dream,"" it doesn't guarantee you happiness, a stress free life, or any sense of entitlement.  The same is true if you marry this guy tomorrow. Relationships are work. Love is work.  Life is work.

I will leave you with this: under no circumstances should you remain in this relationship due to some sense of obligation. No one wins.

That said: Trump would be fighting against a less unstable Democratic party. Sanders is getting a lot of unexpected support, to the point where political scientists are just starting to wise up to this, and if he gets the nomination, I'm pretty sure the skeptics of the party will stand behind him in an anti ""whoever is the Republican nominee"" stance, because *everyone who is running for the republican ticket sucks.* Every single one of them. I'm actually impressed by the absurdity of it. 

And Congress can't even agree with itself. The House Speaker debacle was pretty damn impressive, Trump has only ever gotten 1/4th of the vote, and the Tea Party still is rearing its head.

If she can, it would likely take 2-3 years of 

a) consistently seeing her doctor with consistent, detailed notes about exactly *how* her symptoms prevent her from working 

b) being entirely unable to work and entirely unemployed

c) making appeals until she gets a hearing with a judge, and hiring a disability lawyer, who will be able to claim some of the initial lump sum intended to pay back her debts from sitting around fighting social security for 2-3 years while bringing in no money. (I forget the exact percentage, it's not much, but it's still a sizable bit) 

Additionally, some states have a state disability you can get while applying for SSI/SSDI, but this may have to be payed back out of your back payment or if you lose your final appeal. In my state it was only ~$200/month, and between that and the lawyer, I got less than 1/3rd of my total back payment. 

You need to prove that she is too disabled to do *any* significant work *anywhere in the country*, with *any reasonable accommodations*, including work requiring further education or retraining if she is under 50, with specific examples of her limitations in that regard, and how they would affect her ability to work. Social security does not care whether you can afford further schooling or to relocate. If you could work if you were able to afford it, you are not considered ""disabled"" by their standards. They don't care if the ""reasonable accommodations"" are such that no employer would hire you when they can hire someone who is less trouble, as to them that is a matter for ADA and the courts. If theoretically you could work if the employer would allow you the accommodations, your aren't considered ""disabled"" by their standards. 

It's totally possible, and she would likely win her appeal eventually. She's right about how hard it would be though.

I use distraction a lot. Your distraction will depend on your symptoms. Muscle issues - Sometimes gentle stretching. Video games, especially ones with a good plot, getting sucked into a story is a great help. Same goes with films. I'll talk to a friend and get them to tell me about their day. I'll have a luxurious bath and listen to music. If my hands are good I colour. I have a bunch of adult colouring books (very detailed) and it can take a lot of focus. A lot of people use it as part of their mindfulness techniques. Some people read or do crafts, personally they don't work for me but they do tremendously for some. Nerve pain I use the distractions above as much as possible, but sometimes it's such a pain in the ass I end up sitting in front of the open freezer or in the shower to get them to shut the fuck up.

If there's any sort of social services office, hotline, or website I suggest going there first.
After that you could look around for food banks. 

Depending on where you live the only social services may come from churches, and those could be worth looking into if you feel comfortable enough with it. 

For the gym, a church with a gym or YMCA may be your best bet. Some schools also offer their gym to the public for reasonable prices at odd hours. However, there's plenty of ways to get exercise without the use of a gym, and sometimes getting out in the sun is as important to our mental health as the actual exercise. 

As for the rent this get a little tricky. Social services is probably your only bet. See if they can provide any sort of assistance. Unfortunately though, even in countries with much better disability support than the US, rent can still be a difficulty, and the reality may be that you simply can't afford to continue living where you do, how you do. 

Roommates, family, and government housing are a standard for many of us around the world. A pretty useless answer, but hopefully you can balance things out and find a way to make it all work. ",3,,3,0,0,

I don't agree that this is a situation of ridiculous injustice.    


  
It seems perfectly reasonable to have to buy tickets far in advance for big shows (no matter what your mobility status).     
It seems reasonable to sell companion seats without vetting purchasers.  (Especially because most of the time people buy those seats knowing that they may need to give up that seat if someone needs it for it's intended purpose.)   
 It seems reasonable for it to fall to PWD to ask others who don't need the seat to move for people who do.    
For non-assigned seating, it seems reasonable for any movie goer to have to come early if they want to make sure they sit with their friends (and in a seating location that isn't horrible).    
   
  
Yeah, we have less seating options than able bodied people, but with a little planning and flexibility on our part, that really shouldn't be a problem.  If we want the same movie experience as everyone else we have to take the same responsibility as everyone else.   ",4,,4,0,0,

People nearly always fail to fully grasp the idea of *uneven ability* and *presumption of competence*. They also commonly mistake a difference of perspective as a lack of rationality or competence. 

You can't know what someone can't tell you unless you look hard. Most people don't, even some parents miss signs of hidden competence. People get the stereotype of the kid doing advanced theoretical physics, but can't tie his shoes. Fewer know of the man who can't talk and whose body language is so far from normal no one sees his attempts to communicate as anything more than more stimming/weirdness of his ""usual sort"". 

Or the woman in the NICU trying not to cry, who lost her words from stress and has to sit there listening to nurses asking her husband if he'd like to look into residential options for her, and if she knows how to shower and eat by herself while he tries to explain she's not retarded before she can go see her baby.

You can't see what goes into the apparently ""irrational"" decision a person is making. 

Why would a *sane* person refuse to see a doctor about a mild concern with an easy cure, but a time difference of several days with prescription versus several months of careful home care, especially when they *know* they have executive functioning skills and it will be a large burden on them to keep up with home care? 

I went through 14 years of misdiagnosis and mistaken treatment. I lose the ability to talk around doctors. I go from almost fully verbal to the communication ability of a toddler. It's not far after that to go fully non-verbal and overload/meltdown. That simple prescription run or checkup could cost me everything if that doctor thinks it's in my best interest to insist on further investigation into the question of my competence. The ER is worth it only if I risk slow death, the doctor only if it can't be treated at home. The ER isn't even worth it for quick death for me. No sense in saving me from a quick death for the life of suffering if my parents could sue for custody of an incompetent. 

I don't really want to explain that to the person pressuring me to get some bug bites checked out. I very much dislike people implying that since I can('t) do *X*, I *must* be (in)capable of *Y*. 

I know this is not anyone's fault. These kind of assumptions seem to happen naturally for people. I just think that this is where some of the most horrific things that still happen to disabled people most often originate, and that it is a good thing to keep in mind.

We've done a couple of versions with a Seat Alhambra and a VW Sharan (same vehicle different brands). Anyway the model has sliding back doors so they can lift in the wheelchair onto the folded down, with a winch or hoist. Both these adaptations could be removed so that the user could use the back seat for passengers. 

I have pictures if you're interested in seeing the end result. It's probably not be a good solution for your Mazda because of the rear doors but still I'd thought I'd give you an idea on how some people choose to solve the issue of lifting in their wheelchair.  ",1,,1,0,0,

If not, you may find it difficult to find funding support, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. I would also suggest applying for a medicaid waiver for your child - it takes years to be approved and your child may need it later.

If you do have medicaid, I would ask your doctor's office to help you. I know medicaid does provide some respite/home health care, but I don't really know the details. 

There may be agencies that work directly with medicaid to provide these workers. If it is up to you to find a person and then medicaid will pay for it, I would try local colleges that have nursing, physical/occupational/speech therapy, or special education as majors. 

Has your child ever been seen in any sort of special needs/complex care clinic at a children's hospital? You might want to consider that as they usually have social workers on staff who know a lot about this sort of thing. Good luck!",2,,2,0,0,

Bipolarity, Autism, OCD, blindness, Deafness, psychological disability, in general, ADHD, Tourette's, obesity, etc. are used as insults in one way or another, sometimes against people without that disability and sometimes against the people with that disability.

It boils down to a lack of respect for disabled people. We need to accept (whether or not the disabled person likes their disability) that disability is a fact of life that, if you don't die prematurely, will happen to you in one way or another if it hasn't happened already. While different disabilities have different needs and I know first-hand that even within the same disability, people don't agree, disabled people should unite to fight for respect.

If you have access to a computer (public library) than you can freelance by offering some sort of service (writing, graphics design, whatever your talent is). It's really hard to build a reputation, but you just gotta push through it and work at it like any businesss. Like all freelance sites, a commission is taken off &amp; you do have to wait for each transaction to come through. Keep in mind its very nontraditional in terms of work hours; you're  offering your services to the globalized world of the internet, after all. There are many nights where I have stayed up late working on projects! 

Surviving with a disability is hard because no matter what you'll always be on a fixed income, but over time you get used to it. You learn tips and tricks to stretch every dollar. For me, it keeps me focused in that I feel that I am less of a material-person in the society we live in today. Even from the time I was a kid, I never really had much so I don't feel like I miss much, you know? If I have nice things it's because I got them as gifts from family or friends. Back when I was employed, I tried to be just as generous as these friends (as few as they were) had been to me, but now my situation has changed because I'm in school &amp; can't work. Still, my expenses in life haven't changed, but I try to stay positive. 

If you can, get in touch with a local organization in your area. They may be able to guide you more specifically in what resources you are seeking. I would definitely use the time your friend has offered you a place to stay to look for ANY and ALL work. Everyday, make it your mission to be at at your local workforce commission's job fair. Go to interviews and be on the look out for anything job-related. If you go somewhere always as if they are hiring! Ideally, you should never walk out the door without copies of you resume in hand ready to go. You never know who you might meet so treat everybody you meet like they might be a potential employer!

- If you assist them socially be cool with it but careful not to take over in social situations.

- Trust (depending on disability) that your client really does know how to best do things, they also don't necessarily have to explain why they want things done a certain way. As you become more experienced it's ok to occasionally suggest ways you think tasks could be improved to make things easier for the client but always ask what they think first.

The next step is you need the platform to be as big as possible.  Normally these units have 4 pressure pads to read weight, so the platform just rests on these 4 things.  My idea is to take a big piece of plywood (2.5x2.5'?), and attach the 4 pressure pads to the corners of the plywood.  You'll have to account for the weight of the plywood, but most of these scales have ""tare"" functions anyway.

Then you have a platform you can roll onto that will show your weight.  The only thing I don't know is if increasing the distance covered by the pressure pads would affect measurement.

I suffer from chronic daily migraines and narcolepsy, so I have my days I am not well too. 

We get a LOT of help. We go to the food pantry weekly. We go each week to a little community dinner that is free, that is for people who are struggling like us. Our families help tremendously, but even they are getting stretched thin. Our church has been such a blessing. They have paid our mortgage and utilities several times. We also work with two local charity organizations that set us up with a variety of kinds of assistance. One was a frozen meat food pantry, a cleaning supply charity, and a personal care charity. 

We made a GoFundMe page, which helped so so much. We were overwhelmed with people's generosity. 

My dads cousin actually created a foundation to help underprivileged kids get to preschool, and our daughter began preschool today thanks to the foundation. 

Obviously everything depends on what is available in your area. Most of the assistance we rely on is all local. We get no food stamps or welfare. 

As much as I hate to say this, even if you aren't religious, take advantage of the free meals that churches offer. We have a ""coffee hour"" after church every Sunday but it can be as little as a breakfast casserole or as much as a full brunch depending on who is providing it. They also serve dinner at ladies night every other Thursday, so it's one more meal I don't have to worry about. More often than not, I go to church for the food. I love my church and am very involved in many aspects, but the food gets us there. 

Sometimes I have as little as $20 a week to use towards food. I shop at Aldi because that's where I get the best deals. If I don't shop there, I only use coupons. 

One thing you could do is figure out what kind of things you are capable of. Could you clean houses for money?  Could you be an after school nanny just for a few hours a day until parents get home from work?  What about a dog walker or someone who checks on animals while people are away?

I realize that mileage varies from state to state, disability to disability, and individual to individual.  I'm going into my freshman year of college this coming Fall as a legally blind student.  Voc rehab in my state is going to cover tuition that isn't covered by scholarships or other awards up to the most expensive state school in my home state, room and board, textbooks, and equipment.  I have already received a Texas Instruments TI-84 Plus Orion talking graphing calculator.  I have been told that they will cover a new laptop and monitor for me in addition to some other computer stuff like screen reading software and magnification software.  This is in addition to other low vision technology and aids that I will need to be successful in college but that are also, unfortunately quite expensive.

&amp;nbsp;

My primary caseworker is amazing and extremely responsive and helpful.  I also have an awesome orientation and mobility specialist assigned through the state that works with my primary caseworker who makes sure that I have what I need.  She just ordered me a new ultra light cane and ceramic tip, and they are organizing sessions for me to get used to some different turning styles for when I go to get my guide dog in June.  It has been made very clear to me that the agency is committed to making sure that I am successful in college so long as I continue to put forth the effort and drive to be successful.

Also, a friend in a wheelchair actually sits in the theater seats and just parks his chair next to the seat. So he could be viewed as someone just buying a companion ticket. It just seems that it may be complicated for the ticket issuer to make sure that those who need these seats are given a preference. 
    
On that note, however, I think it would be REALLY simple to include a CAPITAL, in BOLD disclaimer for anyone purchasing companion seats which says that if they are not disabled or accompanying a disabled person, they may be required to move to accommodate a disabled person. That way, you can buy a ticket as long as tickets are still available and then just show up at the theater. The usher would have to tell them to move.",11,,11,0,0,

The trouble here is, Fandango doesn't care what seats are what (well that's putting it strongly -- they don't go around inspecting every theater and classifying every moviegoer, that's all). Regal at Destiny does not have handicapped seating -- it has handicap spaces where you can park a chair (these were my home for several years). Other theaters I've been to have both, or just seats (you park your chair in the open spot and one of the seats, for the ticket you bought, goes unsat). 

I don't know if it's a fire code thing, or a Destiny thing, or a Fandango thing, or what. 

Here's what I do know -- reserving one seat for companions won't help MUCH. It would totally cover your situation for Star Wars -- but what about when I took the whole family out for Django Unchained? Is the theater supposed to sit on five seats in case I roll up? **At some point**, and I am **NOT** making any guesses at which, this becomes an unreasonable burden.

A nation-wide phenomenon like Star Wars 7 is one of those situations. Understand -- people would sell their children to get into a theater on opening night. Destiny IMAX is *still* sold out round-the-clock. They have to let those tickets go -- maybe not IMMEDIATELY, but eventually, yes, it has to happen. Literally tens of millions of people moved mountains to get into those opening weekend seats -- shit, I had to hop up ten rows and down the aisle, but I got there, and it wasn't easy. 

Long and short.... should something happen about this whole situation? Yeah, definitely. I don't think this is the perfect case that proves the flaw (though it's certainly the most marketable you'll ever see, so seriously, go nuts, visibility helps). In the meantime, check out the RPX theater, same cinema -- or Real-D 3d (which is actually better screen resolution than the local IMAX, or so I'm told by tech nerds), with the ADDED benefit of no assigned seating (so you WILL be able to get those companion seats -- the ushers will take care of you, they're good people)",3,,3,0,0,

The major issues seem to be electrical problems and A/C issues. The A/C is always going out. And any time there's an electrical issue it's almost impossible for regular repair shops to resolve it because of the aftermarket adaptations that have been made. So it has to go back to the people who made the modifications, and it takes forever and is expensive.",2,,2,0,0,

Prosthetics have improved even over the course of my life, but I've got so little room down there for new technology that it's very likely I'll have the same types of legs forever, and I'm not sure if it will be more difficult to use it as I get older.

I've got separate issues preventing me from joining the military, so I never considered that either.  But I've never had a problem explaining it to people, so I'm covered in that regard :)

In the state of Connecticut, for example, there is the Bureau of Rehab Services. They provide various services and accommodations to help you keep working such as home or vehicle mods. There are other services they provide as well, but the main ones I've been trying to get help with personally are the mods.

In regards to your transportation situation, if you can't drive or take the bus, you should be eligible for your state's paratransit services. It's a door to door shared ride service for people who can't take the bus due to a disability. As long as you live not too far from a bus route, they will be able to pick you up.

Now, you could get SSI if you literally cannot work at all. However, SSI is very draconian. It's purely based on financial need. If you live with anyone, or have any income whatsoever, they'd deduct it from your SSI benefit. You could only have up to 2k in savings with them as well. SSI, if I'm not mistaken, could at most be $733 per month.

If, however, you worked enough in the past, you would have enough work credits to be eligible for SSDI, which is far better. It tends to pay more than SSI, and they don't constantly monitor your funds and income as much as for SSI.

Also, a word of advice, when trying to apply for any of these programs, they will try to discourage you from applying by saying you're not eligible. Do your own research beforehand and be assertive with them. At the very least, you'll be able to get a meeting with some kind of caseworker hopefully. Also, from what I heard, most applications for SSI/SSDI tend to be rejected on the first try. If you do get rejected, reapply and get a lawyer.

I hope this helps.",5,,5,0,0,

You are, technically, disabled. But you're not necessarily significantly impaired by your disability. A similar dynamic applies to the vision loss that affects many, many people - they don't see using glasses every day as ""disabled,"" even though technically it is. (Heck, describing the use of common glasses as a disability is not often met with happy reactions.)

In any case, if I were in your position, I'd be hesitant to let this answer affect me much. For you, it seems like it would be more a label than anything useful. As others pointed out, it *may* become an issue, but don't *make* it become one.",8,,8,0,0,

Anyway, I'm in a power wheelchair, on a ventilator, with pretty bad speech. A lot of people don't know how to react to me, it feels like. Just talk to me like I'm anyone else. My reading and writing abilities are/were above average, but being treated as mentally handicapped is a frustrating, common experience. Don't do that ;)

If you don't understand my speech, please don't act like you know what I said or try to brush me off. Everyone has their own solution to speech... Mine is to start off talking and, when you can't understand me, either pull out my tablet to use as a speechboard or write what I said on paper. But I prefer speaking; it's faster, generally easier, and more ""natural."" One great tactic is telling me where in the sentence you misunderstood, as it lets me (and you!) focus on repeating one word or one part. 

Other than that, I don't need many accommodations or help beyond the typical wheelchair ones (door buttons, lower books, etc.). I use computers with ease... So one thing is, because of my speech, I prefer communicating in email or whatever text format. Since I never use phones, I have no other way of getting a hold of librarians other than in person.
