Also can some, if not all, of your workload be done at your home so you can have a Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunneled from your home to the office? A VPN is basically an encrypted, secure network connection between your home and the office and you have access to everything that you would normally find on your work computer, on your laptop and you may need a smart card to sign you in, given the security risks of working for the government. 

An assistant should be able to upload documents to a folder for you to access from home and you can do the work from there like scheduling, managing payrolls and all that you do. 

As far as interacting with your colleagues but you have to be at home, maybe they can set up a videophone for you and a designated spot at the office where the colleague can go in and talk to you face to face via videophone? 

Ehh, this is the best I can imagine what the scenario is like at your workplace and if this does not sound fittingly for you, at least I tried my best to help you out. 

But yeah, it would be wise to get legal help as they would know what to do. I would still talk to an ADA advocacy group about this, they may provide legal help free of charge and will act on your behalf for free. At least that's what the advocacy group did for me a few times, free of charge given my financial situation and my disability. 

I understand the financial situation you are in but if you happen to be let go (hope not!), you can apply for disability benefits through the Social Security Administration. When that happens, hopefully the income would be substantial to hold you over til the situation is taken care of on the legal side!

I know the tasks that I need the dog to do, so when I applied to a SD (service dog) program, I'd ask if they could train XYZ tasks.  This was an effort to avoid disclosing my diagnoses.  

Invariably, they'd ask me what I was diagnosed with.  I told them, ""PTSD, depression, schizophren...."" and they'd run for the hills.  I applied to 36 different SD programs in a span of about two years.  These were all programs who specifically train and place psychiatric SDs.  You'd think they would understand psychiatric disabilities.  

But the second I disclosed my schizophrenia, they'd ignore me.  They stopped responding to my emails, my letters, and in some cases would not return messages by phone, either.  Close to 90% of the programs I'd previously been communicating with just FINE suddenly refused to acknowledge me.  One program even emailed me back specifically for the purpose of telling me that schizophrenics should not have a SD, and should never be allowed to use a SD!!!

One program out of 36 told me they'd work with me, but they wanted $10,000 dollars.  In the end, I found a private SD trainer, not a program, to work with.  

There's no shortage of dogs, no.  But for the best chance of success, you'd need to start with a purebred puppy whose exposure to various situations was closely monitored early in life.  Less than 1 out of 100 rescued dogs have what it takes to be a SD.

Personally, I can't say that I feel like there's ableism. I do think though that the education system is not well designed to take account of different strengths and abilities, but that's not exclusive to those with disabilities. I did very well at school and mostly I had teachers who recognized my potential. I did have a headmaster who refused to give me extra time during exams though (because my hands get weak and floppy when they get tired). Thanks to my mum being really persistent he granted me like 15% extra time in my exams, which wasn't enough but it was better than nothing. This meant I managed to complete most (not all) of my exams. Nevertheless, I managed to graduate with good grades.

My brother, who isn't disabled, didn't do so well. Not because he wasn't clever or hardworking, but because the system doesn't favour people like him. I had a good memory and it didn't really matter if I understood what I was learning or not. My brother had a poor memory but was keen to actually understand what he was learning. I got all As, he got Bs and Cs. I don't feel like the education system is well set up to bring out the best potential in some people but to be honest I don't think it has a lot to do with ableism.

Thinking of people with disabilities in general, it's absolutely not unusual for a caregiver to get overenthusiastic or overly protective and have it border into controlling- I see it a fair amount with the clients I serve. Most of the time it is a carryover from when they had to fight tooth and nail to get any kind of help or services for their child at all and they are having trouble understanding that that's not necessary anymore, but sometimes it's financial. Is your friend his own guardian, i.e. can he make legal decisions for himself? If he is, his mother doesn't get to decide what he does any more than yours does for you. If his mother is his guardian, it gets trickier, so that's important to know.",3,0,3,0,0,

This is interesting. I like the idea and hope it will help many people out, but I can't help but think this is a bit of a means for Nike to get some great PR while using recycled technology they've been incorporating in their shoes for years. 

I've worked in a shoe store for a long time and in the process, become quite the ""sneaker history buff"" lol and aficionado. Nike and other brands have made secure fitting laceless designs since the mid 90s. Shoes like the Air Kukini, Presto Faze, Presto Cage all used elastic polymer bands for support in place of traditional laces; while others like the Air Rift used a series of velcro straps including a heel mounted strap for support similar to the one found on this upcoming release. I believe the elastic laces were first used by Nike on a pair of Jordans a few years back and there is even a company that specializes in nothing but elastic laces. 

Either way, I think it's wonderful they mish mashed all these technologies together to assist those with trouble tying their shoes and overall this will be extremely good for the sneaker industry. Nike is the leader of the industry and masters of advertising so when they promote something, even if they weren't the originators of the technology, other companies tend to follow suit very quickly. I'd expect to see a lot more shoes like this hitting the market in the coming years. 


Edit: Just looked it up and the company that makes the elastic laces is called ""Lock Laces"".  

Additionally here's a brief list of some sneakers without traditional laces for those who may be looking for different styles or simply aren't LeBron fans lol. 

-Nike Air Rift: Originally made for Kenyan Olympic runners who were accustomed to running barefoot. These use a split toe design (Like a Ninja shoe!) to mimic the foots natural movement as the Kenyans were used to running barefoot, but per Olympic rules had to wear some kind of footwear to compete. These aren't released regularly and can get a bit pricey on the resale market. They also have a rather feminine design, so probably won't be a favorite for the guys. 

-Nike Hurache 94 - Easy on easy off Velcro design with old school stylish looks. 

-Nike Kukini - Elastic polymer net that can be tightened at the heel covers the shoe in place of laces. Original Kukinis are pretty scarce but a few years ago Nike released the Kukini Free, which used the same upper with their ""free"" soles. These didn't sell to well and can still be had all over ebay for reasonable prices. 

-Puma Disc - I've always wanted these for the novelty factor, but they could be very beneficial for someone with CP or trouble with traditional laces. These use a series of wires connected to a dial in the middle of the shoe, that when turned tightens the wires providing a snug fit in place of the laces. 

-Reebok Pump Fury - These use an air bladder in place of laces, that when pumped expands to provide a snug fit. 

There are quite a few more laceless designs out there if anyone's interested, but the aforementioned list includes shoes that have been in production in the past few years and should still be relatively attainable.

Somebody mentioned a balance bike, and that reminded me of something my girlfriend's mom said earlier this month that might work.  She was talking about how balance bikes are pointless and it just makes you spend extra money on a bike that'll be worthless shortly after you buy it.  What she suggested was doing what her parents did with her.  Training wheels are often shitty little plastic wheels attached to sticks of metal.  They're terrible unbalanced and often sit higher than the actual back tire.  So what her parents did was leave the training wheels on until she could ride the bike without having the training wheels touch the ground.  Once she was able to do that, they took the training wheels off, and everything was smooth.  

Maybe training wheels today don't suck as much?  But I'm sure they're still cheap pieces of shit.  So even if the touch the ground, just take them off and bend the metal legs a little.  Just enough so they lift off the ground but still provide protection from tipping over.

Also, have you talked to your son about just taking them off?  7 1/2 is old enough where they might already have pretty decent natural balance.  He's your kid, so I guess I can't speak for that, but he may be able to handle a bike just fine without training wheels or your help.  7 years old or 17 years old, it doesn't matter at a certain point as their sense of balance reaches a certain point where they might not be necessary.",2,0,2,0,0,

If I were as disabled as I am now when I was of school age, I wouldn't have been able to attend the school I went to. I can understand that some people with disabilities do require specialised education, and for them specialist teachers are needed, but if someone has mobility issues (e.g. in a wheelchair, or can't use stairs) then they should go to a non-special educational school. 

But, said schools aren't accessible, partly due to the age of the buildings, but I think also due to the fact that anyone with a disability is bundled off to a ""special"" school instead - we don't want the disableds to interact with the rest of society, do we, hmm? To me, it fosters a segregated society, where people with disabilities are othered, and fully-abled people don't get to interact with disabled people from an early age.

Getting approved for disability is a pain in the ass, but totally doable. I also had moved to multiple states and seen many doctors at several hospitals in pursuit of diagnosis, and getting all of head records organized is a pain. But if you get them all in hand, you can prepare yourself well for your case. The records will show a pattern of symptoms and a variety of treatments. They might even contain diagnoses that you didn't know you have received. I was surprised when I read mine.. I learned a lot about my condition that doctors where not explaining to me. You will be able to provide SSA with exactly what they need to approve you. 

Also take a peek at what ""residual functional capacity"" means and what yours is. If you can, have any caretakers/significant other, therapist, regular doctor write up a testimony for you regarding the symptoms they have witnessed and attempted to treat and what prognosis they currently predict despite lack of formal diagnosis. 

Sorry some if this is redundant and all of it is hard. The good news is that you really can get approved as long as you are actually disabled and it doesn't really matter as much what the overriding condition/s are.

If possible, start getting regular treatment from a steady doctor or group of doctors and see a clinical psychologist for regular cognitive behavioral therapy sessions and you will have some pros in place who know you personally and clinically and can go to bat for you :)

As for them ""squeezing her out"" if her ambulation is really that poor they're probably trying to avoid a worker's comp case. There is the possibility that if she began using a wheelchair they would be feel more secure in her ability to manuver safely around the office and as long as she maintains her level of work, they may back off. Obviously I can't say that for certain but it's a possibility. I think a prospective employer will definitely have reservations about hiring someone who hobbles into an interview. They would be taking on a risk, and that doesn't make sense business-wise. And most employers are not going to want to hire someone who demonstrates that level of stubborness right off the bat by refusing to use an ambulation aid. Your wife has a right to do that, certainly, it's her health and her decision. But there are consequences that go along with making a choice like that.  Biggest one being The Fall.

In higher education I tend to mitigate a lot of that, because when I do make it to class, which frankly, is a lot, (I used to be absent for weeks at a time, now I tend to max out at 3 absences per class that are illness related. Everything else is documented and they have to cover for other reasons besides DSS. Like, last semester, went home twice sick, but stayed home a grievance day and for an unexpected appointment, which I had documentation for,) I am always participating in class, I clearly do (most to all) of the reading, and I manage to turn in at least 85ish percent of my homework. (Getting better all the time, as I adapt to my memory neuro stuff.) 

So I think they start off with this kid who turns in DSS accommodations, approaches them with the ones that get more regularly misused, and go ""oh come on, I hate these,"" and then they, hopefully, get reminded exactly why they exist. 

I used to go in detail about exactly what was going on with me until I got a little tired of it, and it started getting used against me.

I would ask this to anyone if I'm being blunt.  Are you a likable person?  Do people like being around you, or at the very least, don't mind being around you?  Do you give off a desperate vibe?  Cynical vibe?  Holier than thou vibe?  Anything of that nature?  Being a nice single guy can make a man bitter sometimes.  Are you one of those types that thinks to themselves, ""I'm such a nice guy, why doesn't anyone see it.  Why wouldn't someone want to date me?""  Do any of those things describe you at all?  I'm not saying they do, I'm just curious, because they're often poisonous as far as attracting women goes.

Sometimes we have to take a look at ourselves and see what we're throwing out there for others to pick up on.

I'm not the best looking guy.  I'm not terrible by any means, but I'm not every lady's cup of tea.  The ones that find me attractive REALLY find me attractive, but their tastes are not exactly traditional.  I'm a chubbier paraplegic in a wheelchair.  I don't exactly attract a stampede of ladies.  But in my time I've been hit on by plenty of women.  I'm the shy type though, so I've never really done much with it in situations like that.  But it's flattering.  I'm not loud.  I'm not obnoxious.  I don't give off a creepy vibe.  I'm pretty relaxed.  Sometimes the type that doesn't really speak up until others are talking or I have something of value to add to the conversation.  I tend to get along with women more than men.  I've had close lady friends who try to be my wing-man when out at the bar.  Again, I'm shy, so it's never really lead to much aside from me awkwardly getting a girl's number and then never using it.

I'm not saying be like me.  I'm going through a small rundown of how I am with the point being that I'm relatively aware of how I am socially and how I can be perceived.  Be aware of the vibe you put out.  Project the best parts of you out there while still being yourself.  The right people will pick up on it.  Sometimes you might not be interested, and that's ok.  Sometimes even if you're, go out on a date.  Get some experience and learn more about the other person.

I have a wonderful girlfriend that I met online.  Most of my really close friends all moved half-way across the country.

In my experience filling out the ADA form can be a double edged sword. Yes they will have to accomodate you as best they can given their resources/availability. The smaller the company sometimes the easier it is for them to claim that the accomodations are unreasonable. However, there is always a chance that it could limit your future prospects with the company. While, yes, it would be illegal for them to not promote you BECAUSE of your disability it doesn' t mean that they won't do it. It can be difficult to prove discrimination unless they flat out tell you (and have it in writing/an email) that is the reasoning. 

But I think what you need to focus on is what is going to work best for you right now. Turning in the ADA form and getting the accomodations will allow you to continue to work. From what it sounds like, your condition is not going to improve significantly over time (and may be progressive?) so making decisions only considering the long term may be moot. ",2,0,2,0,0,

The advocate took advantage of me....I AM SURE OF THAT !! The things I shared with this advocate were not supposed to be used against me or used to work out a deal with the judge. Brain fog from Lyme disease is a REAL issue and this lady knew how stressed I was the morning of my hearing. New financial concerns, brain fog, bad thyroid readings. 2 weeks prior to the court date I shared everything about Lyme disease with her. My IRAS, CDS, anything and everything monetary has gone into my arm. After explaining how it has affected me mentally and physically I felt pretty good about the info we went over. If I were the advocate I would have fought for my client or AT LEAST OPENED MY MOUTH. I don't remember much of anything she said in court and my previous advocate that retired was very good and presented any and all pertinent medical information.  I was infected in 2002 but was not properly diagnosed until 2003. Went on a treatment program in 2004 and had to quit my job of 9 years. Was suggested way back then that I go on disability but I wanted to go BACK to work after treatment. Received disability closed period ??? for 2 years. One time check for me and my children. The morning of the hearing I was very emotional. Told advocate about financial issues, thyroid problem, etc. She entered judge's room first and then came out to get me. I spoke to judge to tell him how I was feeling. Don't remember her saying much of anything. First thing I know I am being whisked into the hallway and asked if I would take a ""one time payout."" THESE ARE WORDS USED BY THE ADVOCATE. She then said to me..."" you know...like you got in Virginia."" At this point I was lost. IT DOES NOT TAKE A LOT TO GET ME CONFUSED. Did not know and/or was not advised ahead of time this could turn out to be a ""Lets make a deal situation."" I asked her would I be on disability? She said no. Then she says that the judge would give me a MORE favorable decision if I would not go back any further than 2013. At this point my thinking was completely bogged down. I asked her when did we file and are the kids supposed to get anything ??? No answer....she fumbled through papers and I think she mumbled 09 but seemed to be unable or unwilling to answer questions about my kids receiving anything. By this time I was really mentally worked up and we went back into the room with the judge and I agreed to 2013 and then I disagreed. Judge says to the advocate that she might want to take me outside to discuss again. We went back out into a hallway and then she motions the papers towards me and says: 
"" Remember things change after you are 50. Things are going to change because you are over 50."" I asked her repeatedly what does this mean? NO LEGIBLE ANSWER. She kept saying things were going to change. I went back into the judge and agreed to 2013 but by this time was under great distress. Judge asked me if I was depressed. I told him of course I was. This disease has affected me and hurt my brain. Then he asked me about my thinking and I told him it is like trying to think thru mud. Was this some sort of slap in the face question ? The last time I had a major relapse it cost me 16 + thousand dollars out of my pocket. Long term treatment of Lyme disease is not covered by most insurance companies....some will pay partial. It is like the 80's AIDS epidemic. This advocate should have should have sat me down and talked to me about what I was going to be giving up in backpay.... treatment money, the kid's money, etc. She knew I was in the fog !!! The next morning I woke up thinking I dreamed the whole thing and when I realized it had really happened, I cried my eyeballs out. I tried repeatedly to contact the advocate and could not reach her. I asked to meet with the head of the law firm and he did not want to meet with me. A call back was offered and then the advocate called me instead. The fog in my mind had lifted enough for me to realize what had happened. I told her that she did not speak on my behalf and that I was very upset. Told her I could remember important things and that I either got no answer on , a vague answer, or a very slow response. NEVER understood what the deal was with over 50 because she just kept saying: ""things are going to change after 50."" Let me make this perfectly clear. I may have some brain impairments but I AM NOT BRAIN DEAD ! I told this advocate exactly what I thought went down. What she said in response confirmed EVERYTHING. This lady was not in my corner AT ALL and I am devastated. I am seeking legal counsel at this time. Was told recently by an attorney that the over 50 rule did not even apply in my case. You know my IQ has dropped significantly since the infection but I have ALWAYS been a fighter. Used to be one sharp cookie in the computer tech areas. Brain fog, lack of retention ability, herxheimer reactions from die off of bacteria, nerve pain, loss of smell and taste, etc....the list goes on and on. NOW THIS. My work history is impeccable so why keep my backpay ??? At one point my doctor told me he did not know how I was working. Maybe it is perfectly normal for a judge to want to work out a different date other than the onset date......but this is NOT how things played out !! The judge knew I was confused.....the advocate knew I was confused. My disability was clearly used against me.....and let me add one more thing.

The SSDI check is for $760/month.  If they take away the $250, he won't have enough for the mortgage payment.  Sucks!  He does have enough for a 5% down payment; however, I was told by someone to transfer money into a ""hidden"" account so he wouldn't lose benefits.  If he lived on his own, he wouldn't have that money.  Since I could manage without charging him rent, etc, I set it aside, but perhaps that wasn't the smartest thing to do.  

I would think owning a house would be over any state's asset limits.

Both child's name is on my deed; however, my mortgage payment is far too much for him to pay, even with roommates.  Besides, the equity should be split between the kids.  I want to get rid of this large house now before I die so they won't have to deal with the mess I went through when my parents died.  

I really don't need the caretaker or any benefits for myself nor do I want the government to pay those to me when I don't need them even if I were eligible.  I only want my son to be able to live in a house and not be homeless.  I'm really concerned that if he looses the SSI, he won't be able to make the mortgage payment monthly.

Guess I need to talk to a lawyer knowledgeable about this stuff.

I guess I understand no longer wanting to work in that sort of atmosphere.  However, if she's good at what she does, her using a chair/getting around slowly shouldn't matter.  If she'd want to stay, could you look at any Aging and Disability Resources to help her legally?

With that said (and I guess sort of going into the question of finding another job), I know that some positions might spectate her working and see how much she accomplishes in a given hour.  They then base their pay on the amount of work they finish.  This might be different state to state (and personally, I've never been faced with this sort of ""trial run""), but I've seen signs that talk about doing so up in the break-room at one of my jobs.

I'd also recommend getting some help from a group called DVR (District of Vocational Rehabilitation).  In the city I live in, they share the building with a company that also aids people in finding jobs.  Though due to your wife's disability, they could give her a bit more help (whether it be disability related or how to conduct yourself in an interview) than just a regular job-seeking outfit.

Again, any future employer also shouldn't judge a hopeful employee's potential even if they are ""hobbling"" around.  I'm not saying it doesn't happen (I've heard from a previous employer after I had been hired that some managers had doubts on my abilities since I'm a wheelchair user), but chances are, she won't want to work for a company that turns her down due to her circumstances anyways.

However, if they have no pre-existing condition that could explain the symptoms then a diagnosis will be needed.

* It (disability itself) is definitely getting some traction in the US.  Lately, it's been thanks to Bernie Sanders and his relentless attack on those gutting government programs for retirees and disability.  An example is  [here!](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/republicans-want-to-cut-social_security-disability-benefits-sanders-warns)  It is associated clearly with liberal parties (Sanders considers himself a socialist, but would probably be considered a conservative in some Scandinavian and European countries).  Democrats spearheaded the ADA when it was passed 25 years ago, but some argue that is not expansive enough-I agree with this.  As someone who studies disability from a sociological perspective and from my own qualitative research, I think one of the biggest factors that limit the opportunities of those with disability is the educational system and the political, social and economic support of those with disabilities.  People with disabilities have one of the lowest representations of any population in government (if not, the very lowest).  Socialization in America, especially for men, stresses autonomy and career-orientation as major factors in the development of one's character and life.

I like the idea of using water guns: when I went to summer camp we played a game called Gold Rush, and the counselors holding water guns would guard prisoners that were captured and stuck in jail.  The only way to get out of jail would be for a fellow camper to touch your hand, but it was difficult to make it without getting sprayed by a super soaker.

Alternatively, there is a game called chess boxing that combines these two activities.  Essentially, it is a round of boxing and a set amount of chess, repeated.  The player must avoid knockout as well as checkmate.  Perhaps you could tie another game into capture the flag, maybe something more physical than chess but not so physical (rock ‘em sock ‘em robots?).  I know it is not exactly what you’re asking, but maybe it could be fun.  Good luck!

If you were born disabled and unable to work...tough luck. I really don't understand why everyone just doesn't receive the same livable income. Something around $1500/month would likely work with affordable/assisted housing. But that's just not how it is. I basically use disability for the insurance as I couldn't survive on what little monetary assistance they provide. Luckily I was able to work throughout college and a few years before my condition made most jobs impossible in my early 20's. That said, I still work when I am able, but most jobs for me in my area are low pay and seasonal. I have an IT degree, but no job offers. Generally speaking, I believe you can earn up to 25k/year in total earnings through work and disability combined without losing benefits. Of course, unless you are destitute, you won't be getting prescription drug coverage which is what empties my bank account quicker than anything.

The only trainable job offers seem to be telecommuting customer service jobs with mandatory lay-offs. Unfortunately, my sketchy hearing prevents me from taking those.

I net around $900/month. 80% medical coverage, but no prescription, no supplemental, no dental, no eyeglasses. I'm certain some people can work the system better than I and get more, but I choose to save money in the bank which won't help you get additional aid.  I also moved back in with the parents after college, which I'm sure doesn't help what I receive. I just don't see how I could survive otherwise and don't feel like scraping by on a meager existence just to claim that I'm independent.

Kidding.  Sorta.  Where I live we see temperatures as low as -50F degrees if not lower with the wind chill.  I go all winter long wearing only a hooded sweatshirt and gloves, for reasons much like you mentioned.  I'm in a wheelchair, so I'm sitting all the time.  Winter coats are big and cumbersome.  When you're sitting they bunch up.  The sides push on your wheels and you look like a big puffy mess.  Also, the arms brush up against your wheels as well.  I typically don't spend a lot of time outdoors in the winter.  Most time spent outside is going from my apartment to my car and from my car into work or a store.  Or  having a cigarette.  For these reasons, I can get by with simply wearing a hoodie.  Hoodies are thin enough that they don't bunch up and cause discomfort or get in the way.  I just wear a typical plain $15 hoodie, but you can pay a few bucks more and get something that is fleece-lined or thermal-lined.  Or invest in a thin shell jacket to wear underneath.  I tend to wear a lot of long-sleeve plaid flannel shirts as well.  Not to keep warm, it's just my style.  But those do work to my advantage as well.

The part that makes it all work is gloves.  I have poor(er) circulation in my hands.  They get cold fast and touching the metal on my chair is unbearable at -50F degrees.

4. Experiment, try new structures. Your essay is very clearly following a classic essay structure, to the point it is a bit distracting.

And be confident in who you are and what you can bring to a relationship, you don't have to express it to anyone but know yourself. (e.g you can be caring, loving, supportive, understanding) it will help you feel more confident to focus on the things you are and what you can do or offer :)
Don't give up :) It is not dumb, its just harder sometimes and can take more time. 
Good luck!",3,0,3,0,0,

f07cb753-3ba7-498f-bc51-787b42c9da4d,1435815541,"A lot of insensitive people cry about abuse to induce change in the law regarding the lack of registration/certification for service animals.  Mind you if a service animal becomes unruly (highly unlikely if the animal is trained) the animal and its handler can be asked to leave and it isn't considered discrimination.

And really, if the dog is behaving as a service animal I say who cares if it is or isn't a ""legit"" service animal.  I think that's why the law is worded the way it is.  If it is a real service animal it'll behave like one. If it isn't a ""real"" service animal but behaves like one anyway it doesn't matter.

I could be biased though, I like all dogs more than I like most people.",1,0,1,0,0,
b7b7b6ab-600f-4883-9f20-eb09d0212845,1437889643,"As previously stated, some sort of physical therapy program would certainly be recommended. Most doctors should have little issue writing you a script for it. As for keeping in shape on your own, the first, best recommended type of exercise usually seems to be aquatic based. Of course, depending on your particular circumstances, that isn't always the easiest thing to accomplish. With an artificial limb, and confidence issues, that may not be the best option for you.

When I first received my wheelchair, I'll admit I was in fairly rotten shape as I had been doing next to nothing for 6 months while waiting for it to arrive. I too had some pride issues about using it at first, but I will say, just getting outside and rolling around the neighborhood has been very helpful in improving my self-confidence and overall stamina. Who cares what other people think.

As for a home workout, I did the pool thing for awhile, but it really became a bother getting in and out of my local gym's pool. Also, most of their equipment wasn't suited for my 6'4"" frame. I have since bought a resistance based home gym and it has been helpful.  Beyond that I use free weights. Of course, just getting out there and doing anything will be helpful.

9a79a058-e30c-4f8a-947a-9fc464b61827,1437531120,"Thanks for your response... I will try to be clear about this. I have received a fully favorable decision. The advocate took advantage of me....I AM SURE OF THAT !! The things I shared with this advocate were not supposed to be used against me or used to work out a deal with the judge. Brain fog from Lyme disease is a REAL issue and this lady knew how stressed I was the morning of my hearing. New financial concerns, brain fog, bad thyroid readings. 2 weeks prior to the court date I shared everything about Lyme disease with her. My IRAS, CDS, anything and everything monetary has gone into my arm. After explaining how it has affected me mentally and physically I felt pretty good about the info we went over. If I were the advocate I would have fought for my client or AT LEAST OPENED MY MOUTH. I don't remember much of anything she said in court and my previous advocate that retired was very good and presented any and all pertinent medical information. I was infected in 2002 but was not properly diagnosed until 2003. Went on a treatment program in 2004 and had to quit my job of 9 years. Was suggested way back then that I go on disability but I wanted to go BACK to work after treatment. Received disability closed period ??? for 2 years. One time check for me and my children. The morning of the hearing I was very emotional. Told advocate about financial issues, thyroid problem, etc. She entered judge's room first and then came out to get me. I spoke to judge to tell him how I was feeling. Don't remember her saying much of anything. First thing I know I am being whisked into the hallway and asked if I would take a ""one time payout."" THESE ARE WORDS USED BY THE ADVOCATE. She then said to me..."" you know...like you got in Virginia."" At this point I was lost. IT DOES NOT TAKE A LOT TO GET ME CONFUSED. Did not know and/or was not advised ahead of time this could turn out to be a ""Lets make a deal situation."" I asked her would I be on disability? She said no. Then she says that the judge would give me a MORE favorable decision if I would not go back any further than 2013. At this point my thinking was completely bogged down. I asked her when did we file and are the kids supposed to get anything ??? No answer....she fumbled through papers and I think she mumbled 09 but seemed to be unable or unwilling to answer questions about my kids receiving anything. By this time I was really mentally worked up and we went back into the room with the judge and I agreed to 2013 and then I disagreed. Judge says to the advocate that she might want to take me outside to discuss again. We went back out into a hallway and then she motions the papers towards me and says: "" Remember things change after you are 50. Things are going to change because you are over 50."" I asked her repeatedly what does this mean? NO LEGIBLE ANSWER. She kept saying things were going to change. I went back into the judge and agreed to 2013 but by this time was under great distress. Judge asked me if I was depressed. I told him of course I was. This disease has affected me and hurt my brain. Then he asked me about my thinking and I told him it is like trying to think thru mud. Was this some sort of slap in the face question ? The last time I had a major relapse it cost me 16 + thousand dollars out of my pocket. Long term treatment of Lyme disease is not covered by most insurance companies....some will pay partial. It is like the 80's AIDS epidemic. This advocate should have should have sat me down and talked to me about what I was going to be giving up in backpay.... treatment money, the kid's money, etc. She knew I was in the fog !!! The next morning I woke up thinking I dreamed the whole thing and when I realized it had really happened, I cried my eyeballs out. I tried repeatedly to contact the advocate and could not reach her. I asked to meet with the head of the law firm and he did not want to meet with me. A call back was offered and then the advocate called me instead. The fog in my mind had lifted enough for me to realize what had happened. I told her that she did not speak on my behalf and that I was very upset. Told her I could remember important things and that I either got no answer on , a vague answer, or a very slow response. NEVER understood what the deal was with over 50 because she just kept saying: ""things are going to change after 50."" Let me make this perfectly clear. I may have some brain impairments but I AM NOT BRAIN DEAD ! I told this advocate exactly what I thought went down. What she said in response confirmed EVERYTHING. This lady was not in my corner AT ALL and I am devastated. I am seeking legal counsel at this time. Was told recently by an attorney that the over 50 rule did not even apply in my case. You know my IQ has dropped significantly since the infection but I have ALWAYS been a fighter. Used to be one sharp cookie in the computer tech areas. Brain fog, lack of retention ability, herxheimer reactions from die off of bacteria, nerve pain, loss of smell and taste, etc....the list goes on and on. NOW THIS. My work history is impeccable so why keep my backpay ??? At one point my doctor told me he did not know how I was working. Maybe it is perfectly normal for a judge to want to work out a different date other than the onset date......but this is NOT how things played out !! The judge knew I was confused.....the advocate knew I was confused. My disability was clearly used against me.....and let me add one more thing. When I met with that advocate 2 weeks prior to my court date, I saw the owner of the Law Firm had noted : THIS CASE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WON BY BRAIN SCANS ALONE. If I have failed to provide you with a clear picture of what went down, I am sorry. ",1,0,1,0,0,

None of my asperger's kids were //briliant// (like whatever they show on the big bang theory or whatever) but AFAIK, they've all gone on to live on their own/with friends. What do *you* want to do? Do you have ambitions, if you didn't have the disability? If, say, you went to college, what would you want to study? Find a passion and figure out how to make money off of it. There are jobs where you don't have to interact with people. 

http://www.autism.com/ ARI has employability courses that you can take and great resources about adulthood/jobs - the middle tabs under the picture. Autism Speaks is kind of a scam, imo. Not enough money goes to help actual people with autism. That's a decent starting off point where you can read yourself and not interact with anyone. 

Whatever you do, don't off yourself. There are options out there even though at 16, that's a scary thing to figure out.

When I was sitting in my psychiatrist's office, and he was about to take me off of all anti-anxiety medications, I remembered all the stories from people like you in my online support groups--thank you guys--and decided instead to roll over. 

I just told him how long I'd been with the clinic, how long I'd had an anxiety condition, how many panic attacks I'd had with the medication, and said ""and you just plan on doing... nothing?"" suddenly the medication was getting doubled. (The medication gave me two straight weeks of nightmares, but at least if it does it again there's something to complain about, whereas if he had done nothing, I can't complain about nothing.) 

I reported him to the clinic, am waiting ten days, checking in on that report, then if I don't feel satisfied with what they've done (which I doubt I will) I'm going higher up the chain, focusing on the ""he told me to pick between wellbutrin and effexor without giving me any information on the drugs, telling me they were equivalent drugs."" 

I did just shut the GP down. When he wanted me to go to my old clinic to get a psych eval done. No. Not doing it. Not wasting my time. I need a neurological eval, not a psych. We know what kind of crazy I am. I told the referral lady that and dropped off all of my diagnoses the next day on the official letterhead. 

If I need to see him again, fine. But I'm done with that guy. There is one thing I will not tolerate in a GP, and it's a person that will not listen to me. I've only fired 3 GPs, and it's all for the same reason. (And they're all at the same clinic, which is why I'm leaving the clinic entirely.) Sh was picked by my parents, and wouldn't listen on anything. Also kinda mean. When it came time to approach someone on psych issues, I didn't want to do it with her.

It is kind of painful to think of this right now (ouch heatwave!) but as someone with some similar problems, here's how I deal:

1. Merino. Merino *everything*. OMG. So thin, so light, so warm and snuggly soft.
1a. Including socks. ESPECIALLY socks.
2. A good thin, packable rain shell. Our venerable REI will be happy to help you here :)
3. Pocket handwarmers. Zippo makes an awesome reusable one, or you can get by with disposables.
3a. ...or you can just keep getting a fresh cup of coffee to warm your hands up :)
4. Gloves. Get something a) waterproof, b) lined, and c) either with capacitive fingertips, or grab a bunch of cheap pocketable styluses (styli?) for your phone, so you won't keep yanking them off. If you want gloves, again, REI has a great selection, (I swear they don't pay me for this.) Me, I like something girlier than their options most days though, so I go for the stylus option.
5. Scotchguard^tm. Seriously, I spray the absolute shit out of my jeans.
6. Waterproof footwear. I recommend getting some nice leather boots- something comfy, sturdy, and stylish- and again, just waterproof the absolute shit out of it. But YMMV. If you like a sportier look, again, REI.

Additionally, I don't know if you're a wheelchair user too, but if so... I have an awesome seat pad that is heatable (it's made for outdoor events, like stadium games, but fits just fine on my chair- and I use a 16"" seat. I'll edit with a link if I find one...) Also, I recommend carrying a heavily Scotchguarded lap-blanket and a small towel during the wettest season.

Obviously, I wish the price point was much lower, but I really do think that making this 'just another shoe' is a great way to integrate universal design into the larger market. If this shoe takes off (I really hope it does), it could inspire more shoe companies to make similar products and create an ecosystem in which the universal design principles used to develop shoes are secondary to the incredible designs they reproduce.

Either way, eBay is your friend lol.

$100+ is about the norm for sneakers today. But if you aren't picky about the colors. you can find some great deals on sale, at outlets and online. 

Colorways, model variations and production numbers can have a DRASTIC effect on the price of a sneaker. Take the Reebok Pump Fury for example. Their ""HLS"" variant can be found online in the neighborhood of $50, while their camouflage BAPE variant runs roughly $500 and their ultra limited collaboration with Chanel goes for as much as a decent used car. 

I recommend finding a model you like, maybe trying them on in-store to account for proper sizing and then running that model name through various search engines and ebay and seeing what pops up. You may not be able to find that certain colorway you love at a reasonable price, but unless you're craving a pair of Yeezys, chances are more affordable colorway will turn up somewhere.

I could be totally wrong, but that's what I think it is.

b9d645dd-6c23-4bc6-aea7-902f9562e6af,1437792513,"I'll admit, I can get a bit uncomfortable interacting with people who have severe mental disabilities. I do my best to engage with them and treat them cordially just like I would anyone else, but I'm often running everything I say through my head before I say it to ensure I don't say the wrong thing. I suppose it's not much different than when I'm talking to a cute guy I like, but it's the kind of situation that makes me more nervous than I should be. It has nothing to do with a hierarchy or me thinking I am better then them. It just boils down to my own ineptitude and inexperience in dealing with that kind of person/situation.  It's the same reason I rarely get upset when I can tell someone is noticeably uncomfortable interacting with me due to my disability. It's human nature to get thrown off by things we aren't use to, I understand that. 

In regard to the hierarchy of people with physical disabilities, I try not to think like that (anymore at least). If I did, I'd be going about my life bitter, depressed and feeling less worthy than the countless bipeds that I see on a daily basis, only taking solace in the rare occasion I see someone with a more severe disability. That would be a completely miserable existence. I do feel as though I'm looked down on upon many within the amputee community because I no longer choose to wear a prosthesis. Arm amputees tend to be very understanding, as many I have met don't wear one either. But I can tell the majority of leg amputees and even doctors I have talked to don't respect my choice and view me as some kind of failure or quitter because I prefer crutches. I had an encounter with a recent below knee amputee at a party not long ago and he just couldn't fathom why I ditched my prosthesis, as it had only been a year since the loss of his leg and he was already getting around fine with his. I tried to explain to him I had problems with my hip, wore a prosthesis for 2 years and how it was my preference. But he kept drunkenly rambling on about how it's the 21st century, technological advancements and how ""cyborgs are the future"". I know it was probably coming from a good place but I couldn't help but feel like he was condescending me at the same time. I engaged him for about 20 minutes until he brought up Hugh Herr's bionic legs for what much have been the 5th time and I finally popped off and yelled at him ""DUDE! THEY'RE ******* FEET! NOT LEGS!  YOU AND HUGH STILL HAVE BOTH YOUR ******* KNEES!  IT'S NOT EVEN COMPARABLE!"".  Definitely not one of my finer moments, but I just couldn't take another minute of it. I guess that could be construed as me thinking I was above him in some kind of bizarro hierarchy, not for being less disabled but more-so. I ended up apologizing to him for my outburst later that evening but could tell I threw any potential for a future friendship out the window. 

When it comes to conflicts between those who were born with disabilities and those who acquired them later in their lives. I've been there. I lost my leg at 17 and prior to my injury I was the typical shallow girl in school. Combined with the fact I wasn't able to complete that year of school, when I did go back I was not only an amputee, but also a year older than almost everyone in my classes. I really just expected to get my prosthesis, wear pants and things would just all go back to normal. It took me a while to learn that a lot of my friends weren't really friends when I went from popular to outcast during that time. In addition to the physical challenges I faced, I had to make new (real) friends, learn the difference between being part of the joke or the joke itself and overall change my whole thought process. For a while, I resented both able bodied people and those born into a disability because neither had to suddenly adapt in the ways I did. There was a girl I went to school with who had an underdeveloped hand since birth and I remember being so envious that we were both disabled, but her life had never changed, she still had the same boyfriend since freshman year, the same circle of friends and even though she wasn't the most popular, people generally liked her. It wasn't until I voiced this to a friend that things really started to click for me. He said ""Yeah, but shes always been really nice. No offense, but you can be kinda a *****."". Of course my initial reaction was to go beast mode, cuss him out, but it really gave me something to think about. Even before my injury I was embarrassingly petty, angry and jealous of everyone. My current situation only amplified these negative emotions, while making me a very easy target for people I had wronged in the past. I took my friends comment to heart and while I still have the occasional re-lapse (see story in paragraph above lol), I try to own my disability, be as nice to everyone I come across as possible and never compare my situation to someone elses. Looking back I cant fathom how anyone could have ever bared to be around me when I was like that.

I prefer the wooden handles over the brass or chrome handles because the heavy handle makes it unbalanced. I had one leaning on the wall and a slight bump sent it bouncing and it literally bounced out the door and flipped down the stairs denting itself on the metal stairs and flipped over the rail to crash to the ground as I watched slack jawed with astonishment. It was like watching a marlin beat itself on the deck after its been landed.

A softer wood will dent easier and a harder wood will resist dents but some hard woods like lignum vitae can be brittle. Some like the walking stick store sell them as kits you finish the wood and assemble it and then you can say you made it. I've done several and I use fine sandpaper and then paper sacks to further polish it then put walnut oil on it and polish it again. Reapply the oil every two weeks until it wont absorb more.

9e0a92a9-59e9-4f94-98ae-2e8a3accd178,1436324523,"Yes, we do all learn differently, but for the *majority* of the population, the school system is the best way for them to learn. There will be exceptions, but *most* people will have the best opportunity to learn, improve, and better themselves in the government-run education system. 

The alternative is individual learning plans for each child, and right now that's prohibitively expensive, and teachers are already put under huge amounts of pressure, and they do the best they can. If they see that a child is struggling, there are support systems in place to identify and help resolve any learning difficulties a child is experiencing.

Having a standardised way to measure achievement is vital to know if the system is working. It may not be perfect, but it does the job really well for *most* people. If someone isn't achieving what they should be for their age, it flags up that there's an issue. I'm sure many people with disabilities are only diagnosed due to their interaction with the education system - whether that be educational difficulties or issues with socialising.

[Here's a video by CGP Grey about the idea of a ""Digital Aristotle"".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vsCAM17O-M) He made that two years ago, but I don't think there's been any particular advances since then, sadly.",1,0,1,0,0,

It has never happened to me (or maybe it has and I just don't know about it ha), but if it did it might make me a bit uncomfortable. I'm not really sure, actually. I'd probably want to know they cared about other things too because otherwise it feels like objectification in a sense. I guess it's maybe not that different to me liking red hair and freckles. I mean, my boyfriend has red hair and freckles so that's a nice bonus but that's not why I love him or why I was initially attracted to him. So yeah, if there were other reasons for attraction too maybe I'd be ok with it. But then, I can understand that not everybody (disabled or not) is always looking for a meaningful connection outside of physical attraction. Maybe I'd feel more comfortable with it if that was the case? Dunno, hard to say.

My other problem is that I just keep seeing this scene from the youtube series 'my gimpy life' where the main character (who is disabled) wakes up to find her boyfriend over in the corner, caressing and licking her wheelchair wheels. I'm sure that's not what happens in real life but I'd probably have a little difficulty not constantly laughing at the thought of someone licking my wheels.

1) This penalizing disabled people who work by taking away the benefits they require to function needs to end. It is so unreasonable and I've seen so many people on this subreddit who want to work and are scared to lose the support system they need to get out of bed and have a basic level of human decency. It's a vicious cycle and anyone who has complex needs or expensive needs due to their disability is forever trapped in it.

2) There has to be more acknowledgement of how much harder disabled people have to work to achieve the equivalent to their able-bodied peers. I don't know how to put that into meaningful policy and I know affirmative action is contentious but this needs to be debated and thought about. I went to a talk by Tom Shakespeare (he's a researcher in the UK) and he was talking about employment of disabled people. He said something along the lines of ""If you have two candidates  in front of you who are exactly the same in terms of achievements and qualifications then you should always always always pick the disabled candidate because they've had to work 2, 3, 4, 5 times as hard as the able-bodied person to get to where they are and that says something about them"". I'm not saying that's what we should do, I myself have mixed feelings about affirmative action. However, my own experience tells me that I have indeed had to work harder to get where I am than my friends in the same field as me. Few people acknowledge this, a lot of people simply aren't tuned into this and genuinely think that the disabled people who do well have had free passes or special favors or whatever. I've had people write me references and explicitly have to write that I've had no special favors to get where I am. The fact that they have to write that in my reference says a lot about what perceptions are.
Anyway, my point is that we need a better system than what we have now. It's just not good enough. I don't know whether the answer is to focus on education, perhaps more scholarships for the disabled to get us better qualifications and set us up at a better starting point? Perhaps better legislation to protect us in work? I'd really like to hear other viewpoints on this one because I honestly don't know how to even begin to tackle something so ingrained.",5,0,5,0,0,

I don't think there is necessarily a hierarchy but there is definitely internal prejudices. Because ""disability"" encompasses such a wide variety of conditions it is inevitable. People with disabilities are just as likely to have preconceived notions about others. Neurotypical people, even those with significant physical disabilities, are likely to not know how to interact appropriately with people with IDD or ASDs and as such, they carry those preconceived notions. There is also a certain amount of identity many of us take from our disabilities. Someone with significant disabilities (say muscular dystrophy) might view someone with learning disorders as not disabled ""enough"" and so on. There are a million reasons why people behave poorly towards one another.  

For example, the gentleman you mentioned with CP that doesn't like interacting with people with IDD or people with ASD. It could be because, as a person with CP, he is mistakenly identified as having those conditions and so he distances himself from them OR maybe someone was stimming and knocked into him one time OR maybe he's just an asshole. 

In the instances of people acquiring disabilities vs. being born with them, you can find that people will have wildly different relationship with their disabilities. Someone who was born blind or deaf (as opposed to someone who acquires blindness or deafness later) may not necessarily view the condition as having something taken from them. The Deaf community is very strong and those who acquire deafness can have a hard time ""breaking in"" as it takes a long time to become really fluent in ASL and understand the nuances in Deaf communication standards.

Due to my mobility issues and med side effects, I have gained a lot of extra weight. I went from a fit, athletic 125 lbs to 250lbs. My confidence in my appearance has taken a hit, but I'm still confident about me overall. I'm smart, funny, and a genuinely decent kind of person. I'm a writer and an artist. I have a lot to offer.

You can appeal an ALJ decision. However, if you received a ""fully favorable"" decision then that is the best outcome you could have had (as opposed to a partially favorable decision). You can try to still appeal to the Appeals Council level but they typically just affirm the ALJ decision. You can then do a federal appeal but that takes years to process and I am doubting you will find a laywer who is going to take your case that far.

Section 7. [**Voluntary trepanation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trepanning#Voluntary_trepanation) of article  [**Trepanning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trepanning): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;Although regarded as [pseudoscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience) by the mainstream medical community, the practice of trepanation for other claimed medical benefits continues. Moreover, some proponents   point to recent research [*[where?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias)*] on the increase in cranial compliance following on trepanation, with resulting increase in blood flow,  as providing some justification for the practice. Individuals have practiced non-emergency trepanation for psychic purposes. A prominent proponent of the modern view is Peter Halvorson, who drilled a hole in the front of his own skull to increase ""brain blood volume"".

Nike is a brand name that the general public thinks is cool and has the cache to charge a higher price for that reason. By marketing these in the same way (and for a similar cost) as they would any other shoe, Nike tells consumers that this IS just like any other designer shoe they sell and is meant to appeal to everyone, not just those with disabilities. This works to promote a marketplace in which universally accessible designs are part of the norm and can be high-end products in their own right instead of a sub market meant to appeal solely to (and effectively differentiate in an ultimately negative way) those with disabilities. 

It reflects a trend in glasses, which I think is ultimately a good thing. After all, the most inclusive designs are those that work well for disabled persons but are cool enough for everyone else to want as well.

The mere fact that his name is attached to these shoes means they will cost more than their more generic entry level models. 

Usually I would say don't buy them, but this case is rather conflicting. If people don't buy them, Nike sees no market, other brands see no market and the likelihood of anyone producing more shoes like is is greatly reduced. If people do buy at the stated price-point, then Nike sees a market, but in typical Nike fashion... they hike up the prices. 

The best case and most likely scenario IMO, is these sell well and other brands take note. Nikes are usually priced higher than the competition, so if Puma, Reebok, etc. see these are selling, they will likely manufacture their own variations on the idea at a lower price-point. Considering LeBrons name is attached to the shoe, I presume they will sell rather well. Not only to those in need of this kind of shoe, but the average consumer as well. Lots of people like Nikes, lots of people like Lebron and lots of people like bells and whistles on their shoes. Even though these were created with people with CP in mind, I can see the combination of their laceless design, sippers and velcro straps being enticing to anyone who simply likes fancy sneakers. 

I suppose if enough people were to petition or write Nike, and they saw a market, they may be inclined to release more shoes in a similar vein at a lower price-point, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Nikes prices seem to skyrocket every few years with no rhyme or reason. My favorite model, the Presto Classic, just re-released at $130, when just a few years ago they retailed at $79. Irks the hell out of me, especially now that I only require a single shoe so I'm basically throwing $65 away for nothing. But what can I say, I still bought them anyway lol.

I think you have excellently described the paradox that we find ourselves in.  The way the system is set up, there is not enough support for those with disabilities-it is evident through the economic disparity, college entrance rates, and about a billion factors that show the oppression of those with disabilities is alive and well even though people with disabilities do have to work exceptionally harder than their able-bodied counter parts.  I do agree that education is a big factor in this economic disparity.  Not only is attending class regularly difficult for some people with disabilities, but receiving socialization that promotes learning is even difficult.  This is definitely something that needs to be addressed in this next U.S. election cycle.

The year before that, they'd offered me $760. It's all, as you know, based on how much your salary was in the quarters leading up to your quitting work.

Both circumstances and a person's basic propensity to be happy or optimistic or the opposite can play into the way they see things.

Autism is a spectrum of functionality just like physical disability can be. If you can feed yourself, bathe yourself, or walk on on your own, you're doing way better than anyone put into a mental institution or group home and definitely don't belong in one.

I know that 'normies' suck. Anyone different from them is immediately 'the cripple' or 'the disabled person'. The truth is, most of them don't know how to treat you. People grow up learning how to treat their peers, their elders, and little kids... but being 'different' throws a wrench into that. Kids react with avoidance or bullying, adults react by treating you like a child. You have to speak up and tell them what they're doing is wrong. They can't telepathically know how you want to be treated, YOU set that standard.

Most importantly, you can't judge yourself by normal standards. You are you. You are only as ugly or disgusting as you think yourself to be. Who cares what other people think! All those high school kids will forget you the second they get into college. The only people are should matter are the people that DO like you and don't mind any of your weird quirks. You might not know any of those people yet, but they're out there, waiting to meet you. You can't just go 'I hate people and people hate me' because that's quitter talk. That's giving up on meeting those people and giving up on making the most of life.

Disability just means you're different. You have to get through life creatively. It's a challenge for you to make the most of. Never believe you can't get a job or do something with your life. It'll be harder, but it just makes it more rewarding when you do it.

The ""system"" probably doesn't help much either. For example, the disability services at my university often gets swamped during exam-week simply because there are not enough readers, scribes, or individual test rooms. So some students, such as myself and my blind friend, get priority over students with dyslexia or other learning disorders. You may argue that this is because ""we are more disabled"" (because that is part of it), but it's also because there is NO way I could pass an exam without a scribe. But with a scribe, I can ace it.  


As for conflicts between those disabled since birth (or a very young age) vs a disability acquired later, I haven't seen/experienced this much, but I can see how there could be issues. On one hand a disability acquired later means that a person got to experience ""normal life"" then had to adapt to becoming disabled. But those (like me) who have been disabled since birth have never had to ""learn to be disabled""; our challenges, and how to deal with them, have been engrained with us our entire lives. Does that make me a better, ""more adaptive"" disabled person than the guy who was paralyzed at 25? No, but I would like to think so since he got 25 years of being normal. 

Is this all very petty? Yes, but it happens. ",8,0,8,0,0,

It could also be to educate people on how disabled people play games despite disability. Education I think should take importance over just inspiring. 

I think it's a solid idea, and of course some people might be picky about disabled people being 'inspirational' but I say go for it. I'm disabled and even I need to learn more about how people adapt to play games or sports.

I play adaptive sports: sled hockey, cycling, wheelchair racing. Learning about the equipment involved is a task in itself sometimes. This could be a great place for people to see how it works.

I think you definitely need to let him know it is upsetting to not have control over your own body and how the way he handles things feels unsupportive and adds to the upset. Him dropping you would likely not have been as emotionally upsetting if he had apologized and together, you had brainstormed where it went wrong in order to decrease the likelihood it happened again. Instead, you basically got reprimanded. 

Be sure to make it known how much you appreciate his help and that you know it isn't easy/frustration-free for him either. I would probably lead with this. Be sure to ask (with the intention of being open and willing to learn) anything you do that may make helping you a challenge or things you could do to make it easier for him. For example, my husband found it really challenging when I wouldn't vocalize how my symptoms were on any given day, but would become upset if he asked too much of me. This wasn't fair to him -- he isn't psychic and I have an invisible illness. 

Prior to you not having use of your arms, did he tend to respect your wishes? Were you a team when approaching challenges? The reason I ask is I am wondering if this dynamic was there before, but just wasn't as obvious.

I cannot tell for sure from your post, but it seems possible he is treating you like a child. When my child (almost 6) is complaining about something that needs to get done, I am sorry to say, I am guilty of not always listening to her when I should. I think I know better and/or just want to get the task over with. However, I never do the same to my husband. If she asked me to use a different cup to rinse her hair after I'd already started, I would ignore the request. If I were in a situation where I was bathing my husband, I would switch cups out of respect, despite thinking it was silly. If she says she wanted a different bowl for her food -- nope. Husband -- yep, because I know there's a good reason beyond not being in the mood for a red bowl.

How long will you require his assistance for? If it is going to be for awhile, would the two of you be open to going to a therapist to have someone help?

You could try pool noodles. When you're on your own side/defending you can use it to tag people (maybe even by throwing the pool noodle). When you're on the other side/attacking you could use it as a temporary stun. So if you cross into enemy territory, one of the opposing team members comes up, and you hit them with the pool noodle before they tag you, they become ""stunned"" for 10 seconds and can't tag anyone (this number might need to be tweaked). After 15 seconds they can try and tag you again or can go after other players.

That got a laugh out of me!

Julie Zeilinger created Fbomb--a feminist website dedicated to teenage girls, and props to her for that. I call her work ""cookie-cutter feminism"" in a previous comment on this thread because it simply repackages the same points made various places in the online feminist community: it's eerie to me how consistent their talking points are nowadays, and it cuts too close to political performance art for my taste. I don't like their language, I find it combative and insensitive, and it just seems inauthentic to me. It feels like they're writing what they think their audience wants to hear, and that ableism is just the flavor of the month among some feminists.

It seems to me accessibility and inclusion are far more important than cataloguing forms of ableism. People's limitations are frequently invisible to the point of incomprehensibility to others. I think our responsibility is to make our experiences accessible to others in order that they might find their way to help our community in ways consistent with their values. I find most people want to help: no sense in driving them away with six admonishments that really don't give abled folks much more than fodder for awkward conversations with limited folks.

When I get asked about ableism, I immediately steer the discussion to what my limitations are and how I cope with them. Most people find our coping skills extremely helpful.

Disabled? More like patience ninjas (well, on good days anyhow).

The book [*Eat Well, Live Well with Spinal Cord Injury*](http://www.pva.org/atf/cf/%7BCA2A0FFB-6859-4BC1-BC96-6B57F57F0391%7D/Eat%20Well%20Live%20Well%20with%20Spinal%20Cord%20Injury.pdf) also has a chapter on nutrition for weight loss that you may find useful. Again, it's SCI focused so not everything is directly applicable, but food should be the same. 

Anyways, I hope that something there helps!

I think it's a shame that there is so much stigma surrounding being attracted to the disabled. The close-mindedness that the disabled have about devs magnifies the way many are not nearly well adjusted enough to date. They haven't accepted that their differently abled bodies are worthy of love just the way they are. I dated a dev and it was the most eye opening experience of my life. I'm in love with the idea that my intricacies are an asset! What more could I possible ask for? ,5,0,5,0,0,

That size bra is extremely hard to find, and you will likely end up ordering it online, but make sure the sizing is correct, and see if you can try on different styles in a store to see if she can at least get them on/off herself even if it's not the proper size.  I agree that either a front-clasp or pullover style would probably be easiest.  As for the shoulder slope, perhaps a raceback style, or one with adjustable straps that you could cross in the back?  That should keep the strap from sliding down on the affected side.  Depending on how flexible she is, she may also be able to use a strap clip, attaching it near the back of her neck, then sliding it down a few inches.",2,0,2,0,0,
169ab21f-4dd0-45b0-828e-7ff9b03992bc,1435758388,"Hi there - I feel pretty qualified to answer this question. I'm a person with a disability and I specifically went to law school so I could do disability advocacy. Thankfully, I now get paid to work at a national level on policy and programs I love. That said, DO NOT go to law school if you don't want to practice law. Actually, check that, DO NOT go into lots of debt attending law school unless you have a passion for the law. While I am a lawyer, I don't actually litigate and I probably could have made it to where I'm at through a less intensive and cheaper masters program. My legal background is helpful in regards to understanding the law and regulations relevant to disability but the real reason I am where I am is that I interned with great disability organizations, volunteered a ton and was eventually elected to lead a national student group while I was in school. Like most career fields, connections and experience will get you farther than just a degree.   

My advice is to get volunteer experience with local disability advocacy groups such as your state Protection and Advocacy group or a city disability/diversity committee. Doing so will allow you to gain a better idea of what academic background would benefit you most for what you specifically want to do, get great advice from people in the field and allow you to develop local connections. Most P&amp;As have a mix of lawyers, policy wonks, fundraisers and professional advocates. If and when you decide on a graduate program - look into doing volunteer work with student groups, campus diversity/disability/accessibility committees.  

I don't want to dissuade you specifically from law school but the trick is knowing precisely what you want to do and achieve within disability rights. For example, I am a policy wonk and work on getting large scale policies and programs benefiting people with disabilities in place. I'm good at it. I'm also good at outreach and consensus building. But there are plenty of things I'm not great at. I can't help individuals get disability benefits or walk them through the process of applying for other various benefits programs. There are disability lawyers that are the complete opposite of me and help tons of individuals while never going into bigger policy work. Finding out what you want to do before choosing a graduate program will save you lots of headache.   ",3,0,3,0,0,

You're going to want to find an online calculator to calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR). Your BMR is the amount of calories you would burn in a day if you were totally inactive. From there, you can increase that number if you are active on a given day.





Next, design your diet around the amount of calories you burn in a day. Generally speaking, a deficit of 3500 calories will result in a lost pound. So a daily deficit of 500 calories will lose you a pound per week, theoretically. ",5,0,5,0,0,
