4a3524e4-b828-4c0e-90f6-8d27ddbe93a0,1424827149,"This might be a little too simplistic for you but I've been wondering about some sort of retractable belt clip for a walking stick. 

Controlling a stick can be surprisingly complex. There are loads of reasons why you might want to put it down for a minute but keep it close at hand (it usually involves needing two hands for a while). Finding somewhere to rest it can be a gamble - think standing at a urinal; where would you rest it (especially if the corner is taken)? What if it falls and slides gently to the floor? What would it land in? Would you really like to have to pick it up and keep using it? Plus, remember why you're using the stick in the first place, could you actually manage to bend down to pick it up? Would someone else get it for you (see point about what else might be down there)? 

I used to have a magnetic thing. It came with a magnet that attached to the stick and a metal clip that went on your belt. It did work, you could ""stick"" the stick to your belt, but of course the clip was always on your ""other"" belt! Its one good use was that you could stick the stick to the car whilst unloading the supermarket trolley. 

I'm sure the design could be improved. I had wondered about a more robust version of those retractable key chains. The ones with the spring that allow you to pull the key away from your pocket to unlock the door but then pulls the wire/chain/string back so that the key hangs from your belt. If it attached to the stick and clipped to your belt, it would be harder to forget. 

It would need to be strong but lightweight, balanced so as not to interfere with using the stick but not get tangled round your legs if you dropped it. It would need to be secure on the stick, my magnet used to slip. 

Hopefully you get the idea - hint:I gave up on the magnet. Make something better and let me help you test it! ",3,0,3,0,0,

There is rarely anyone else at the bus stop. I have to have a carer with me and I've tried to hide while she flags down the bus but due to the setup of the stops, they see me anyway and just drive by. The buses are once an hour so if I miss one then I'm screwed.

I've tried the arguing with the mothers/driver thing multiple times before, I point out that they can take the child out of their pushchair, fold it up and stow it while I'm incapable of getting out of my chair. A few people will move, especially if others on the bus shame them but it seems that most are unwilling to intervene. 

The parents don't care and neither do the drivers. I've literally been kicked off for ""causing a scene"" when trying to fight for my right to the wheelchair spot.

I've complained to the company that runs the bus but they just say that they can't force someone to move if they're there first. A recent lawsuit agrees. The mother wins!

People in my area don't seem to see disabled people on a regular basis and because it's a poor area they see me as ""scrounging scum"" so they refuse to move.

I was attacked by four huge guys when I asked them to move their van that was blocking the entire pavement as well as the only dropped kerb with another dropped kerb opposite. All I wanted was to cross the road and they tried to push my chair into traffic (thank god I'm in a heavy powerchair, the clutch and weight meant they couldn't move me). 

They were screaming abuse at me, calling me a scrounger, telling me I should be ""put down"", that I was a waste of oxygen, that I'm too young to be disabled and I'm just doing it for the money (I don't even claim benefits, lol). 

When they tried to kick my (then) 13 week old puppy I flipped. I grabbed my phone and started to dial 999, telling them that they'd not only broken the law by parking in such a way as to block the entire pavement and the dropped kerb but that they'd also committed a hate crime. 

They panicked, jumped in the van and took off (before I could think to take their number plate, unfortunately). 

The funny thing is that I was bluffing. I'm deaf and lipread, I couldn't have called the police no matter how much I wanted to. I was just fortunate that the bluff scared them off.

My saviour was a food processor and soupmaker. I love soup and was given my soupmaker, but if you're buying yourself I'd go for a crockpot/slow cooker before a soupmaker as you'll get more variety from it, although it won't blend like a soupmaker does and will be a lot slower. My soupmaker does a blended soup in 20 minutes which is pretty amazing.

With the processor you just turn it on and whack things in. Mine has a variety of slicing attachments which come in different sizes and shapes, it grates, mixes, grinds and probably some other things I don't know about. The disks are blunt around the edge so no danger of cutting yourself when swapping out either. Easy to clean, just rinse after cutting then a quick wipe round with a soapy cloth after. Emergency cutout so it doesn't blow up if you have a fit while using it. Zero danger to your hands. I buy my 'meat' (vegetarian) ready chopped and I'd imagine if that exists for vegetarians there must be pre-chopped meat out there. You can also buy bags of pre-cut salad, but personally I just tear the lettuce by hand, process the cucumber/carrot and add other leaves like rocket and spinach which are in small pieces anyway.

Once chopped you just transfer stuff to your slow cooker/soupmaker, set the timer and ignore. You can make so many things in a slow cooker. Soups, stews, cassaroles, curry, roast, pizza, desserts...the list goes on and on. /r/slowcooking has some great ideas. The only dangerous part of this whole process is ladling out hot food which your bf could always do when he gets home. 

I also use a microwave for things like baked potatoes, rice, some egg dishes, fish, steamed veg, couscous, and most importantly, cake. These could also be made as an accompaniment to whatever's in the slow cooker. And it's the same deal, cut in processor, bun in microwave, set timer, walk away. Easy as pie. ",2,0,2,0,0,

I'll try to address some of your questions really quickly. Disabilities Studies (DS) is a relatively new form of Critical Theory that tries to change the way we view disabilities in society.

&gt;What is the problem with normalization of people in SPED?

The problem is that from that mindset, society sees a ""disability"" as something that needs to be ""fixed"" or ""overcome."" For many things like LD, BD, or even ED, it simply means that your brain is wired differently. You are just as capable of learning as anyone else is, but you do it differently. 

Traditional SPED does not look at the way these people learn, and try to accommodate them. It sees where they are ""not normal"" and tries to fix it. I would argue that there is no such thing as ""normal"" and we should stop trying to fit these people into the box. We just need to get a new, more accommodating box.

&gt;What possible problem can be seen in empowering people to lead more capable lives?

Nothing at all. The problem is that's not what Special Education does. SPED takes a student, finds out what's ""wrong"" with them, and then tries to find ways to ""overcome"" this ""problems."" The best example I can give is what the Deaf community has done at large. Hearing aids and implants have recently become fairly advanced. However, much of the Deaf community would scoff at the idea of getting one of them. They are insulting. The very fact of their existence implies that there is something ""wrong"" with being Deaf. In many ways, getting a hearing implant is like throwing away a part of your identity. Students with LD are equally broken down in school. They are constantly reminded of their deficits at every annual IEP meeting. Every single annual goal is based on an area where they are struggling. None of them focus on their strengths.

RTI might change the way Special Education referrals happen, but for the most part, people are referred to Special Education because they see something ""wrong"" with them. In many cases this becomes a reason to separate the student from the general education classroom. Today, Special Education is the ONLY socially acceptable form of segregation in schools. 70 years ago, the exact same reasons people support separate race schools are the exact same reasons people support SPED classes today. A belief in inferiority.

&gt;Someone with Downs or Prader Willi or a severe learning disability or an amputee who was injured in the war did not work themselves into their disability through bad choices, and they do not have the option to work their way out of their disability.

Right, and I would argue that those people don't have anything to ""work out"" of. That's just who they are.  The only reason people see them as inferior in anyway is because they are trying to ""normalize"" them. If there is a guy that had his arm blown off by an IUD, whatever, he doesn't need to just live his whole life trying to make up for his lost arm, he just needs to accept that it may be part of his identity now. Not a negative, not a positive, it's just part of his being. It's just how you view yourself.

&gt;they do not have the opportunity the obese have to actually remove their disability through their own actions. 

I don't deny that. But from a Disability Studies standpoint, I would argue that that is irrelevant. I agree that they CAN change themselves, but what obligation do they have to? Some would say it's healthy, but then I ask what obligation do they have to be healthy? In the same way the Deaf choose to remain Deaf, can't the obese choose to remain obese? 

&gt;The idea that these people would not take these steps is offensive. It seems like you might disagree.

Yes, I would disagree. Granted, I certainly don't disagree in the process of being healthy. I believe in being healthy. I avoid sugar, and hit the gym on a regular basis. But I don't find it ""offensive"" that others don't do the same. In fact, I find it offensive when people try to force health on others as a moral obligation. I would also argue that it's wrong to stop people from doing drugs or other actions that may be self-damaging, and I have no right to tell them how to live their lives.

&gt;why do you feel people should be able to make themselves unhealthy via lifestyle choices then be catered to?

I don't know if I agree with the last part. I don't think they should be ""catered to"" anymore than anyone else. I personally don't have an issue with airlines making the obese buy extra seats, as they use the extra space. I don't really want to address handicapped placards, as I feel that system is already kind of flawed. Any government enforced model will be flawed. It really should be a ""hey, if you think you need the handicapped parking, take it, but don't be dick"" kind of model. Maybe that's a bit lofty, but that's what I think.

I also think this might be a different issue in a country with Universal Healthcare, like Canada. But in a country like the USA, that supposedly champions individuality, (myself included, which might make me a bit different from other scholars of Critical Theory), I think people should be able to be as obese as they want with no consequence.",1,0,1,0,0,

Tell them what's been happening and they will give you more time to get the reports. And unfortunately ,I know of no way to hold the insurance company responsible. If SSA denies your claim appeal the decision, SSA will tell you how in the denial letter. They will also tell you what documentation they received so you'll know if they got everything you want them to conceder.  FYI,most folks get denied on their first application for this very reason. Hope this helps, good luck. PS; don't count on SSA for medical testing, I don't trust their Dir.'s. Just saying. ",1,0,1,0,0,

My son is considered severely and multiply disabled and had a text book sized stack of original medical documentation proving his disability so his approval was fast tracked, compassionate allowance or what ever you want to call it.   He got a letter from SSA giving him approval for Medicaid purposes same day as the in person SSA interview.  It took another month before a doctor reviewed his medical documentation and when that was approved his benefits started and we got backpay from the initial phone contact date.   My son is one of only two cases I know of that went this smoothly and the other child was just as severely disabled as he was so I am less clear about how long it will take for other levels of disability where they may decide to investigate more.

I hated being ""worked"" with and I especially resented when I was pushed to do things that felt physically exhausting. There may be an element of this with your son, he maybe sees these things are inconveniences he has to do before he can get back to doing what he wants to do.

Now that I'm older, I realized that my parents had to be really really crafty to get me to do the things I was supposed to do. 

- Wheelchair? They made picking out the wheelchair colour a really big deal, made me feel like I was an adult. Then, told me we could go to the bookshop and I could buy whatever stickers I wanted so that I could decorate it however I liked. Incidentally, I chose to have ""watch out, tinystormcloud's about!"" stuck on the back of the chair. I felt really fucking cool and then I wanted to use it all the damn time. They called me speedy gonzales, which only made me want to use it more.

- Wanted me to exercise my breathing but I didn't like blowing into the special blowy machines they gave me in  hospital? Somehow they convinced me I was into playing the recorder. Lots of recorder lessons. Got me into singing too. My mum would sing with me all the time, turn up the music in the car on the way to school and have an all out sing-a-long. I joined the choir in school later on because that's how much I thought I was into singing. I have a terrible voice.

- Hated physio? They convinced me I would love swimming in a heated pool in the winter. Took me two, three times a week. We had competitions to see who could blow bubbles for longest (breathing exercises but I didn't know it!). Parents pretended she wanted to exercise by doing lengths up and down the pool, if I wanted to do the fun stuff then I had to make sure I kept up and I'd get rewarded at the end of each length. After swimming? I got to have a toastie or a hot chocolate. This wasn't explicitly said so I never thought I was doing it for a reward, I was just always casually given the treat. 

- Need to exercise my hands and fine motor skills? Parents got me a playstation 1 with a racing car game and a steering wheel that plugged in. They also got me one of those platform games so I could practice using my fingers on the buttons.

Don't know if any of these are useful, obviously your son's disability is different to mine but I guess my point is that you may need to use some trickery. I was a particularly difficult child with stuff like this and only recently my parents revealed how many of the things I did as a child were proxies for exercise or to improve posture or breathing or whatever. In retrospect, I'm really grateful they made such a difficult childhood so much fun.

I hope today is treating you better than yesterday. 
I'm sorry you are in such a hell. 
Constant suicidal ideation can be so exhausting and just sucks at creativity and our ability to relate well to people who don't understand what that's like.. So I can relate to wanting to be able to continue the coping tools you have for those feelings. In fact, it's awesome that you know some things that help you. 

So I am replying to this comment instead of your OP because you mention your hesitancy regarding signing up for something you don't really understand (Medicaid in this instance). 
I do NOT say this to discourage you, but applying for disability is intensive as fuck and totally complicated. It takes a ton of time and energy, and in order to receive what is called a 'Fully Favorable Decision', you will need to have basically exhausted your treatment options so that the examiners are able to document that you are still disabled. Many people apply when they are ill but under treated. Because they could potentially be better with treatment, their disability claims are denied. 
Of course this doesn't mean that you are not a candidate for disability insurance- it means that you MIGHT not be a candidate YET. 
It is great that you have been seeing a doctor about the snow, but you will want to get the secondary depression with suicidal ideation treated and obtain all of your records from each doctor you see before you go to apply for disability. 

You mention not being able to afford the visits to a psychiatrist and a psychologist or LMSW. I've so been there and it sucks. But these appointments (and a series of them, usually) are not only usually necessary for disability approval, they can change your life completely. There have been some incredible advances in the field of behavioral therapy that can make a gigantic difference for people with physical symptoms that decrease their quality of life to the point of suicidal behavior. Brains are pretty amazing and quite trainable. Even if the snow is not something that can be fixed, you can train your brain to be okay with that on some level and regain a sense of hope, happiness, etc. There are also some cool things being done with the under-researched field of biofeedback. 

Medicaid or whatever county version is offered near you could be an excellent option. It sounds as though you are currently insurance-less, or do you just have a super high deductible? Medicaid is there for people with low to no income as way to obtain affordable healthcare and you should not feel ashamed to use it to get back on your feet. What if you could go through a year or three of treatment on Medicaid and then feel well enough to return to work full time and give back to the same system in that way? And even if you can't go back to work, what if you could just be HAPPY again? Believe it or not, it is possible to be happy while also in severe discomfort. I have an intractable pain condition and it's amazing how much more awesome life is once we retrain our brains not to focus on hell all of the time. 
If you want to find out more about Medicaid and other available supports while you are trying to get healthy, you can do some preliminary research online but might prefer to head over to your local Department of Human Services. They can walk you right through the process and answer any questions you might have. 

After establishing better, affordable treatment, you may still find that you are simply unable to work. If that is the case, it would be a good time to consider applying for Social Security Disability. 
You can apply online, but I have found the process can be better expedited by bringing your medical records, work history, and social security # to a set appointment at your local social security office. They can help you determine if you meet the basic criterion for qualification, such as having worked for long enough in the instance of SSDI or if you meet the maximum asset requirements in the instance of SSI. They are two different programs and more info can be found on the SSA website but if there is anything I can answer for you as a layperson who has successfully received SSDI without the use of an attorney, ask away. 

I think it is great that you are looking into this. Luckily, you have a lot of options to make your life more secure and pleasant at this point. They might not be ideal options, but they are there to be used by those who need them. 

Please feel free to contact me with any questions or to vent at anytime. 
 Also that we voted these programs into existence and pay taxes to sustain them. There is no reason to feel ashamed for looking into things like Medicaid and food stamps in order to get healthy and back on your feet. 

I made you a kind of cheat-sheet. Of course you can go about this anyway that works best for you, but this was successful for me :)

-I would start by getting Medicaid or other affordable and good insurance. 

-see a psychiatrist for diagnosis/medical treatment and a psychologist or LMSW for any prescribed therapy and for a place to build tools for managing your complex conditions (these are not tools we gained naturally)..

-focus on getting better 

-obtain all medical records and direct getting your own best treatment. If you don't like a dr or therapist, switch. If you have questions about a possible treatment, ask. If you are experiencing w change in any aspect of your conditions, bring it up. 

-If you are still unable to work after you have gone through significant treatment, ask your therapist and dr about whether they believe you would be a candidate for disability. If they say 'yes', ask them for a testimonial letter (hit me up if you want more explanation).

-If you have gone through extensive treatment and are still unable to work, apply for disability armed with testimonials and treatment records as well as work history. 

-be prepared for a long wait and lots of paperwork. Most people are NOT approved immediately. I had to wait almost three years to get approved. My case was approved after part of a hearing in a sort of unusual fashion. You will need to have a source of income -even if you physically cannot work whatsoever- while you are waiting for approval or denial. I don't say this to discourage you but instead so you can plan :) If you need ideas here, this sub is a hotbed.

-build support systems. It is hard to feel validated, understood, okay- when we are living in our own heads. Also good friends and family WANT to help if you need them. They may have limits to how they can help, but it sure helps to be able to move in with someone if you are in a temporary tight situation, or to have someone you can vent to :)

I like the grip, it flairs out allowing my thumb/ the part that connects my thumb to my hand to put direct pressure on the crutch. Otherwise there is nothing really ecstatic about them. The rest is just a typical crutch. That being said my crutches are primarily used for lateral stability while moving, they really are not about helping me move forward, just keep me upright, and stop me from going side to side a lot.

Stability is no big deal outside of ice, but I just adjust by keeping my stride smaller and my crutches closer to my side, it keeps my center of balance and center of gravity aligned.

The one problem I have is the cuff on top. Now I'm sure you are supposed to take your arm out by lifting it out of the crutch, but lets be honest, most of the time I am pulling my arm out the middle slat because I can, it is more efficient, and above all I am lazy. Because of that the cuffs widen, and eventually start to slip off my arm when I am using my arms for other things. So if you guys could make the plastic more spring like/ resilient that would be great.

 Other than that, I have found that most tips suck, in fact all pure rubber tips I have used get cut up from the inside, the crutch itself pushes through, all the tips I use have what appears to be a metal ring where the crutch meets the inside of the tip, followed by what I think is a variant of ballistics gel (st least that's what it looks like) to absorb the downward force, and not puncture the tip from the inside.",2,0,2,0,0,

What you are referring to is the Continuing Disability Review (CDR) process. 

It's not so much that you will be reviewed to see if you 'get it again'. It's more that we are doing a medical review to see that you remain disabled.

This distinction is important as the thresholds are different for an initial claim (which I assume you just finished up with). While initially we must prove you disabled to SSA's definition of disability, during a CDR we must simply prove there has been *no significant medical improvement* since your initial claim. 

Like others said, keep a record of the doctors you see. This doesn't need to be detailed, just the dates seen and their name, address and phone number. 

Also, as your award letter stated your review will be in five to seven years, your claim is likely one we don't expect there to be medical improvement on, else your letter would have said three years. In these cases (we call them MINE cases - Medical Improvement Not Expected), our threshold is even lower - we can often times determine there has been no medical improvement off of your statements alone, sometimes without any current medical evidence, even.

TL;DR: Don't ignore the paperwork sent to you when you come up for review (CDR) and you will most likely be fine. 
Please do note that your claim may not be a MINE case - I cannot speak any more specifically to your situation.",2,0,2,0,0,

One example we use in trainings is that a person having an assistance animal in a no pets complex is a reasonable accommodation, but asking management to send someone from the staff down to the unit 3 or 4 times a day to walk the dog would not be reasonable because it would be a ""fundamental alteration"" -- it's not something the housing provider does. 

We tend to see the same sets of reasonable accommodation requests: assistance animals in no pets complexes and assigned parking spaces close to the unit. We also see a lot of people being evicted for disability-related behaviors. We usually try to get them more time, if necessary, to move out or to maybe prove that a new treatment plan will change the behaviors. 

As for non-traditional accommodations, the best example I have is listed in another answer: We heard about someone long ago who slammed a baseball bat into the apartment walls as a manifestation of a mental disability. The client get a Nerf bat, which stopped the damage, stopped the noise, and worked just as well for the client.

1. My medication costs as much as my rent, and I can only afford one on my wage, Guess which one I need most.
2. I wont have a wage for much longer because I'm getting worse and can't continue to work.
3. My condition is not accepted as a disability in my country and I can not access a pension I have no idea where I will get an income from. I don't want to live off a pension the rest of my life either, I want to work.
4. I'm studying so that I can hopefully get work as a medical transcriber, But I'm having so many bad days I'm missing a lot, Content wise I'm doing well, But there is mandatory attendance and I may fail on that alone. If I do I wont be able to afford to re-enroll and try again.


My second biggest worry is social stigma. My disability is invisible.

1. I had to take the train yesterday, It was crowded and though I asked for a seat I was ignored. It was a painful and tiring journey to stand, and it effected my capacity the rest of the day.
2. I set aside this morning to rest and recover from a long day yesterday, I woke up at midday, I worked until 11pm last night so I didn't feel too bad, But My landlord gave me the dirtiest look as I walked to the shower, I felt 2 inches tall.
3. I got a migraine aura in class, I told my teacher that I am leaving now to avoid having a full blown migraine while riding home. While I am an adult and I can leave no matter what she says, she was very condescending and told me I can't just give up when I start ""getting a headache"".

And a person with superhuman speed might or might not get paid more, but I would say they would probably be up for a raise quicker than the guy coming in distracted. 

There are jobs for people with disabilities (though not near enough, I know). Personally, we have a section in our sheltered workshop that they run a recycling facility, where the employees will take donated or recyclable items, and re-sell them on Ebay. It is a totally awesome thing, that they run independently.  I think that should absolutely be the focus, and spend more time/funds finding jobs that utilize individual's actual talents.

But some of my clients have severe/profound developmental disabilities, with and without behavioral obstacles too.  They need someone who is trained how to redirect them if they are starting to get too upset/violent, or maybe they do things socially unacceptable like masturbating in public.  It is highly unlikely there are enough jobs  that are going to be able to utilize their talents in a typical work environment, without a 1:1 trained staff member.  Now I would LOVE if all of my clients had community jobs, but some of them really excel in the workshops and would not excel outside of it.  

And really, it's not just sheltered workshops that work like that. For example, an artist.  Say an artist get's paid $100 to paint a mural on a wall. Whether it takes her 100 hours, or 5 hours to finish that mural, her take-home dollar will be the same.

I saved Stella's TED talk after the first time I saw it and showed it to many people in my life, as even those that I'd sort of expect to understand that I'm not ""amazing"" just because I'm not dead yet, well, they don't understand at all.

My husband, my in-laws, my carers, all have at some point objectified me in the way Stella spoke of. My father in law said to my husband ""I used to complain about stupid things until I met [me] but having seen the things she has to deal with and the way she goes about life without ever complaining about it, I don't moan about the small things anymore. It could be much worse.""

It's nice that he's learned to appreciate life more and I'm glad I somehow helped him to do so but I'm not anything special. He's projecting how he *thinks* he'd feel if he were me, he's not seeing how *I* feel about being me. 

I really don't do anything to deserve the praise people give me. I'm mostly housebound, quite often bedbound and yet because I'm not suicidal I'm an ""inspiration"". 

My life is different but that doesn't mean bad. I'm happy and I see no reason not to smile and crack jokes but when people meet me it's always ""oh wow, I didn't expect you to be so happy, I thought you'd be all depressed. You're amazing!""

Even after showing people Stella's talk, a lot of able folks still don't get the point. They seem slightly offended somehow as though I'm not allowed to say ""Hey, thanks for thinking I'm awesome but please do it for the right reasons! There's nothing wrong with being 'like me' you know!"" 

It's as though they resent me for refusing to sit on their pedestal or be grateful that they use me to make themselves feel better about their own lives (as in, ""could be worse, I could be like her!""). Sorry guys but I don't spend all day wishing I was like you, you're not automatically better than me because you can walk.

Some do get it though and actively try to change their perspective. I thank those people, it's those people that will hopefully help pass the message along. I'll keep doing my best to change people's perceptions though and any progress is welcome.

&gt;Most canes used by blind people are white, but they are also available in red, black, yellow, and blue; for example...However, only a white cane identifies the user as a person who is blind or has low vision

From the second result -

&gt;I've also read about the ""yellow cane with visually impaired written on it"" is starting to become popular and is a great alternative to the white cane, so people dont' think I'm a hoax.

So, a yellow cane doesn't mean anything.  Only a white cane means that someone is blind or visually impaired.  Using or owning a yellow cane is just a choice people can make.

152da5c1-eb26-4f38-a9a3-b3db8175c0c2,1424686416,"well, there are basically two ways to ""stabilize"" your pictures: optical image stabilization (a small motor keeps moving a lens to compensate the movement of the camera) or simply by using a very high shutter speed (only capturing a very short moment, so the movement won't matter). 

as both of these are very different and depend highly on the extend of movement they should ""compensate"", I would recommend trying both in a shop. get your hands on a professional SLR with stabilized optics. the higher prices canon/nikon lenses with optical stabilization should show you what's possible with this method. if you're happy with the results, you can look at consumer products and just try them in a shop. 

i love the stabilization of my SLR lenses, but only use them to compensate for minor movements.

oh, one tip I can give you but I'm not sure if it works in your situation: take a screw nut and tie it to a rope about 3/4 of your body size. tie the other end of the rope to your camera (I use a bipod plate like this that gets screwed into the camera: http://www.videoslr.de/media/j10_s55_c0014-slider_stativplatte_von_unten_ausschnitt_p530.jpg) now step on the screw-nut (which only is there to keep the rope hanging down) so that there is enough tension on the rope (you have to pull up the camera a little bit). this tension can compensate for a lot of shaking and I use this method as a light weight tripod.

Nobody talks about curing people with severe dyslexia. Why is autism discussed as though it is something that could be cured?

I want to alleviate the suffering and struggles that many folks on the spectrum face. The search for ""a cure"" doesn't do that. It does not help provide communication devices to autistic people who are nonverbal, for instance.

The stereotype that every autistic person who is against a cure must be ""high-functioning"" is wrong. Look up the video ""In My Language"", by a nonverbal autistic woman.

Autism can be treated. Trying to ""cure"" it is like trying to cure someone from being gay. The reason some autistic people want to be ""cured"" is because they have internalized the message that society tells them - that autism makes their mind ""defective"".

That's exactly what gay people have been told when homosexuality was considered a mental illness. No civilized society thinks that homosexuality can be ""cured"" anymore. I find it disturbing that people still think autism is something that can be ""cured"".",2,0,2,0,0,

My saviour was a food processor and soupmaker. I love soup and was given my soupmaker, but if you're buying yourself I'd go for a crockpot/slow cooker before a soupmaker as you'll get more variety from it, although it won't blend like a soupmaker does and will be a lot slower. My soupmaker does a blended soup in 20 minutes which is pretty amazing.

With the processor you just turn it on and whack things in. Mine has a variety of slicing attachments which come in different sizes and shapes, it also grates, mixes, grinds and probably some other things I don't know about. The disks are blunt around the edge so no danger of cutting yourself when swapping blades either. Easy to clean, just rinse after cutting then a quick wipe round with a soapy cloth after. Emergency cutout so it doesn't blow up if you have a fit while using it. Zero danger to your hands. I buy my 'meat' ready chopped and I'd imagine if that exists for vegetarians there must be pre-chopped real meat out there. You can also buy bags of pre-cut salad, but personally I just tear the lettuce by hand, process the cucumber/carrot and add other leaves like rocket and spinach which are in small pieces anyway.

Once chopped you just transfer stuff to your slow cooker/soupmaker, set the timer and ignore. You can make so many things in a slow cooker. Soups, stews, casseroles, curry, roast, pizza, desserts...the list goes on and on. /r/slowcooking has some great ideas. The only dangerous part of this whole process is ladling out hot food which your bf could always do when he gets home. 

I also use a microwave for things like baked potatoes, rice, some egg dishes, fish, steamed veg, couscous, and most importantly, cake. These could also be made as an accompaniment to whatever's in the slow cooker. And it's the same deal, cut in processor, bung in microwave, set timer, walk away. Easy as pie. ",1,0,1,0,0,

He will need an official diagnosis severe enough to be unable to work in order to get SSI.   You can also check medicaid waivers for your state but generally they require the recipient to either have a low IQ or severe medical and/or physical disabilities.   For IQ you can see if you can get access to his school records the school should have been doing IQ testing.    Yes, the IQ testing results are considered valid by state and federal entities if it is within a reasonable time frame.    Also I would try and look to see what his transition plan with the school was it might give you some ideas and places to check out.   The school is supposed to do a transition plan when they age out of the ESE school system at 21.  In all actuality it should have been discussed at the IEP meetings for years.   This issue has comes up at every IEP meeting since my son has entered into the school system at the age of three but school is supposed to work with the family to make the transition smooth.    

Get him evaluated.   I would get him on Medicaid if you can and try to get psychological and IQ evaluations done (if not already done so).   Also have his hearing and eye sight checked.  I don't care if you think his sense are fine, you would be surprised how well people with hearing and vision problems learn to adapt.  My son has an IQ of less then 60 and his vision is so bad he qualifies for federally funded services for the blind yet he gives off zero outward clues about how poor his eyesight is, most people think I'm lying when I tell them how bad his eye sight is.  

Once you have official diagnosis you can see if he qualifies for a assisted living situation in a group home or maybe get him set up to live on his own with people assisting him in his independence.  

Also try not to be too hard on the school system.   My sister has worked in special education for decades and every year she has at least one case the school could help but can't because the parents refuse to cooperate and would prefer to pretend the disability doesn't exist at all.

3.  I had a nervous breakdown in the parking lot on the way to see the geneticist because several fatal conditions were on the list of possibilities.   I felt relief when I found out his genetic syndromes would not be a death sentence.  I felt anger at the geneticist when I did further research and found out they didn't tell me half of what I needed to know about his syndromes. 

4.  Currently, financial problems due to medical expenses and his needing one on one care are the biggest issue.   If you had asked me this a year ago when he was going through chronic pain I would have said watching a child writhe in pain and being powerless to fix his issues.   Helplessness makes you feel like the biggest parenting failure because every kid should have the ultimate faith that their Mom and Dad can fix things for them.   Reality teaches these children how to grow up faster then they should.

6.   Dying, it is a toss up either way whether it be his death or mine.   No parent wants to bury their child but from the perspective of his welfare it would be better if I outlived him.  The only family that would be willing to care for him are much older then me so unless I meet an earlier then expected death he will be left alone at the mercy of the state.  The state would most likely warehouse him in a nursing home to spend the rest of his life since he is too medically involved to go into a group home.  

7 No siblings, I have a balanced version of his reciprocal translocation which means there is a 50% probability of conceiving another child with two genetic syndromes.   I would not abort a child healthy or otherwise because it is against my beliefs but I also will not purposely conceive a child with such a high probability of health and developmental problems.    

8.   You have to care for yourself or you burn out and then have nothing left for anyone else.    The other way I cope is by compartmentalizing.  When life gets too overwhelming, start focusing on the now and what you can control.   The rest will work itself out eventually, worrying yourself to death doesn't help anyone.  

9.   Therapies - Physical, occupational, speech and adapted PE.  He is in a self contained classroom.   He loves school and to be honest learning with other children is far more motivating then watching an adult model something for him.  

10.  A-  They are excellent but there is always a little room for improvement.  The only issue in the past I had was they were terrible at handling a child in chronic pain.   They would constantly try to send him home as being sick.  Despite explanations, doctor notes and me telling them I would be happy to come by and give him his Lortab.    I do not let school nurses give medication due to past medication mistakes that could have resulted in permanent neurological harm.

11.   His previous teacher was a little too easy on him and babied him too much.  He won't work any harder then he is forced to do.  His new teacher expected him to work.   Her hard nosed but loving approach was what he needed.   Love does not mean permissiveness.  This is more inclined to the nursing side but please listen to a parent when we say the normal way doesn't work.   When there are multiple medical and developmental issues sometimes we have to get inventive to make things work.   That means that care might not be traditional.   

12.   There is no right way to be a special needs parent.  Every situation is unique respect that, trying to force the parent or child into some cookie cutter fashion will only frustrate everyone.  ",1,0,1,0,0,

I have an Invacare Spectra XTR2 but I have it with a few of the custom options. I had them swap out the entire seat, headrest and armrests for moulded pressure foam with a waterproof cover, changed the joystick to lengthen it, custom fabricated joystick frame (it sat too high and hurt my arm with the standard position), I swapped out the tiny smooth front castor wheels for big chunky, grippy ones, I went for the softest suspension available to avoid sharp jolts and I opted for adjustable ""leg raising"" footrests (again with the moulded foam/waterproof cover) so I could choose what angle my legs are at. 

Everything bar the change to the joystick frame is available as an option from invacare anyway so they're all made to fit the chair perfectly and are easily replaced if needed. 

I can take some photos in the next few days if you'd like to see it? 

It's a pretty tough chair, I live in a series of steep rural valleys in England, surrounded by forests and farmland so I needed something that can cope with the hills and lets me get out into the forest. As long as it's not completely boggy ground, my chair handles muddy trails with ease and even climbs an almost 45 degree gravel path at full speed as if it's not even there. 

I can't honestly remember if I had to have any changes made to get completely sealed battery housings and joystick controls but it's obviously possible.

I love my chair, in case you can't tell, hehe. ",2,0,2,0,0,

One thing that would be good is to wait for her to bring up how she got in a wheelchair. Then you can have a conversation about any limitations, etc. If you've been dating a while and she never brings it up, that'd be a different story.

In my experience, a lot of people are curious immediately and want to talk about it right away, which can feel a bit like being seen as *just* a ""disabled person,"" so good on you for not bringing it up on the first date (especially with little relevant experience).

Here's how i manage; more time to get anywhere, good set of gloves, layers, and no exposed skin.  As a manual chair user i don't worry about falling/slipping on ice and i don't take risks at getting stuck in the snow.  If i do get stuck i can kinda ""hop"" my chair over a bit to where can get traction.  I talked with my boss and can wear jeans all winter long instead of dress pants because the snow and ice and salt damage my pants.  I have salt and a shovel in my van incase i have to dig myself to a sidewalk.  The biggest thing though is that since we live in an area that gets a lot of this white crap it knows how to deal with it for the most part.  Storms dropping 2ft+ of snow at a time are kinda common.  Just drive slower and don't be stupid and you'll be fine.  I also have to replace caster bearings every year cause they wear out a lot faster up here.

What really sucks is that all this crap limits what i can get out and do.  I can't go visit neighbors, or head to down without driving, or just go for a 'walk'.  If it gets really bad out i don't feel right asking my friends to come over so i don't see them as much....except for one who'd walk anywhere in a blizzard, but he's crazy.

Here's what i've seen other ppl have to deal with; power chairs are worse because they can get stuck a lot easier in the layers of ice and snow.  They can't just ""hop"" themselves out so they usually don't go anywhere by themselves.  Some have had to basically build a tent over themselves and their chair to keep snow/ice from damaging the equipment.  If you must go alone, tell someone where youre going and how long you'll expect to take, we've had people in power chairs die to exposure cause they went out at night by themselves and hit problems.

People with disabilities but can still walk and those ""normals"" kind of adopt a penguin-sque style of walking.  Feet a little wider apart, shorter gait, slower.  If you rush, you'll fall.  Don't be afraid to ask for help, four legs are sturdier then two.  Oh, and again, its layers, don't just buy one large puffy coat and call it quits.  Youre average winter day here i'm rocking 3-4 layers of clothing before my winter coat.

Just go slow, don't take to many risks, assume everything is icy, be safe and good luck with your ""Snowpocalypse""

I have had no problems pushing him and pulling the cart behind me.  Handling both is not a problem even when he was more involved and needed a tilt in space wheelchair (which with seating weighted in at over 60lbs for the chair alone).  

I also have a lot of other concerns.   The cart puts the pusher in the kicking zone and I know my kid and likely other kids will kick their legs around and kick the parent.  Getting kicked with an AFO hurts!   My other thought is it is likely to be more use to someone who is slightly more ambulatory because unless it is right next to your car (unlikely) you either have to physically carry the child in or bring the wheelchair in and then leave it at the front.  I do not like leaving chairs worth $3,000 or more unattended in a public spaces.  Then on top of those concerns do additional transfers between seating which is even more difficult given my son is hooked up to pumps and more transfers are a strain on us both and increase the likelihood of equipment, ports and tubing being damaged.   Then I would have to worry about where to put his pump and how to attach his tubing in such a way that it wouldn't get caught and pull his port out.   There is also no side opening which means more strain on a person's back to get a non-ambulatory child into the chair rather then just sliding them across.   It just seems far too impractical to me.   I am giving this product a review from the prospective of a parent who has an involved child that uses a wheelchair and is technologically dependent.

I can say that although I would have loved to have had a mom who could have done more stuff for me and gone places with me, these factors are definitely a lot less relevant to my life than my mom thinks it is. I personally feel that I would not be the same person had my mom not been disabled, and although life was harder, I am definitely a much better person for having had the childhood I had. 

Many people my age take things for granted, whereas I have learned that I am blessed to have the life that I have. I have learned so many things from my mom, even though she couldn't/can't physically do much. I am a compassionate, empathic person because of her. I don't know what sort of disability you have, but I promise you that great parenting comes in many forms. I am very skeptical of the idea that you are ""letting them down."" 

Nevertheless, I understand that you feel guilty for what you ""can't"" do. It is also likely that there will be a point in your children's lives where they feel some resentment towards the fact that you're not like the other moms and dads. This is normal, and it's okay. Just because you and your children would prefer to be in a different situation does not make you a bad parent. I mean, if all of their friends are spoiled with tons of toys and gadgets and get fancy expensive cars on their 16th birthday, and your children don't, they'll probably resent that, too. But just because you don't buy your child expensive things doesn't make you a bad parent. You would not be ""letting them down"" (although they may see it that way). The same goes for your disability. It would be nice if you weren't disabled. But there is nothing wrong with it and you are not ""letting them down."" Do you want your kids to become good people? Do you want them to become capable adults? Then teach them how to be good people! Teach them how to be capable adults! I can't imagine your disability will get in the way. You may think it will, but a parent's love and devotion really does have a tendency to get around those sorts of things.

My visual snow syndrome makes me feel very very far away from everything and my typing and my reading are the only two things that keep my mind off of killing myself. I constantly feel like I'm in a bad dream that I need to switch off. 

I'm worried about the possibility of misrepresenting myself, though. I'm not even sure how I'd even prove that my syndrome is hurting my quality of life. Well, it does make reading almost impossible, and, I mean, I did drop out of college and quit quite a few jobs, but, I've never actually done anything too over the top, I think. If you were to ask me why I quit my jobs I'd say that I was quitting my jobs because it was existentially necessary that I do so...

For a back injury, what's way more important than ROM tests (although those do matter) are the x-rays.  Objective data is the gold standard.  If your x-rays, CT scans, MRI's don't show at least moderate joint or disc damage, then you'd probably get disapproved even if your ROM (which are subjective except for straight leg lifts) demonstrated very limited range.  Conversely, if you show significant damage via imaging, then you'll probably get approved even if your ROM is fairly good.  

I am surprised that gait wasn't checked though, but if it's not in the record it won't matter.  It might hurt your case if the CE says you had normal gait, but if other records contradict it and you have x-rays demonstrating an objective condition, it probably won't matter too much.  There are plenty of times where I've seen ALJ's give CE's little weight because they did a crappy exam.

Regarding Fibro and vertigo not being checked, I'm not sure about the vertigo, but a CE will almost never do a fibro exam.  Also, just FYI, because fibro is purely subjective and has no objective evidence, it's pretty hard to get approved for it.

I continually struggle with the theoretical concept of deafness: is it a disability (as in ""broken""/medical/pathological), or is it a Disability (the theoretical dimensions--societal, cultural, affective, a facet of identity)?

Most disability claims are reviewed every 3 or 7 years. Disabilities that have no chance of improving are every 7 years (sometimes longer depending on the disability) whereas others are every 3. Social Security can still decide to review before the 7 years (or 3) are up if they think there is cause to.

There's also not really an automatic discharge the way that it sounds like you're describing. It's a lengthy process requiring tons of documentation. 

All that said, since you're on a 3-year review cycle, that seems to indicate that Social Security thinks your disability could improve. If this is even a slight possibility for you, tread lightly because not only will they reinstate your loans, they will add on the interest. If, however, you are reasonably sure that your condition is not going to improve and you feel some certainty that your disability benefits are going to remain as is, I would urge you to apply but don't use your Social Security award letter as documentation (since, yes, they'll look askance at the 3-year review part). Use your doctor instead. In fact, the application itself urges the same thing (to get a doctor to fill out the forms if you don't have a 5-7 year review letter).

I'm sorry if I'm explaining this badly. It's a really complicated process and I got a ton of misinformation before I finally worked through everything. I should also mention that the laws were changed a little bit a few months after I applied. I'm pretty sure that when I was applying, they didn't take award letters as documentation, you *had* to have a doctor fill out the forms and they wanted a hell of a lot more info than the new application asks for.

EDIT: Yep. I did some research. About two months after I applied they started allowing award letters as documentation. That's what threw me off about your comments. So I doubly recommend applying but using your doctor instead of the letter for your documentation process.

EDIT 2: Good luck. Just trying to explain all this has brought back some of the anxiety I felt going through it so I really hope you're able to get your application approved. I know how awful it is trying to sort through it all. ",1,0,1,0,0,

This is from Lennard Davis and should be of interest of you. 

[Biocultures Manifesto](http://lennarddavis.com/?p=45)

The answer, I feel ultimately lays in our History. You can trace the state of modern deaf community all way back to the Scientific Revolution in 16th century, that started and helped the Cartesian paradigm seize control of our consciousness. (Still getting into this. Join me if you want, I just started[ The Reenchatment of the World](http://smile.amazon.com/The-Reenchantment-World-Morris-Berman/dp/0801492254))

Cartesian paradigm divides Body and Mind. With Body and Mind divided, it is possible to reason that Body has nothing to do with Mind. Then inject the idea of ""normality"" (that was also a consequence of Scientific Revolution) into it and you have people trying to mold people into ""normality,"" regardless of what their Body or Mind are. When, in fact, both Mind and Body are a whole.

My Body does not relay soundwaves from my ears to my brain. Therefore, my Mind does not interpret information that is encoded in soundwaves in the same way hearing people do. My Body still can sense soundwaves via tactile means, but my Mind lacks the know-how to interpret that fully. My Body sends my Mind the full array of visual information (at least much as humans as species can get). My Mind interprets the visual information and is able to do so more effectively because it does not have to shift through as much soundwaves. My Body responds to that by developing certain areas of my brain to become more efficient in visual processing... 

Normality ignores all of that and asserts that Normality's way is the best. [THE. BEST. 
](http://www.deafhood.us/wp/archives/626?cat=introduction) But Normality, in the end, is still a puppet, a tool.

[Strong communities are hard to mold... so they are divided, repeatedly.](http://www.deafhood.us/wp/archives/1702?cat=c2) (00:35 - 01:14) It is not enough to only think about the deaf community, you have to think about other communities that are around... and not necessarily just other communities, but also bigger communities that the deaf community is also part of.

The deaf community avoided the ""disability"" label on purpose, just like how women, people of color, and oppressed communities avoided it when fighting for Emancipation.

One of the most obvious examples of latent ableism I can think of is disabled bodies constantly being left out of body-positivity campaigns/discussions. I keep seeing this happen online, but when I was living and working with people who actually study/make a career out of social justice, this sort of thing never happened. Inclusivity was a big deal.

I can't say much about the process during the initial and reconsideration hearing levels, as I don't directly participate in them; but if you get denied on your initial evaluation you can always appeal and submit more evidence for your reconsideration hearing (assuming you're not in a prototype state), and if you get denied on that, you can submit more evidence and appeal to an administrative law judge (ALJ).

If you run into this same issue when petitioning the ALJ (medical records not being in at the time of the hearing), you can request that they hold the file open until you get the relevant documentation into them (if you get an attorney, they'll know what to do, and ALJ will hold a file open for a reasonable amount of time, usually a month or two).

Interestingly enough, I also work as a law student clerk for a non-profit disability rights law firm where I work in the PADD (Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Developmental Disabilities) program.

Because I'm in New York, I'll be going off of a New York perspective, and I have to preface that it may be different if you're from another state. Rules are a bit different from K-12 to post-secondary. Most colleges will have a dedicated accommodations officer under a student services office. E-mail them and set up a meeting with them. They're there to help you and find out what you need and what they can do and offer to assist with managing stress. It's kinda hard to say what legally they're suppose to provide (without poking and prodding). But if you needed to find the laws, they'd most likely be housed both with state education/higher education law and the agency regulation and rules regarding higher education (e.g. the New York Code, Rules and Regulations). But in general, the IDEA does not cover college/post-secondary education and it's just a matter of routine and common practice to use the ADA and 504 of the Rehab Act if disputes arise. ",1,0,1,0,0,

* A very portable folding chair that is lightweight enough for older adults to carry. I'm thinking this would be helpful if they have longer trips on foot and need a place to sit and rest if they can't find a bench. Maybe a shoulder strap would help.

The traditional FM systems are used a lot by school districts for students with hearing loss, but they're kind of bulky and kids hate to wear them. A remodeling like a pen could be the tipping point for making it ""normal"" enough to want to use. 

* Storm the smart watch market with some disability-centric stuff: simple but versatile med reminders, multiple appointment chimes, audio reads of emails/texts, pre-programmed personal information if a person with dementia becomes lost, some pre-programmed sayings for someone with aphasia, hearing loss, or nonverbal communication. 

* Safety alarms (smoke, carbon monoxide, door bell, alert for weather alarms outside) designed for individuals with hearing/vision loss. I know something like this is already on the market, but there are many elderly people who are unaware it exists that could benefit from it. Making it more mainstream basically. 

* Sensory tools like fidgets or headphones that help keep people with sensory sensitivities/needs centered.

He's my only one, so he's been spoiled since birth. Road trips to the beach 6+ times a summer, movies all the time, going out to eat, shopping and getting whatever he wanted. He wasn't a spoiled brat, though. We had two incomes and one child, so we could afford it.

Today, I sometimes need his help to get out of bed. He often has to fetch me socks, or drinks, or make meals for us, as my husband works a lot. I can't work anymore, and am waiting on social security and medicaid (which means we're paying out of pocket for medical things, which adds up to a lot). 

However, we have kept a very open dialog with him. My husband brought him to the hospital almost everyday to visit me when I was there getting spinal surgeries for the whole month of December. I tell him daily how much I appreciate him, how sorry I am that we can't do the fun things that we used to, and how much I love him. 

He's a smart kid. He gets it. Is he miffed that he doesn't get to do all kinds of cool fun stuff? Probably. But you'd never know it.

We've kept his karate lessons on the budget, even though we're spread extremely thin at the moment, so he gets something that's 'his' several times a week.

Myself, I find that with my paralyzed hands I need a bigger body and shoot a full-size Nikon DSLR with almost exclusively professional class. My one smaller lens, a 50 mm f/1.8 is actually too small for me to get a grip on to hold steady. That is my weakness so I guess it depends on that.

I also used to be a hunter and target shooter and found that often heavier rifles were easier to hold steady. It may be that a bigger body is easier for you to hold and minimizes your tremor or it may be that a small one is easier for you. Most camera stores should be pretty good about letting you try a few things to see what works well for you.

I used to shoot Pentax because I really appreciated them having the image stabilization built into the body so every lens had that benefit but there were autofocus in one of the first DSLR's steered me toward Nikon. I did find that the vibration reduction built into the lenses was more effective than early in body image stabilization. I don't know where that technology is at compared to in-lens stabilization.

I would suggest taking a memory card with you to the store, shoot on a few different bodies with a few different lenses, go home and look at the photos and go from there.

Even with my fairly ample strength I am sometimes a bit shaky when shooting if I happen to have low blood sugar or too much caffeine. I almost always use off-camera flash and it has become my style and a way I am able to stand out from the average ambient light shooter. Those short flash durations almost always guarantee sharp photos, as long as my focus is spot on. Just a suggestion for you to consider if you are finding that no vibration reduction is adequate for your limitation.

Best wishes and keep us updated!",1,0,1,0,0,

For the places that still can't be reached by hands and a cloth, he made a little ""stick"" with a small clamp on the end that can hold the cloth and be inserted into the tough areas. 

It kind of looks like one of those ""self wipe"" toileting aids you can buy online so maybe one of those would work? They have a straight handle and then an angled end, some may even have adjustable angles. 

When I've been somewhere muddy and gross, I drive my chair straight into the shower (it's a level entry, ""wetroom"" type bathroom and shower), turn the detachable shower head to the smallest setting so it blasts out in a thin stream and then thoroughly blast all the dirt from the wheels, frame and underside of the chair.

I know my chair and battery housings are 100% waterproof though. Be careful exposing your electronics to water like that unless you're sure that it's safe (I was able to check with the company that does repairs on my chair as to what level of waterproofing I have).

If you have access to an outdoor water source and hosepipe you could do this before entering the house to avoid tracking in any mud. 

The rest of the time my chair gets a once a week wipe down with antibacterial cloths in all of the places that can be reached without dismantling it.

You can often get the grocery store butcher to pre-slice meats for you (even the pre-packaged stuff; you don't have to spend the premium to get it from the meat counter) if you ask nicely and explain your situation.  

I cook almost all my meals in the microwave these days because, like you, I cannot stand for more than a few minutes.  I do everything sitting down, and kept burning myself on the (regular height) stove, so I started adapting everything to the microwave. I bought a microwave ""pasta and rice cooker"" which is awesome.  I can make a orzo-pasta-and-cheese in one bowl - no draining required.  You can cook omelets and scrambled eggs in the microwave, and quiches -- look up recipes for ""mug foods"" which are all microwave based.  I got silicone baking pans and bake cornbread and pan cookie in the microwave.  

It takes a little patience and trial and error (my first batch of microwave biscuits were hockey pucks) but you can cook almost everything in a microwave.   My next step is a slow cooker so I can make big batches of things at once.",1,0,1,0,0,

Instead, I found myself missing the myriad things to do in little A2 &amp; Ypsilanti. 
24 hour grocery stores, wide sidewalks and free parallel parking or paid covered parking right next to elevators plus phenomenal doctors/food/eduction and quite cheap cost of living ='s my cup of tea :)
There are also tons of beautiful things to do outdoors in the spring/summer/fall. 
The trails at the metro, state and national parks are so well marked and accessible that I've gone in hikes overtop the sand dunes NWB with the shittiest crutches you've ever seen. I can even go on up to2 mile hikes at some state parks because they have easy, flat trails with benches or other places to sit every 50 feet. Or forget hiking and just rent a cabin on Lake Michigan or Lake Huron for a week/end and you'll never miss salt water again :)
Also Detroit. It isn't ever going to be what it was in it's hay day, but there are many wonderful things to do in the slowly revitalizing city. The People Mover makes downtown easier to get around and there is parking everyplace. Just go with people who know the area and do your research but it's not some dangerous hell and you can spend a wonderful Saturday morning at the Eastern Market (kind of a bitch on crutches go on a slow day and you won't have to beat your way through throngs of people), and then head over to Mexican Village for some baked goods and greasy delicious breakfast :)

c741bb69-da08-4045-b9ff-cb742841306c,1424571798,"I am willing to tell you about my experience with disability: At 34, I had finally gotten my life together; I was raising a wonderful son with a devoted husband. I had finished my Bachelor's and was literally weeks away from finishing my Master's. I had obtained a position in my field and was doing well, according to feedback from my coworkers and supervisors. 

Then I woke up one morning and couldn't move my legs. It was about 6 am when my husband woke up. I had been attempting to move them for about an hour, as I woke up at 5 am with the need to urinate. My husband called 911 and EMTs showed up. They came into my bedroom and were extremely rude. Asked things like 'What do you expect us to do?' Um, take me to the hospital? Like, wtf? So they refused to take me to the hospital. Stating that they would have to 'yank [me] up out of the bed' and drag me to the ambulance, where I would experience a horribly bumpy ride to the ER, when I 'probably just need an ice pack and some Aleve'. They treated me like I was making it up for pain medication. Horrified, belittled and dejected, I asked them to leave. My husband carried me to the bathroom while I was in tears and literally screaming from the pain. Then he had to go to work, and I kept my son home from school in case I needed something. He fetched me water and made us sandwiches for lunch, all while I lay in bed in horrendous pain, unable to move. 

That night, my husband took me to a small ER center, where I was given pain medicine intravenously and a prescription. I left that ER high as a kite, only to have the pain return and continue to worsen over the next few days. I spoke with my cousin, who is a nurse in a different state, and she told me if I lost control of my bladder and/or bowels, to go back to the ER immediately. What do you know, 3 days later, I was pissing myself, so my husband loaded me back into his car (where I had to recline the seat and lay on my side) and back to the same ER. They checked me out, and said I needed to go to another ER for imaging. Apparently they didn't want to call their radiology techs in. (It was late on a Friday.) So back into the uncomfortable reclined front seat position and off to another hospital. (Which is where the ambulance from three days ago would have taken me.) 

This hospital scanned me, and within minutes the Physician’s Assistant and nurses were informing me NOT to move, and hopping me up on all kinds of fun drugs. I was told that the neurosurgeon was on his way, and I was carted off to an emergency spinal surgery. I was diagnosed with an extremely rare condition, where surgery needs to be performed within 24-48 hours to have the best chance at not resulting in paralyzation. I was in the hospital for weeks, where I had another spinal surgery shortly after the first because I was leaking spinal fluid.

The surgeries were in December of last year. I got out of the hospital shortly before Christmas, and started my journey toward learning how to live with this condition that I have. 

I still have a near impossible time walking unassisted. (I tried to go outside and have fun in the snow with my family today. I took it easy and stayed slow and upright. Only to roll my ankle twice. Hard.) I still have bouts of incontinence, but if I sit on the toilet and empty my bladder every 2 hours or so, I can keep it at bay. I can't drive. I can't feel my feet. It hurts. All the time. I am in constant pain. 

I can't drive, therefore I can't work. Even if I could drive, I wouldn't be able to perform the duties of my chosen career, or any job for that matter. I can't sit for extended periods; I can't walk well or at a pace faster than a snail. I don't know of many jobs that will let you lay down every hour or two. Or nap each afternoon, which I really need to do 9 days out of 10. 

I have applied for Medicaid through my state, as I lost my insurance. I have also applied for Social Security Disability (I cried when I hit the 'submit' button). I purchased an insurance plan on the marketplace, but it's not in effect until March 1st, and very expensive. I have a doctor's appointment March 2nd. We have started talking about selling my car (the payment and auto insurance is close to how much my insurance will cost, and it's been sitting unused for two months anyway). I know there will be more tears that day. Our finances are spread thin, but we’re surviving. Our bills are paid, at least on the things they can take away from us like rent and car payments. I know it’s hard on my husband being the sole breadwinner, but he’s been absolutely amazing. He works a physically demanding job, and comes home to cook and clean and do laundry without once being a dick about it. I don’t know that I would be dealing with it as well. 

On top of the physical, what so many people don't realize is the mental issues. I had depression when I was younger, but I've been off all medication for a good ten years. Since becoming disabled, I have noticed the depression as an uninvited, invasive guest settling itself into my head for the long haul. If not for my husband and son (and pets, they need me too), I don't know that I would still be here. Some days swallowing a bullet sounds so much better than getting up and swallowing a thousand pills to make it through the day.

If you can walk a couple of miles you can hike the same distance.  Tho hiking on uneven ground is a little harder.  Most trails aren't constant up hill.  They vary depending on the area.  Be sure to check a trail's rating to know what you can expect on that trail.  In some places you might have to think through a way to do some things. Like if there is only a large log to get past a stream.  Personally I wouldn't feel comfortable walking over most logs, so I'd probably sit on the log and scoot across it to the the other side.  

Your prosthesis will make a difference while hiking.  A Renegade Foot is going to be much better than a Sach Foot.  I have two prosthetics.  My everyday leg has a Ossur Proprio Foot on that has a microprocessor and hydraulics in it to help going up and down stairs and other everyday stuff.  It can't get wet tho.  It's not water proof so if I'm out hiking or fishing and it got submerged it would kill it.  So for hiking I use my old leg that I can still wear that has a Freedom Innovations Renegade Foot on it.  The Renegade can get completely submerged with no worries.  I even wear it kayaking.

If you want to go hiking do it!  Just take your time and of course follow normal hiking safety.  Never go hiking alone.  Bad stuff can happen and you don't want to be 5 miles from the nearest road with no one there to help you if you get hurt, sick, or lost.  Be sure to take extra stump socks with you too.

Yes, you are risking your job.

However, I also believe that this person should be allowed to partake in ""illegal-ish"" activities as much as any able bodied person..
Police and governments are aware that ppl smoke weed- It is something that goes under the radar for the most part... this person would regularly be able to do so, however their mobility does not allow them to do so without assistance

I believe that I would try to help this person have access to marijuana for medicinal purposes- even recreational.
However, it can put you in a risky position.

Perhaps you could arrange for a trusted person to do a drop off of the marijuana, at the house where this person resides.  this person could instruct  you to put money in an envelope-- as they may have you do for other bills--- and you could leave the envelope where they instruct you to. 

If smell is an issue, often marijuana is boiled or microwaved in milk -- and it gives a more mellow experience.

Just my two cents- there are probably more socially responsible alternatives offered here

They look like a normal watch but they allow family members to immediately locate the wearer.

I'm not sure how much they cost but my current carer used to work with Alzheimer's patients here in the UK and said that many of their families used the Keruve gps watch to ensure the safety of their loved ones.

Maybe it would be worth requesting a brochure. I'm not sure if it's available in Canada but it's available in many countries so you should be able to get hold of one.

I would however be very concerned by the fact that he can leave school so easily without being noticed. Especially as it seems that it's happened multiple times.

I walk slower normally anyways, so in the winter I have to slow it down even more. I wear a lot of layers, and I basically don't do anything except concentrate on where I am going. I'm practiced at it though because I've been dealing with it since about the age of 7 when my walking started to good enough to handle it. I used to fall a lot more in the winter though. I try to make sure I have shoes with good grips, but I don't have a lot of spare money so usually for part of the winter either I have less grippy than ideal shoes, or my shoes leak ):

I also learned that you should try and move your centre of gravity forwards! And I have to focus to be able to do that (it's like with skiing, which I can do, but it takes a lot of concentration).

I hate that accessible stalls are usually where they put the baby changing tables.   I get it, they have a lot of room. But when there are other places to put the changing table, it's infuriating.

There's a restaurant I used to love to go to.  Their bathrooms are up stairs, so they built a separate accessible bathroom that has no stairs.   The last time I was there I went to use the accessible bathroom and it was locked.  I waited for a minute for the person inside to come out when some random customer took pity on me and said there was nobody in there; they just kept the door locked.

I went and hunted down a manager, and we had a ""you're not listening to me"" conversation.  I kept pointing out that able people don't have to ask permission to go to the bathroom. She kept telling me that it was done ""for my own benefit, so non-disabled people don't use it.""

Talk about bathroom policing.  To this day I suspect that the real reason they had to start locking it is it is next to the bar, and they had a problem with drunks going in there to use drugs or have sex.
